### [1] [Diagnosing Bottlenecks in Data Visualization Understanding by Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21740)
*Alexa R. Tartaglini,Satchel Grant,Daniel Wurgaft,Christopher Potts,Judith E. Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FUGU是一个数据可视化理解任务套件，用于诊断视觉语言模型在理解数据可视化时的失败原因。研究发现错误主要源于视觉-语言模块间的信息传递问题，而非视觉编码或语言处理本身。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在基本的数据可视化理解任务上表现不佳，但失败原因尚不明确。研究旨在确定错误是源于视觉信息编码、视觉-语言模块间信息传递，还是语言模块处理的问题。

Method: 开发FUGU任务套件来精确表征困难来源，使用激活修补和线性探针技术追踪信息流，分析三种广泛使用的视觉语言模型在不同提示策略下的表现。

Result: 研究发现模型难以正确生成单个数据点坐标，这些初始错误常导致最终响应错误。提供正确坐标能显著提升性能，但仅对少量数据点任务有效，对需要统计关系的任务反而恶化性能。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型存在架构限制，可能对可靠的数据可视化理解构成重大挑战，错误主要源于视觉-语言模块间的信息传递问题。

Abstract: Data visualizations are vital components of many scientific articles and news
stories. Current vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle on basic data
visualization understanding tasks, but the causes of failure remain unclear.
Are VLM failures attributable to limitations in how visual information in the
data visualization is encoded, how information is transferred between the
vision and language modules, or how information is processed within the
language module? We developed FUGU, a suite of data visualization understanding
tasks, to precisely characterize potential sources of difficulty (e.g.,
extracting the position of data points, distances between them, and other
summary statistics). We used FUGU to investigate three widely used VLMs. To
diagnose the sources of errors produced by these models, we used activation
patching and linear probes to trace information flow through models across a
variety of prompting strategies. We found that some models fail to generate the
coordinates of individual data points correctly, and these initial errors often
lead to erroneous final responses. When these models are provided with the
correct coordinates, performance improves substantially. Moreover, even when
the model generates an incorrect response, the correct coordinates can be
successfully read out from the latent representations in the vision encoder,
suggesting that the source of these errors lies in the vision-language handoff.
We further found that while providing correct coordinates helps with tasks
involving one or a small number of data points, it generally worsens
performance for tasks that require extracting statistical relationships across
many data points. Fine-tuning models on FUGU also fails to yield ceiling
performance. These findings point to architectural constraints in current VLMs
that might pose significant challenges for reliable data visualization
understanding.

### [2] [Agro-Consensus: Semantic Self-Consistency in Vision-Language Models for Crop Disease Management in Developing Countries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21757)
*Mihir Gupta,Pratik Desai,Ross Greer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种成本效益高的自一致性框架，通过语义聚类和余弦相似度共识机制，提高视觉语言模型在农业图像描述中的可靠性，特别适用于资源受限的发展中国家。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发展中国家农业病害管理面临专家资源有限、网络连接不可靠和成本限制等挑战，阻碍了大规模AI系统的部署，需要开发更可靠的轻量级解决方案。

Method: 使用轻量级预训练嵌入模型进行语义聚类，通过余弦相似度选择最一致的描述，并加入人工确认作物类型的人机交互组件来过滤错误生成。

Result: 在PlantVillage数据集上，单聚类共识方法在10个候选生成时达到83.1%的准确率，优于贪婪解码的77.5%；多聚类情况下，前4个候选簇的准确率可达94.0%。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提高了农业图像描述的准确性，为资源受限环境下的农业病害管理提供了有效的轻量级AI解决方案。

Abstract: Agricultural disease management in developing countries such as India, Kenya,
and Nigeria faces significant challenges due to limited access to expert plant
pathologists, unreliable internet connectivity, and cost constraints that
hinder the deployment of large-scale AI systems. This work introduces a
cost-effective self-consistency framework to improve vision-language model
(VLM) reliability for agricultural image captioning. The proposed method
employs semantic clustering, using a lightweight (80MB) pre-trained embedding
model to group multiple candidate responses. It then selects the most coherent
caption -- containing a diagnosis, symptoms, analysis, treatment, and
prevention recommendations -- through a cosine similarity-based consensus. A
practical human-in-the-loop (HITL) component is incorporated, wherein user
confirmation of the crop type filters erroneous generations, ensuring
higher-quality input for the consensus mechanism. Applied to the publicly
available PlantVillage dataset using a fine-tuned 3B-parameter PaliGemma model,
our framework demonstrates improvements over standard decoding methods.
Evaluated on 800 crop disease images with up to 21 generations per image, our
single-cluster consensus method achieves a peak accuracy of 83.1% with 10
candidate generations, compared to the 77.5% baseline accuracy of greedy
decoding. The framework's effectiveness is further demonstrated when
considering multiple clusters; accuracy rises to 94.0% when a correct response
is found within any of the top four candidate clusters, outperforming the 88.5%
achieved by a top-4 selection from the baseline.

### [3] [Proportion and Perspective Control for Flow-Based Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21763)
*Julien Boudier,Hugo Caselles-Dupré*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了两个专门用于艺术控制的ControlNet：比例ControlNet使用边界框控制物体位置和大小，透视ControlNet使用消失线控制场景3D几何。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代文本到图像扩散模型生成高保真图像，但对输出空间和几何结构的控制有限。

Method: 开发了两个ControlNet模块：比例ControlNet通过边界框控制物体位置和比例，透视ControlNet通过消失线控制3D几何。使用视觉语言模型进行数据标注和专门的算法进行条件图像合成。

Result: 实验表明两个模块都提供了有效控制，但在复杂约束下存在局限性。

Conclusion: 两个ControlNet模型在艺术控制方面有效，已发布在HuggingFace平台上。

Abstract: While modern text-to-image diffusion models generate high-fidelity images,
they offer limited control over the spatial and geometric structure of the
output. To address this, we introduce and evaluate two ControlNets specialized
for artistic control: (1) a proportion ControlNet that uses bounding boxes to
dictate the position and scale of objects, and (2) a perspective ControlNet
that employs vanishing lines to control the 3D geometry of the scene. We
support the training of these modules with data pipelines that leverage
vision-language models for annotation and specialized algorithms for
conditioning image synthesis. Our experiments demonstrate that both modules
provide effective control but exhibit limitations with complex constraints.
Both models are released on HuggingFace:

### [4] [H2OFlow: Grounding Human-Object Affordances with 3D Generative Models and Dense Diffused Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21769)
*Harry Zhang,Luca Carlone*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: H2OFlow是一个无需人工标注、仅使用合成数据的3D人机交互(HOI)可操作性学习框架，通过密集3D流表示全面建模接触、方向和空间占用等交互属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法依赖人工标注数据集和仅关注接触分析的局限性，需要更全面理解人机交互中的方向偏好和空间占用等关键方面。

Method: 使用3D生成模型生成合成数据，通过点云上的密集扩散过程学习3D流表示，从而发现丰富的3D可操作性。

Result: H2OFlow在真实世界对象上表现出良好的泛化能力，在3D可操作性建模方面超越了依赖人工标注或网格表示的方法。

Conclusion: 该框架证明了仅使用合成数据就能有效学习全面的3D人机交互可操作性，为计算机视觉和机器人学提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding how humans interact with the surrounding environment, and
specifically reasoning about object interactions and affordances, is a critical
challenge in computer vision, robotics, and AI. Current approaches often depend
on labor-intensive, hand-labeled datasets capturing real-world or simulated
human-object interaction (HOI) tasks, which are costly and time-consuming to
produce. Furthermore, most existing methods for 3D affordance understanding are
limited to contact-based analysis, neglecting other essential aspects of
human-object interactions, such as orientation (\eg, humans might have a
preferential orientation with respect certain objects, such as a TV) and
spatial occupancy (\eg, humans are more likely to occupy certain regions around
an object, like the front of a microwave rather than its back). To address
these limitations, we introduce \emph{H2OFlow}, a novel framework that
comprehensively learns 3D HOI affordances -- encompassing contact, orientation,
and spatial occupancy -- using only synthetic data generated from 3D generative
models. H2OFlow employs a dense 3D-flow-based representation, learned through a
dense diffusion process operating on point clouds. This learned flow enables
the discovery of rich 3D affordances without the need for human annotations.
Through extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we demonstrate that
H2OFlow generalizes effectively to real-world objects and surpasses prior
methods that rely on manual annotations or mesh-based representations in
modeling 3D affordance.

### [5] [Multi-Agent Pose Uncertainty: A Differentiable Rendering Cramér-Rao Bound](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21785)
*Arun Muthukkumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于可微分渲染器的相机位姿估计协方差下界计算方法，通过将渲染器视为测量函数，在流形上线性化图像形成过程，得到渲染感知的Cramér-Rao下界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 位姿估计在计算机视觉和机器人领域至关重要，但目前很少有工作为密集或学习模型下的位姿提供严格的不确定性量化。

Method: 将可微分渲染器作为测量函数，在流形上对小的位姿扰动进行图像形成过程的线性化，推导出渲染感知的Cramér-Rao下界。

Result: 该方法可以简化为经典的捆绑调整不确定性，确保与视觉理论的连续性，并自然地扩展到多智能体设置，通过融合多个相机的Fisher信息。

Conclusion: 这种统计公式在下游任务中具有应用价值，如协作感知和无需显式关键点对应关系的新视角合成。

Abstract: Pose estimation is essential for many applications within computer vision and
robotics. Despite its uses, few works provide rigorous uncertainty
quantification for poses under dense or learned models. We derive a closed-form
lower bound on the covariance of camera pose estimates by treating a
differentiable renderer as a measurement function. Linearizing image formation
with respect to a small pose perturbation on the manifold yields a render-aware
Cram\'er-Rao bound. Our approach reduces to classical bundle-adjustment
uncertainty, ensuring continuity with vision theory. It also naturally extends
to multi-agent settings by fusing Fisher information across cameras. Our
statistical formulation has downstream applications for tasks such as
cooperative perception and novel view synthesis without requiring explicit
keypoint correspondences.

### [7] [Improving the Physics of Video Generation with VJEPA-2 Reward Signal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21840)
*Jianhao Yuan,Xiaofeng Zhang,Felix Friedrich,Nicolas Beltran-Velez,Melissa Hall,Reyhane Askari-Hemmat,Xiaochuang Han,Nicolas Ballas,Michal Drozdzal,Adriana Romero-Soriano*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该报告介绍了在ICCV 2025物理IQ挑战赛中获胜的方法，通过将VJEPA-2自监督学习模型与MAGI-1视频生成模型结合，利用VJEPA-2作为奖励信号来提升生成视频的物理合理性约6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的视频生成模型在物理理解方面存在严重限制，经常产生不合理的视频。物理IQ基准测试表明视觉真实感并不等同于物理理解，而自监督学习在自然视频上的预训练已显示出直觉物理理解能力。

Method: 在MAGI-1视频生成模型基础上，结合Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture 2 (VJEPA-2)来指导生成过程，利用VJEPA-2作为奖励信号。

Result: 通过使用VJEPA-2作为奖励信号，可以将最先进视频生成模型的物理合理性提升约6%。

Conclusion: 自监督学习为基础的视频世界模型可以有效提升视频生成模型的物理合理性，证明了SSL预训练在改善生成模型物理理解方面的潜力。

Abstract: This is a short technical report describing the winning entry of the
PhysicsIQ Challenge, presented at the Perception Test Workshop at ICCV 2025.
State-of-the-art video generative models exhibit severely limited physical
understanding, and often produce implausible videos. The Physics IQ benchmark
has shown that visual realism does not imply physics understanding. Yet,
intuitive physics understanding has shown to emerge from SSL pretraining on
natural videos. In this report, we investigate whether we can leverage
SSL-based video world models to improve the physics plausibility of video
generative models. In particular, we build ontop of the state-of-the-art video
generative model MAGI-1 and couple it with the recently introduced Video Joint
Embedding Predictive Architecture 2 (VJEPA-2) to guide the generation process.
We show that by leveraging VJEPA-2 as reward signal, we can improve the physics
plausibility of state-of-the-art video generative models by ~6%.

### [8] [Face-MakeUpV2: Facial Consistency Learning for Controllable Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21775)
*Dawei Dai,Yinxiu Zhou,Chenghang Li,Guolai Jiang,Chengfang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Face-MakeUpV2是一个面部图像生成模型，通过构建大规模数据集和引入3D面部渲染通道，解决了面部属性泄漏和物理一致性问题，在保持面部ID和物理特性一致性方面表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像模型在响应局部语义指令时存在面部属性泄漏和物理一致性不足的问题，需要开发能够保持参考图像面部ID和物理特性一致性的面部图像生成模型。

Method: 1. 构建包含约100万图像-文本-掩码对的大规模数据集FaceCaptionMask-1M；2. 使用通用文本到图像预训练模型作为主干，引入3D面部渲染通道和全局面部特征通道；3. 制定语义对齐和感知损失两个优化目标。

Result: 大量实验表明，Face-MakeUpV2在保持面部ID和参考图像物理一致性方面实现了最佳整体性能。

Conclusion: Face-MakeUpV2在各种应用中具有可靠和可控面部编辑的实际潜力。

Abstract: In facial image generation, current text-to-image models often suffer from
facial attribute leakage and insufficient physical consistency when responding
to local semantic instructions. In this study, we propose Face-MakeUpV2, a
facial image generation model that aims to maintain the consistency of face ID
and physical characteristics with the reference image. First, we constructed a
large-scale dataset FaceCaptionMask-1M comprising approximately one million
image-text-masks pairs that provide precise spatial supervision for the local
semantic instructions. Second, we employed a general text-to-image pretrained
model as the backbone and introduced two complementary facial information
injection channels: a 3D facial rendering channel to incorporate the physical
characteristics of the image and a global facial feature channel. Third, we
formulated two optimization objectives for the supervised learning of our
model: semantic alignment in the model's embedding space to mitigate the
attribute leakage problem and perceptual loss on facial images to preserve ID
consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our Face-MakeUpV2 achieves
best overall performance in terms of preserving face ID and maintaining
physical consistency of the reference images. These results highlight the
practical potential of Face-MakeUpV2 for reliable and controllable facial
editing in diverse applications.

### [9] [LSF-Animation: Label-Free Speech-Driven Facial Animation via Implicit Feature Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21864)
*Xin Lu,Chuanqing Zhuang,Chenxi Jin,Zhengda Lu,Yiqun Wang,Wu Liu,Jun Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出LSF-Animation框架，通过从语音中隐式提取情感信息和从中性面部网格中捕获身份特征，无需显式标签即可生成3D面部动画，解决了现有方法对未见说话者泛化能力不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音驱动的3D面部动画方法依赖显式的一热编码来表示身份和情感，限制了其对未见说话者的泛化能力，且忽视了语音中固有的情感线索。

Method: 提出LSF-Animation框架，包含隐式情感提取和身份特征捕获，并引入分层交互融合块(HIFB)来有效整合情感、运动和身份相关线索。

Result: 在3DMEAD数据集上的实验表明，该方法在情感表现力、身份泛化和动画真实感方面超越了现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: LSF-Animation通过消除对显式情感和身份特征表示的依赖，实现了对未见说话者和情感状态的更好泛化，提高了动画的自然性和适应性。

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation has attracted increasing interest since its
potential to generate expressive and temporally synchronized digital humans.
While recent works have begun to explore emotion-aware animation, they still
depend on explicit one-hot encodings to represent identity and emotion with
given emotion and identity labels, which limits their ability to generalize to
unseen speakers. Moreover, the emotional cues inherently present in speech are
often neglected, limiting the naturalness and adaptability of generated
animations. In this work, we propose LSF-Animation, a novel framework that
eliminates the reliance on explicit emotion and identity feature
representations. Specifically, LSF-Animation implicitly extracts emotion
information from speech and captures the identity features from a neutral
facial mesh, enabling improved generalization to unseen speakers and emotional
states without requiring manual labels. Furthermore, we introduce a
Hierarchical Interaction Fusion Block (HIFB), which employs a fusion token to
integrate dual transformer features and more effectively integrate emotional,
motion-related and identity-related cues. Extensive experiments conducted on
the 3DMEAD dataset demonstrate that our method surpasses recent
state-of-the-art approaches in terms of emotional expressiveness, identity
generalization, and animation realism. The source code will be released at:

### [10] [Ageing Drift in Binary Face Templates: A Bits-per-Decade Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21778)
*Abdelilah Ganmati,Karim Afdel,Lahcen Koutti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了紧凑二进制人脸模板的纵向稳定性，量化了年龄漂移为每十年比特数。通过PCA-ITQ将人脸CNN的浮点嵌入压缩为64位和128位代码，发现年龄差距与汉明距离呈线性关系，中位斜率分别为1.357和2.571比特/十年。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究紧凑二进制人脸模板在长时间跨度下的稳定性，这对于智能卡和卡上匹配部署等应用场景至关重要，需要了解年龄变化对模板匹配性能的影响。

Method: 使用AgeDB数据集，对每个至少有3个不同年龄的身份，形成所有真实配对，拟合汉明距离与绝对年龄差距的线性模型。通过PCA-ITQ将现代人脸CNN的浮点嵌入压缩为64位和128位二进制代码。

Result: 在566个身份中，64位模板的中位斜率为1.357比特/十年，128位模板为2.571比特/十年，分布主要为正值，表明类内距离随时间有系统性增加。较短的代码在固定决策阈值下具有更好的年龄稳定性。

Conclusion: 年龄漂移与代码长度成正比，提出了简单的缓解措施，如定期重新注册和对经验上不稳定的比特位置进行目标奇偶校验。提供了代码和CSV文件支持可重复性。

Abstract: We study the longitudinal stability of compact binary face templates and
quantify ageing drift directly in bits per decade. Float embeddings from a
modern face CNN are compressed with PCA-ITQ into 64- and 128-bit codes. For
each identity in AgeDB with at least three distinct ages, we form all genuine
pairs and fit a per-identity linear model of Hamming distance versus absolute
age gap. Across 566 identities, the median slope is 1.357 bits per decade for
64-bit templates and 2.571 bits per decade for 128-bit templates, with tight
non-parametric 95 percent bootstrap confidence intervals. The distributions are
predominantly positive, indicating a small but systematic increase in
intra-class distance over time. Because drift scales with code length, shorter
codes are inherently more age-stable at a fixed decision threshold. We connect
these slopes to operating characteristics by reporting EER and TPR at FAR = 1
percent in three age bins. We discuss implications for smart-card and
match-on-card deployments, including simple mitigations such as periodic
re-enrolment and targeted parity on empirically unstable bit positions. Code
and CSV artifacts are provided to support reproducibility.

*Bishal Chhetri,B. V. Rathish Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种可解释的深度学习框架，用于通过乳腺肿块细针穿刺图像的定量特征进行乳腺癌早期检测，在保持高准确率的同时提供模型解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在医疗应用中因黑盒特性而难以获得临床信任的问题，需要在保持高预测准确性的同时提高模型的可解释性。

Method: 使用ReLU激活函数、Adam优化器和二元交叉熵损失的深度神经网络，结合SHAP和LIME等模型无关的可解释AI技术生成特征级归因和可视化。

Result: 模型达到了0.992的准确率、1.000的精确率、0.977的召回率和0.988的F1分数，显著优于传统机器学习算法，并识别出细胞核凹点是影响分类的最重要特征。

Conclusion: 该框架成功弥合了深度学习模型性能与可解释性之间的差距，为乳腺癌的临床诊断提供了既准确又可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: In this study, we present an interpretable deep learning framework for the
early detection of breast cancer using quantitative features extracted from
digitized fine needle aspirate (FNA) images of breast masses. Our deep neural
network, using ReLU activations, the Adam optimizer, and a binary cross-entropy
loss, delivers state-of-the-art classification performance, achieving an
accuracy of 0.992, precision of 1.000, recall of 0.977, and an F1 score of
0.988. These results substantially exceed the benchmarks reported in the
literature. We evaluated the model under identical protocols against a suite of
well-established algorithms (logistic regression, decision trees, random
forests, stochastic gradient descent, K-nearest neighbors, and XGBoost) and
found the deep model consistently superior on the same metrics. Recognizing
that high predictive accuracy alone is insufficient for clinical adoption due
to the black-box nature of deep learning models, we incorporated model-agnostic
Explainable AI techniques such as SHAP and LIME to produce feature-level
attributions and human-readable visualizations. These explanations quantify the
contribution of each feature to individual predictions, support error analysis,
and increase clinician trust, thus bridging the gap between performance and
interpretability for real-world clinical use. The concave points feature of the
cell nuclei is found to be the most influential feature positively impacting
the classification task. This insight can be very helpful in improving the
diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer by highlighting the key
characteristics of breast tumor.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MOGRAS数据集，用于在3D场景中生成物理合理的人体抓取动作，并通过基准测试和简单有效的方法改进现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么生成全身动作但缺乏精细抓取能力，要么生成精确抓取动作但忽略3D场景，需要解决在3D场景中生成物理合理的全身抓取动作这一挑战。

Method: 引入MOGRAS大规模数据集，包含预抓取行走动作和最终抓取姿势，并提出简单有效的方法来改进现有方法在场景感知生成中的表现。

Result: 通过大量定量和定性实验验证了数据集的有效性，并展示了所提方法带来的显著改进。

Conclusion: MOGRAS数据集和方法为更真实的人-场景交互铺平了道路。

Abstract: Generating realistic full-body motion interacting with objects is critical
for applications in robotics, virtual reality, and human-computer interaction.
While existing methods can generate full-body motion within 3D scenes, they
often lack the fidelity for fine-grained tasks like object grasping.
Conversely, methods that generate precise grasping motions typically ignore the
surrounding 3D scene. This gap, generating full-body grasping motions that are
physically plausible within a 3D scene, remains a significant challenge. To
address this, we introduce MOGRAS (Human MOtion with GRAsping in 3D Scenes), a
large-scale dataset that bridges this gap. MOGRAS provides pre-grasping
full-body walking motions and final grasping poses within richly annotated 3D
indoor scenes. We leverage MOGRAS to benchmark existing full-body grasping
methods and demonstrate their limitations in scene-aware generation.
Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective method to adapt existing
approaches to work seamlessly within 3D scenes. Through extensive quantitative
and qualitative experiments, we validate the effectiveness of our dataset and
highlight the significant improvements our proposed method achieves, paving the
way for more realistic human-scene interactions.

*Runchu Donga,Peng Zhao,Guiqin Wang,Nan Qi,Jie Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EdgeSync是一种高效的边缘模型更新方法，通过改进样本过滤和动态训练管理，解决实时视频分析中模型精度下降和更新延迟问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时视频分析系统在边缘设备部署轻量模型以减少延迟，但数据特征分布随时间变化（如光照、天气条件变化）会导致模型精度下降。现有方法面临计算密集的重新训练过程导致更新延迟，以及新模型与当前视频流数据分布不匹配的问题。

Method: EdgeSync引入高效的边缘模型更新方法：1）通过结合时效性和推理结果增强样本过滤，确保训练样本与当前视频内容更相关；2）动态训练管理模块优化模型更新的时间和顺序以提高时效性。

Result: 在多样复杂的真实世界数据集上的评估表明，EdgeSync相比现有方法准确率提升约3.4%，相比传统方法提升约10%。

Conclusion: EdgeSync通过改进样本过滤和动态训练管理，有效解决了边缘模型更新中的延迟和精度问题，显著提升了实时视频分析系统的性能。

Abstract: Real-time video analytics systems typically deploy lightweight models on edge
devices to reduce latency. However, the distribution of data features may
change over time due to various factors such as changing lighting and weather
conditions, leading to decreased model accuracy. Recent frameworks try to
address this issue by leveraging remote servers to continuously train and adapt
lightweight edge models using more complex models in the cloud. Despite these
advancements, existing methods face two key challenges: first, the retraining
process is compute-intensive, causing significant delays in model updates;
second, the new model may not align well with the evolving data distribution of
the current video stream. To address these challenges, we introduce EdgeSync,
an efficient edge-model updating approach that enhances sample filtering by
incorporating timeliness and inference results, thus ensuring training samples
are more relevant to the current video content while reducing update delays.
Additionally, EdgeSync features a dynamic training management module that
optimizes the timing and sequencing of model updates to improve their
timeliness. Evaluations on diverse and complex real-world datasets demonstrate
that EdgeSync improves accuracy by approximately 3.4% compared to existing
methods and by about 10% compared to traditional approaches.

Abstract: Physical simulation relies on spatially-varying mechanical properties, often
laboriously hand-crafted. VoMP is a feed-forward method trained to predict
Young's modulus ($E$), Poisson's ratio ($\nu$), and density ($\rho$) throughout
the volume of 3D objects, in any representation that can be rendered and
voxelized. VoMP aggregates per-voxel multi-view features and passes them to our
trained Geometry Transformer to predict per-voxel material latent codes. These
latents reside on a manifold of physically plausible materials, which we learn
from a real-world dataset, guaranteeing the validity of decoded per-voxel
materials. To obtain object-level training data, we propose an annotation
pipeline combining knowledge from segmented 3D datasets, material databases,
and a vision-language model, along with a new benchmark. Experiments show that
VoMP estimates accurate volumetric properties, far outperforming prior art in
accuracy and speed.

*Emmanuel U. Ugwu,Zhang Xinming*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文首次全面评估SAM2变体在火焰分割任务中的表现，发现边界框提示策略优于自动和单点方法，其中Box+MP组合在Khan数据集上获得最高mIoU(0.64)和Dice系数(0.75)。轻量级变体如TinySAM和MobileSAM更适合边缘部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 火焰分割面临火焰边界不规则、边缘半透明和强度变化大的挑战，而SAM系列模型在火焰分割特别是移动部署约束下的有效性尚未充分探索。

Method: 系统评估了四种SAM2.1变体和移动导向变体，使用多种提示策略：自动、单正点、单正点+单负点、多正点、边界框及其混合变体。

Result: 边界框提示策略表现最佳，Box+MP在Khan数据集上达到最高性能。轻量级变体显著降低了内存和计算成本。

Conclusion: 这项工作为在火焰监控系统中部署可提示分割模型提供了关键见解，并为领域特定SAM应用建立了基准。

Abstract: Fire segmentation remains a critical challenge in computer vision due to
flames' irregular boundaries, translucent edges, and highly variable
intensities. While the Segment Anything Models (SAM and SAM2) have demonstrated
impressive cross-domain generalization capabilities, their effectiveness in
fire segmentation -- particularly under mobile deployment constraints --
remains largely unexplored. This paper presents the first comprehensive
evaluation of SAM2 variants for fire segmentation, focusing on bounding box
prompting strategies to enhance deployment feasibility. We systematically
evaluate four SAM2.1 variants (tiny, small, base_plus, large) alongside
mobile-oriented variants (TinySAM, MobileSAM) across three fire datasets using
multiple prompting strategies: automatic, single positive point (SP), single
positive point + single negative point (SP+SN), multiple positive points (MP),
bounding box (Box), and hybrid variants (Box+SP and Box+MP). Our experimental
results demonstrate that bounding box prompts consistently outperform automatic
and single point-based approaches, with Box+MP achieving the highest mean IoU
(0.64) and Dice coefficient (0.75) on the Khan dataset. Lightweight variants
such as TinySAM and MobileSAM further reduce memory and computational costs,
making them more suitable for latency-tolerant edge scenarios. Overall, this
work provides critical insights for deploying promptable segmentation models in
fire monitoring systems and establishes benchmarks for future research in
domain-specific SAM applications. Code is available at:

TL;DR: 提出一种结合扩散模型材质先验与物理渲染的混合重光照框架，通过时间正则化和光学流引导实现稳定的体积视频重光照


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前体积视频重光照方法存在时间稳定性问题，扩散模型在单帧表现良好但在序列中产生随机噪声和不稳定性，视频扩散模型受限于内存和规模

Method: 混合框架结合扩散模型材质先验与时间正则化：聚合多帧随机材质估计为时间一致的着色分量，使用光学流引导正则化；间接效果通过高斯不透明度场提取网格代理，在标准图形管线中渲染

Result: 在真实和合成捕获数据上的实验表明，该方法比纯扩散基线在序列重光照中显著更稳定，且可扩展到视频扩散模型无法处理的更长片段

Conclusion: 混合方法平衡学习先验与物理约束，是实现生产级体积视频重光照的实用步骤

Abstract: Volumetric video relighting is essential for bringing captured performances
into virtual worlds, but current approaches struggle to deliver temporally
stable, production-ready results. Diffusion-based intrinsic decomposition
methods show promise for single frames, yet suffer from stochastic noise and
instability when extended to sequences, while video diffusion models remain
constrained by memory and scale. We propose a hybrid relighting framework that
combines diffusion-derived material priors with temporal regularization and
physically motivated rendering. Our method aggregates multiple stochastic
estimates of per-frame material properties into temporally consistent shading
components, using optical-flow-guided regularization. For indirect effects such
as shadows and reflections, we extract a mesh proxy from Gaussian Opacity
Fields and render it within a standard graphics pipeline. Experiments on real
and synthetic captures show that this hybrid strategy achieves substantially
more stable relighting across sequences than diffusion-only baselines, while
scaling beyond the clip lengths feasible for video diffusion. These results
indicate that hybrid approaches, which balance learned priors with physically
grounded constraints, are a practical step toward production-ready volumetric
video relighting.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对扩散模型的高效成员推理攻击方法，通过注入轻微噪声并分析噪声分布的聚合程度来识别训练数据成员。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型（如Stable Diffusion）的广泛使用带来了隐私风险，特别是成员推理攻击可能泄露训练数据信息。

Method: 基于噪声注入和噪声分布聚合度评估的方法，利用训练集样本和非训练集样本在噪声预测模式上的可区分差异。

Result: 该方法在多个数据集上表现优异，在大规模文本到图像扩散模型中ASR和AUC指标更好，证明了方法的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 提出的成员推理攻击方法高效且可扩展，仅需较少访问目标扩散模型即可实现高性能攻击。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated powerful performance in generating
high-quality images. A typical example is text-to-image generator like Stable
Diffusion. However, their widespread use also poses potential privacy risks. A
key concern is membership inference attacks, which attempt to determine whether
a particular data sample was used in the model training process. We propose an
efficient membership inference attack method against diffusion models. This
method is based on the injection of slight noise and the evaluation of the
aggregation degree of the noise distribution. The intuition is that the noise
prediction patterns of diffusion models for training set samples and
non-training set samples exhibit distinguishable differences.Specifically, we
suppose that member images exhibit higher aggregation of predicted noise around
a certain time step of the diffusion process. In contrast, the predicted noises
of non-member images exhibit a more discrete characteristic around the certain
time step. Compared with other existing methods, our proposed method requires
fewer visits to the target diffusion model. We inject slight noise into the
image under test and then determine its membership by analyzing the aggregation
degree of the noise distribution predicted by the model. Empirical findings
indicate that our method achieves superior performance across multiple
datasets. At the same time, our method can also show better attack effects in
ASR and AUC when facing large-scale text-to-image diffusion models, proving the
scalability of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D/4D生成方法在跨视角语义身份保持方面存在不足，个性化3D/4D生成研究仍不充分

Method: 采用Track-Inpaint-REsplat三阶段方法：视频跟踪识别需修改区域，主题驱动2D修复渐进填充，重投影保持3D一致性

Result: 相比现有最先进方法，显著改善了3D/4D生成中的身份保持效果

Conclusion: TIRE方法有效解决了3D/4D生成中的身份保持问题，为个性化3D/4D生成提供了新思路

Abstract: Current 3D/4D generation methods are usually optimized for photorealism,
efficiency, and aesthetics. However, they often fail to preserve the semantic
identity of the subject across different viewpoints. Adapting generation
methods with one or few images of a specific subject (also known as
Personalization or Subject-driven generation) allows generating visual content
that align with the identity of the subject. However, personalized 3D/4D
generation is still largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce TIRE
(Track, Inpaint, REsplat), a novel method for subject-driven 3D/4D generation.
It takes an initial 3D asset produced by an existing 3D generative model as
input and uses video tracking to identify the regions that need to be modified.
Then, we adopt a subject-driven 2D inpainting model for progressively infilling
the identified regions. Finally, we resplat the modified 2D multi-view
observations back to 3D while still maintaining consistency. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves identity
preservation in 3D/4D generation compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our

TL;DR: 本文提出了AVEP（以动作为中心的视频事件预测）任务，通过构建包含35K标注视频和178K视频片段的大型结构化数据集，并开发基于节点-图层次注意力的EventFormer模型，在视频事件预测任务上超越了现有视频预测模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类事件多以视频形式记录而非脚本，但在视觉领域缺乏相关研究。现有视频预测任务缺乏复杂逻辑和丰富语义信息，需要开发能够理解事件结构的新任务。

Method: 构建大型结构化视频事件数据集，提出EventFormer模型，采用节点-图层次注意力机制，能够捕捉事件与参数之间的关系以及参数间的共指关系。

Result: 在AVEP任务上，EventFormer模型超越了多种最先进的视频预测模型和LVLMs，证明了任务的复杂性和数据集的价值。

Conclusion: AVEP任务和EventFormer模型为视频事件预测提供了新方向，数据集和代码将公开发布以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Script event induction, which aims to predict the subsequent event based on
the context, is a challenging task in NLP, achieving remarkable success in
practical applications. However, human events are mostly recorded and presented
in the form of videos rather than scripts, yet there is a lack of related
research in the realm of vision. To address this problem, we introduce AVEP
(Action-centric Video Event Prediction), a task that distinguishes itself from
existing video prediction tasks through its incorporation of more complex logic
and richer semantic information. We present a large structured dataset, which
consists of about $35K$ annotated videos and more than $178K$ video clips of
event, built upon existing video event datasets to support this task. The
dataset offers more fine-grained annotations, where the atomic unit is
represented as a multimodal event argument node, providing better structured
representations of video events. Due to the complexity of event structures,
traditional visual models that take patches or frames as input are not
well-suited for AVEP. We propose EventFormer, a node-graph hierarchical
attention based video event prediction model, which can capture both the
relationships between events and their arguments and the coreferencial
relationships between arguments. We conducted experiments using several SOTA
video prediction models as well as LVLMs on AVEP, demonstrating both the
complexity of the task and the value of the dataset. Our approach outperforms
all these video prediction models. We will release the dataset and code for
replicating the experiments and annotations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模光纤成像需要测量值与测量矩阵严格匹配才能重建图像，但实际应用中由于系统配置未知或光纤弯曲后难以实时对准，导致传统重建算法失效。

Method: 提出失配方程，设计匹配和校准解决方案算法来构建新的测量矩阵，并在附录中提供了详细的理论证明。

Result: 实验结果表明，在低噪声水平下，构建的矩阵可用于传统重建算法中的匹配对，成功重建原始图像。算法对噪声、计算精度和正交性具有一定鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该理论解决了测量矩阵未知时的图像重建问题，具有实际应用价值，但存在一定局限性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Multimode fiber imaging requires strict matching between measurement value
and measurement matrix to achieve image reconstruction. However, in practical
applications, the measurement matrix often cannot be obtained due to unknown
system configuration or difficulty in real-time alignment after arbitrary fiber
bending, resulting in the failure of traditional reconstruction algorithms.
This paper presents a novel mismatch reconstruction theory for solving the
problem of image reconstruction when measurement matrix is unknown. We first
propose mismatch equation and design matched and calibration solution
algorithms to construct a new measurement matrix. In addition, we also provide
a detailed proof of these equations and algorithms in the appendix. The
experimental results show that under low noise levels, constructed matrix can
be used for matched pair in traditional reconstruction algorithms, and
reconstruct the original image successfully. Then, we analyze the impact of
noise, computational precision and orthogonality on reconstruction performance.
The results show that proposed algorithms have a certain degree of robustness.
Finally, we discuss the limitations and potential applications of this theory.

Abstract: Data fusion is an essential task in various domains, enabling the integration
of multi-source information to enhance data quality and insights. One key
application is in satellite remote sensing, where fusing multi-sensor
observations can improve spatial and temporal resolution. In this study, we
explore the design space of diffusion and flow models for data fusion, focusing
on the integration of Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational
Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite
(VIIRS) nighttime lights data. Our approach leverages a diverse set of 2D
image-to-image generative models, including UNET, diffusion, and flow modeling
architectures. We evaluate the effectiveness of these architectures in
satellite remote sensing data fusion, identifying diffusion models based on
UNet as particularly adept at preserving fine-grained spatial details and
generating high-fidelity fused images. We also provide guidance on the
selection of noise schedulers in diffusion-based models, highlighting the
trade-offs between iterative solvers for faster inference and discrete
schedulers for higher-quality reconstructions. Additionally, we explore
quantization techniques to optimize memory efficiency and computational cost
without compromising performance. Our findings offer practical insights into
selecting the most effective diffusion and flow model architectures for data
fusion tasks, particularly in remote sensing applications, and provide
recommendations for leveraging noise scheduling strategies to enhance fusion
quality.

Conclusion: MAFR为融合视觉和几何信息提供了原则性方法，提升了工业异常检测的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) increasingly benefits from integrating 2D
and 3D data, but robust cross-modal fusion remains challenging. We propose a
novel unsupervised framework, Multi-Modal Attention-Driven Fusion Restoration
(MAFR), which synthesises a unified latent space from RGB images and point
clouds using a shared fusion encoder, followed by attention-guided,
modality-specific decoders. Anomalies are localised by measuring reconstruction
errors between input features and their restored counterparts. Evaluations on
the MVTec 3D-AD and Eyecandies benchmarks demonstrate that MAFR achieves
state-of-the-art results, with a mean I-AUROC of 0.972 and 0.901, respectively.
The framework also exhibits strong performance in few-shot learning settings,
and ablation studies confirm the critical roles of the fusion architecture and
composite loss. MAFR offers a principled approach for fusing visual and
geometric information, advancing the robustness and accuracy of industrial
anomaly detection. Code is available at https://github.com/adabrh/MAFR

TL;DR: TITA是一个轻量级框架，通过冻结基础视觉语言模型并训练奖励模型来近似其分布，在推理时提取隐式偏好信号作为对数概率比，提供token级别的自回归反馈，减少幻觉并提高理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型的输出容易产生与视觉输入不对应的幻觉文本，而现有的对齐方法要么依赖昂贵的带注释偏好数据微调，要么使用仅提供粗略延迟反馈的序列级推理策略。

Method: 提出TITA框架：冻结基础VLM，训练奖励模型近似其分布；推理时提取奖励模型与目标VLM之间的对数概率比作为隐式偏好信号，提供密集的自回归反馈。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-7B和13B上的广泛评估显示，在12个基准测试中持续提升，MMVet提升8.6%，POPE提升6.7%；在Qwen2.5-VL-7B和DeepSeek-VL2-27.5B上也显示出可比的增益，特别是在减少幻觉和提高VQA准确性方面，且推理开销可忽略。

Conclusion: TITA作为推理时直接偏好优化的变体，无需重新训练主干模型即可提供token级校正信号，有效减少幻觉并增强一般理解能力，同时保持轻量级特性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become essential backbones of modern
multimodal intelligence, yet their outputs remain prone to
hallucination-plausible text misaligned with visual inputs. Existing alignment
approaches often rely on expensive fine-tuning with annotated preference data
or sequence-level inference strategies that provide only coarse, delayed
feedback. To overcome these limitations, we present TITA (Token-level
Inference-Time Alignment), a lightweight framework that freezes the base VLM
and instead trains a reward model to approximate its distribution. During
inference, implicit preference signals are extracted as log-probability ratios
between the reward model and the target VLM, yielding dense autoregressive
feedback. This formulation can be viewed as an inference-time variant of Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), providing token-level corrective signals without
retraining the backbone. Extensive evaluations on LLaVA-1.5-7B and 13B show
consistent gains across 12 benchmarks, with improvements of 8.6% on MMVet and
6.7% on POPE, indicating stronger general understanding and reduced
hallucinations. Additional experiments on Qwen2.5-VL-7B and DeepSeek-VL2-27.5B
show comparable gains, especially in hallucination reduction and VQA accuracy,
while incurring negligible inference overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型直接采用跨领域架构，难以有效捕捉时间序列数据固有的多尺度时间依赖关系，特别是在零样本迁移到具有不同模式和采样策略的数据集时表现受限。

Method: 提出HIBA架构，采用分层交错块稀疏注意力机制：块内注意力促进局部信息交换，块间注意力捕捉全局时间模式交互和动态演化。基于此构建了参数规模从950万到15亿的Xihe模型系列。

Result: 在GIFT-Eval基准测试中，最小的Xihe-tiny模型（950万参数）超越多数现有TSFMs，展现了卓越的参数效率；最大的Xihe-max模型（15亿参数）在零样本性能上创造了新的最佳记录，显著超越先前最优结果。

Conclusion: HIBA架构在整个参数规模范围内都表现出色，证明了其卓越的泛化能力和架构优越性，为时间序列基础模型的发展提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of time series foundation models (TSFMs) has been
propelled by migrating architectures from language models. While existing TSFMs
demonstrate impressive performance, their direct adoption of cross-domain
architectures constrains effective capture of multiscale temporal dependencies
inherent to time series data. This limitation becomes particularly pronounced
during zero-shot transfer across datasets with divergent underlying patterns
and sampling strategies. To address these challenges, we propose Hierarchical
Interleaved Block Attention (HIBA) which employs hierarchical inter- and
intra-block sparse attention to effectively capture multi-scale dependencies.
Intra-block attention facilitates local information exchange, and inter-block
attention operates across blocks to capture global temporal pattern interaction
and dynamic evolution. Leveraging the HIBA architecture, we introduce Xihe, a
scalable TSFM family spanning from an ultra-efficient 9.5M parameter
configuration to high-capacity 1.5B variant. Evaluated on the comprehensive
GIFT-Eval benchmark, our most compact Xihe-tiny model (9.5M) surpasses the
majority of contemporary TSFMs, demonstrating remarkable parameter efficiency.
More impressively, Xihe-max (1.5B) establishes new state-of-the-art zero-shot
performance, surpassing previous best results by a substantial margin. This
consistent performance excellence across the entire parameter spectrum provides
compelling evidence for the exceptional generalization capabilities and
architectural superiority of HIBA.

integrating automatic capabilities to ease the task for annotators and assess
their performance. The research delves into the practical implications of the
annotation processes, the integration of AI components, and the evaluation of
its outcomes. We analyze their impact on efficiency, accuracy, and overall
annotation quality. Focusing on the Human-in-the-Loop for video annotation
tasks, we implemented a single-iteration scheme using Label Studio and
AI-powered zero-shot pre-annotations. Using this framework, we designed a test
based on the annotation of the UCF-Crime dataset to discriminate between normal
and abnormal activities in video footage. Our results evidence how automatic
AI-based pre-annotation can streamline the video annotation workflow,
empowering human annotators and optimizing the overall pipeline. Using the
pre-annotated data, we observed a 35% reduction in the annotation time for 70%
of the annotators with similar quality annotations, compared to the traditional
manual annotation task. Results are consistent with asset duration and
complexity. We also observed that while annotators rapidly learned to use the
tool, the produced annotations are more coherent among annotators and better
match the natural clustering of the video frames.

Abstract: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) diagnosis from radiographs remains challenging due
to the subtle morphological details that standard deep learning models struggle
to capture effectively. We propose a novel multimodal framework that combines
anatomical structure with radiographic features by integrating a morphological
graph representation - derived from Segment Anything Model (SAM) segmentations
- with a vision encoder. Our approach enforces alignment between
geometry-informed graph embeddings and radiographic features through mutual
information maximization, significantly improving KOA classification accuracy.
By constructing graphs from anatomical features, we introduce explicit
morphological priors that mirror clinical assessment criteria, enriching the
feature space and enhancing the model's inductive bias. Experiments on the
Osteoarthritis Initiative dataset demonstrate that our approach surpasses
single-modality baselines by up to 10\% in accuracy (reaching nearly 80\%),
while outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods by 8\% in accuracy and
11\% in F1 score. These results underscore the critical importance of
incorporating anatomical structure into radiographic analysis for accurate KOA
severity grading.

TL;DR: 提出一种使用两个并行采样器在有限去噪步骤下提升扩散模型采样质量的方法，通过适当整合连续时间步的信息来改善图像生成效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在有限去噪步骤（即扩散模型评估次数受限）的情况下，如何提高采样图像的质量。

Method: 使用两个并行采样器在连续时间步进行去噪，并适当整合它们的信息到潜在图像中。方法简单易实现，无需额外微调或外部模型。

Result: 通过自动化和人工评估验证了该方法对不同扩散模型的有效性，发现朴素的信息整合会降低采样质量，且增加更多并行采样器不一定能进一步提升质量。

Conclusion: 在有限去噪步骤下，两个并行采样器的适当信息整合可以有效提升扩散模型的采样质量，但需要精心设计整合策略。

Abstract: We consider the situation where we have a limited number of denoising steps,
i.e., of evaluations of a diffusion model. We show that two parallel processors
or samplers under such limitation can improve the quality of the sampled image.
Particularly, the two samplers make denoising steps at successive times, and
their information is appropriately integrated in the latent image. Remarkably,
our method is simple both conceptually and to implement: it is plug-&-play,
model agnostic, and does not require any additional fine-tuning or external
models. We test our method with both automated and human evaluations for
different diffusion models. We also show that a naive integration of the
information from the two samplers lowers sample quality. Finally, we find that
adding more parallel samplers does not necessarily improve sample quality.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of video data, text-video retrieval technology has
become increasingly important in numerous application scenarios such as
recommendation and search. Early text-video retrieval methods suffer from two
critical drawbacks: first, they heavily rely on large-scale annotated
video-text pairs, leading to high data acquisition costs; second, there is a
significant modal gap between video and text features, which limits cross-modal
alignment accuracy. With the development of vision-language model, adapting
CLIP to video tasks has attracted great attention. However, existing adaptation
methods generally lack enhancement for dynamic video features and fail to
effectively suppress static redundant features. To address this issue, this
paper proposes FDA-CLIP (Frame Difference Alpha-CLIP), which is a concise
CLIP-based training framework for text-video alignment. Specifically, the
method uses frame differences to generate dynamic region masks, which are input
into Alpha-CLIP as an additional Alpha channel. This proactively guides the
model to focus on semantically critical dynamic regions while suppressing
static background redundancy. Experiments demonstrate that frame
difference-guided video semantic encoding can effectively balance retrieval
efficiency and accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的微调任务MPCC，通过重构被遮挡图像中的语义内容来增强多模态模型的视觉上下文和常识推理能力，并开发了RFPS训练方法提升模型的泛化推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理模型主要关注单模态语言任务，在多模态场景特别是视觉语言任务中存在适应不足的问题，无法充分利用视觉上下文和常识知识，限制了跨多模态环境的推理泛化能力。

Method: 引入MPCC微调任务，通过遮挡图像内容让模型进行语义重构；开发RFPS训练方法；建立MPCC Eval评估基准；采用多种微调策略指导推理。

Result: 该方法有效提升了模型在多模态环境中的推理能力，特别是在OOD和跨任务场景下表现出更好的泛化性能。

Conclusion: MPCC任务和RFPS方法为多模态模型的通用推理能力提供了有效解决方案，能够更好地整合视觉上下文和常识推理，促进跨多模态环境的推理泛化。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in reasoning models have markedly advanced the reasoning
capabilities of large language models, particularly via training on tasks with
verifiable rewards. Yet, a significant gap persists in their adaptation to real
world multimodal scenarios, most notably, vision language tasks, due to a heavy
focus on single modal language settings. While efforts to transplant
reinforcement learning techniques from NLP to VLMs have emerged, these
approaches often remain confined to perception centric tasks or reduce images
to textual summaries, failing to fully exploit visual context and commonsense
knowledge, ultimately constraining the generalization of reasoning capabilities
across diverse multimodal environments. To address this limitation, we
introduce a novel fine tuning task, Masked Prediction via Context and
Commonsense, which forces models to integrate visual context and commonsense
reasoning by reconstructing semantically meaningful content from occluded
images, thereby laying the foundation for generalized reasoning. To
systematically evaluate the model performance in generalized reasoning, we
developed a specialized evaluation benchmark, MPCC Eval, and employed various
fine tuning strategies to guide reasoning. Among these, we introduced an
innovative training method, Reinforcement Fine tuning with Prior Sampling,
which not only enhances model performance but also improves its generalized
reasoning capabilities in OOD and cross task scenarios.

### [30] [Semantic Relation-Enhanced CLIP Adapter for Domain Adaptive Zero-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21808)
*Jiaao Yu,Mingjie Han,Jinkun Jiang,Junyu Dong,Tao Gong,Man Lan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了SRE-CLIP适配器框架，通过语义关系结构损失和跨模态对齐保持策略，解决了DAZSL中跨类别知识转移效率低和跨模态对齐退化的问题，在I2AwA和I2WebV基准上实现了最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有范式无法平衡跨域迁移和跨类别泛化，催生了领域自适应零样本学习的需求。虽然CLIP模型在DAZSL领域具有先天优势，但当前研究未能充分利用其潜力。

Method: 提出语义关系增强的CLIP适配器框架，包含语义关系结构损失和跨模态对齐保持策略，以解决跨类别知识转移效率低和跨模态对齐退化的问题。

Result: 在I2AwA和I2WebV基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SRE-CLIP是首个基于CLIP的DAZSL方法，有效解决了该领域的关键挑战，为数据受限场景下的深度学习模型训练提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The high cost of data annotation has spurred research on training deep
learning models in data-limited scenarios. Existing paradigms, however, fail to
balance cross-domain transfer and cross-category generalization, giving rise to
the demand for Domain-Adaptive Zero-Shot Learning (DAZSL). Although
vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have inherent advantages in the DAZSL
field, current studies do not fully exploit their potential. Applying CLIP to
DAZSL faces two core challenges: inefficient cross-category knowledge transfer
due to the lack of semantic relation guidance, and degraded cross-modal
alignment during target domain fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose
a Semantic Relation-Enhanced CLIP (SRE-CLIP) Adapter framework, integrating a
Semantic Relation Structure Loss and a Cross-Modal Alignment Retention
Strategy. As the first CLIP-based DAZSL method, SRE-CLIP achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the I2AwA and I2WebV benchmarks, significantly
outperforming existing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人导航系统决策过程黑箱化问题，在保持高性能的同时实现决策可解释性，克服传统可解释系统性能不足的缺陷

Method: 将动作描述作为强化学习的辅助任务，利用预训练视觉语言模型进行知识蒸馏，解决缺乏真实标注数据的问题

Conclusion: 通过将语言描述作为辅助任务融入强化学习，成功实现了高性能与可解释性的平衡，为可靠机器人导航系统提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: The field of multimodal robot navigation in indoor environments has garnered
significant attention in recent years. However, as tasks and methods become
more advanced, the action decision systems tend to become more complex and
operate as black-boxes. For a reliable system, the ability to explain or
describe its decisions is crucial; however, there tends to be a trade-off in
that explainable systems can not outperform non-explainable systems in terms of
performance. In this paper, we propose incorporating the task of describing
actions in language into the reinforcement learning of navigation as an
auxiliary task. Existing studies have found it difficult to incorporate
describing actions into reinforcement learning due to the absence of
ground-truth data. We address this issue by leveraging knowledge distillation
from pre-trained description generation models, such as vision-language models.
We comprehensively evaluate our approach across various navigation tasks,
demonstrating that it can describe actions while attaining high navigation
performance. Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art performance in the
particularly challenging multimodal navigation task of semantic audio-visual
navigation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合传统特征提取和深度学习的混合诊断框架，用于改进糖尿病视网膜病变检测，通过融合可解释的临床数据和深度学习特征，提高早期诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 糖尿病视网膜病变是糖尿病的主要并发症，在印度等糖尿病高发地区尤为严重。早期筛查至关重要，因为该病在初期无症状，但可能导致不可逆的视力丧失。

Method: 采用混合诊断框架，结合传统手工特征提取（捕捉关键临床标记）和深度学习（自动化分层模式识别），将可解释的临床数据与学习特征相融合。

Result: 该模型在分类性能上优于单独的深度学习方法，减少了假阴性，实现了更准确的糖尿病视网膜病变筛查。

Conclusion: 这种多模态AI驱动方法能够实现可扩展、准确的糖尿病视网膜病变筛查，对糖尿病负担重的地区至关重要。

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), a vision-threatening complication of Dia-betes
Mellitus (DM), is a major global concern, particularly in India, which has one
of the highest diabetic populations. Prolonged hyperglycemia damages reti-nal
microvasculature, leading to DR symptoms like microaneurysms, hemor-rhages, and
fluid leakage, which, if undetected, cause irreversible vision loss. Therefore,
early screening is crucial as DR is asymptomatic in its initial stages. Fundus
imaging aids precise diagnosis by detecting subtle retinal lesions. This paper
introduces a hybrid diagnostic framework combining traditional feature
extraction and deep learning (DL) to enhance DR detection. While handcrafted
features capture key clinical markers, DL automates hierarchical pattern
recog-nition, improving early diagnosis. The model synergizes interpretable
clinical data with learned features, surpassing standalone DL approaches that
demon-strate superior classification and reduce false negatives. This
multimodal AI-driven approach enables scalable, accurate DR screening, crucial
for diabetes-burdened regions.

algorithms, YOLOv11, RetinaNet, Fast R-CNN, YOLOv8, RT-DETR, and DETR, on the
NEU-DET surface defect detection dataset, comprising images representing
various metal surface defects, a crucial application in industrial quality
control. Each model's performance was assessed regarding detection accuracy,

inclusions, and rolled-in scales. YOLOv11, a state-of-the-art real-time object
detection algorithm, demonstrated superior performance compared to the other
methods, achieving a remarkable 70% higher accuracy on average. This
improvement can be attributed to YOLOv11s enhanced feature extraction
capabilities and ability to process the entire image in a single forward pass,
making it faster and more efficient in detecting minor surface defects.
Additionally, YOLOv11's architecture optimizations, such as improved anchor box
generation and deeper convolutional layers, contributed to more precise
localization of defects. In conclusion, YOLOv11's outstanding performance in
accuracy and speed solidifies its position as the most effective model for
surface defect detection on the NEU dataset, surpassing competing algorithms by
a substantial margin.

*Samuel J. Barrett,Docko Sow*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SITS-DECO是一个基于GPT风格解码器架构的生成式地球观测基础模型，通过统一序列框架处理多任务EO数据，在作物分类任务上优于更大的EO基础模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有EO基础模型需要额外适配、结构僵化的问题，借鉴大语言模型的统一序列预测方法，简化EO数据的使用。

Method: 采用GPT风格解码器架构，通过符号提示实现多任务处理，利用密集时间序列建模，无需任务或模态特定适配。

Result: 在PASTIS-R作物类型分类任务上优于更大的EO基础模型，证明了密集时间序列建模的重要性。

Conclusion: 展示了数据为中心的建模范式，能力源于训练数据的多样性和结构而非架构复杂性，为未来生成式EO基础模型提供了概念桥梁。

Abstract: Earth Observation (EO) Foundation Modelling (FM) holds great promise for
simplifying and improving the use of EO data for diverse real-world tasks.
However, most existing models require additional adaptation before they can be
used and are structured rigidly around particular data sources or training
approaches. To address this, we take inspiration from large language models,
where diverse tasks, both pre-training and downstream, are implicitly captured
through next-token prediction over unified token sequences, leveraging the
structure and diversity of the training data.
  We introduce SITS-DECO (Satellite Image Time Series-DECoder Only), a
proof-of-concept generative model that applies this unified-sequence framing to
EO data. Using a simple GPT-style decoder-only architecture, and demonstrate
its ability to perform useful EO tasks (pixel-wise, multi-temporal, multi-modal
crop-type classification) in a purely generative framework. Through symbolic
prompting, we show that the model can perform multiple supervised and
self-supervised tasks within a single unified architecture, without task- or
modality-specific adaptation. Despite its simplicity and lack of spatial
context, SITS-DECO outperforms much larger EO foundation models on crop-type
classification (PASTIS-R) demonstrating that dense temporal sequence modelling
is a critical missing ingredient in the current paradigm.
  This work exemplifies a data-centric modelling paradigm in which capability
arises from the diversity and structure of the training data rather than from
architectural complexity. SITS-DECO provides a lightweight, practical route to
multi-modal, multi-task EO modelling, and a conceptual bridge toward future
generative EO foundation models.

TL;DR: Gestura是一个端到端的自由手势理解系统，通过预训练大视觉语言模型、地标处理模块和链式思维推理策略，显著提升了自由手势识别的准确性和响应速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解决方案GestureGPT在手势识别准确性和响应时间方面存在局限，需要开发更高效的自由手势理解系统。

Method: 使用预训练大视觉语言模型对齐手势与语义概念；引入地标处理模块嵌入解剖学手部先验知识；采用链式思维推理策略进行逐步语义推断。

Result: Gestura实现了稳健且适应性强的自由手势理解，并开发了首个包含30万标注问答对的开源自由手势意图推理数据集。

Conclusion: Gestura通过结合LVLM、解剖学先验知识和链式推理，显著提升了自由手势理解的性能，为自然的人机交互提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Free-form gesture understanding is highly appealing for human-computer
interaction, as it liberates users from the constraints of predefined gesture
categories. However, the sole existing solution GestureGPT suffers from limited
recognition accuracy and slow response times. In this paper, we propose
Gestura, an end-to-end system for free-form gesture understanding. Gestura
harnesses a pre-trained Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) to align the highly
dynamic and diverse patterns of free-form gestures with high-level semantic
concepts. To better capture subtle hand movements across different styles, we
introduce a Landmark Processing Module that compensate for LVLMs' lack of
fine-grained domain knowledge by embedding anatomical hand priors. Further, a
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning strategy enables step-by-step semantic
inference, transforming shallow knowledge into deep semantic understanding and
significantly enhancing the model's ability to interpret ambiguous or
unconventional gestures. Together, these components allow Gestura to achieve
robust and adaptable free-form gesture comprehension. Additionally, we have
developed the first open-source dataset for free-form gesture intention
reasoning and understanding with over 300,000 annotated QA pairs.

Motivation: 评估文本到图像生成系统在将提示词中明确指定的属性准确转换为图像时的保真度，这对检测模型偏见和进行模型评估具有重要意义。

Method: 使用两个公共数据集（共430张图像），分析200张文化创意产业女性工作者和230张博物馆策展人的可视化图像，评估个人属性（年龄、头发）、外观（着装、眼镜）和随身物品（姓名标签、剪贴板）的渲染准确性。

Result: DALL-E3在15.6%的属性（共710个）中偏离了提示词规范。随身物品的错误率最低，个人外观错误率中等，人物自身描绘（特别是年龄）的错误率最高。

Conclusion: 研究证明了文本到图像生成系统存在可测量的提示词到图像保真度差距，这对偏见检测和模型评估具有重要影响。

Abstract: This study examines the prompt fidelity of ChatGPT4o / DALL-E3 text-to-image
visualisations by analysing whether attributes explicitly specified in
autogenously generated prompts are correctly rendered in the resulting images.
Using two public-domain datasets comprising 200 visualisations of women working
in the cultural and creative industries and 230 visualisations of museum
curators, the study assessed accuracy across personal attributes (age, hair),
appearance (attire, glasses), and paraphernalia (name tags, clipboards). While
correctly rendered in most cases, DALL-E3 deviated from prompt specifications
in 15.6% of all attributes (n=710). Errors were lowest for paraphernalia,
moderate for personal appearance, and highest for depictions of the person
themselves, particularly age. These findings demonstrate measurable
prompt-to-image fidelity gaps with implications for bias detection and model
evaluation.

TL;DR: 提出基于小波变换和ResNet50的GAN图像检测方法，通过Haar和Daubechies小波滤波器预处理图像，在频域中识别GAN生成图像的独特伪影，检测准确率显著高于空间域方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GAN生成图像的检测已成为数字图像取证的重要挑战，需要开发有效方法来区分真实图像和GAN生成图像。

Method: 使用离散小波变换(DWT)预处理，应用Haar和Daubechies小波滤波器将图像转换为多分辨率表示，然后输入ResNet50网络进行分类。

Result: Haar和Daubechies预处理模型的准确率分别为93.8%和95.1%，显著高于空间域模型的81.5%。Daubechies方法表现最佳。

Conclusion: GAN生成图像在小波域具有独特的伪影或"指纹"，小波域分析是检测GAN图像的有效方法，为未来深度伪造检测系统开发提供了潜力。

Abstract: Identifying images generated by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) has
become a significant challenge in digital image forensics. This research
presents a wavelet-based detection method that uses discrete wavelet transform
(DWT) preprocessing and a ResNet50 classification layer to differentiate the
StyleGAN-generated images from real ones. Haar and Daubechies wavelet filters
are applied to convert the input images into multi-resolution representations,
which will then be fed to a ResNet50 network for classification, capitalizing
on subtle artifacts left by the generative process. Moreover, the wavelet-based
models are compared to an identical ResNet50 model trained on spatial data. The
Haar and Daubechies preprocessed models achieved a greater accuracy of 93.8
percent and 95.1 percent, much higher than the model developed in the spatial
domain (accuracy rate of 81.5 percent). The Daubechies-based model outperforms
Haar, showing that adding layers of descriptive frequency patterns can lead to
even greater distinguishing power. These results indicate that the
GAN-generated images have unique wavelet-domain artifacts or "fingerprints."
The method proposed illustrates the effectiveness of wavelet-domain analysis to
detect GAN images and emphasizes the potential of further developing the
capabilities of future deepfake detection systems.

Conclusion: 结合深度学习和可解释AI为开发可靠、可解释且临床有用的诊断工具提供了有前景的路径。

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) holds enormous potential for improving medical imaging
diagnostics, yet the lack of interpretability in most models hampers clinical
trust and adoption. This paper presents an explainable deep learning framework
for detecting brain tumors in MRI scans and pneumonia in chest X-ray images
using two leading Convolutional Neural Networks, ResNet50 and DenseNet121.
These models were trained on publicly available Kaggle datasets comprising
7,023 brain MRI images and 5,863 chest X-ray images, achieving high
classification performance. DenseNet121 consistently outperformed ResNet50 with
94.3 percent vs. 92.5 percent accuracy for brain tumors and 89.1 percent vs.
84.4 percent accuracy for pneumonia. For better explainability,
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was integrated to create
heatmap visualizations superimposed on the test images, indicating the most
influential image regions in the decision-making process. Interestingly, while
both models produced accurate results, Grad-CAM showed that DenseNet121
consistently focused on core pathological regions, whereas ResNet50 sometimes
scattered attention to peripheral or non-pathological areas. Combining deep
learning and explainable AI offers a promising path toward reliable,
interpretable, and clinically useful diagnostic tools.

Abstract: In the last decade, due to high resolution cameras and accurate meta-phase
analyzes, the accuracy of chromosome classification has improved substantially.
However, current Karyotyping systems demand large number of high quality train
data to have an adequately plausible Precision per each chromosome. Such
provision of high quality train data with accurate devices are not yet
accomplished in some out-reached pathological laboratories. To prevent false
positive detections in low-cost systems and low-quality images settings, this
paper improves the classification Precision of chromosomes using proposed
reliability thresholding metrics and deliberately engineered features. The
proposed method has been evaluated using a variation of deep Alex-Net neural
network, SVM, K Nearest-Neighbors, and their cascade pipelines to an automated
filtering of semi-straight chromosome. The classification results have highly
improved over 90% for the chromosomes with more common defections and
translocations. Furthermore, a comparative analysis over the proposed
thresholding metrics has been conducted and the best metric is bolded with its
salient characteristics. The high Precision results provided for a very
low-quality G-banding database verifies suitability of the proposed metrics and
pruning method for Karyotyping facilities in poor countries and lowbudget
pathological laboratories.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning with abstractive information from the visual
modality presents significant challenges for current multi-modal large language
models (MLLMs). Among the various forms of abstractive information, Multi-Modal
Relational Knowledge (MMRK), which represents abstract relational structures
between multi-modal entities using node-edge formats, remains largely
under-explored. In particular, STructured and Abstractive Reasoning (STAR) on
such data has received little attention from the research community. To bridge
the dual gaps in large-scale high-quality data and capability enhancement
methodologies, this paper makes the following key contributions: (i). An
automatic STAR data engine capable of synthesizing images with MMRK to build
multi-modal instruction data with reliable chain-of-thought thinking for
various STAR tasks and (ii). A comprehsive two-stage capability enhancement
training framework, accompanied by a suite of evaluation protocols tailored to
different STAR tasks. Based upon these contributions, we introduce STAR-64K, a
dataset comprising 64K high-quality multi-modal instruction samples, and
conduct experiments across 5 open-source MLLMs. Experimental results show that
our two-stage enhancement framework enables smaller 3B/7B models to
significantly outperform GPT-4o in STAR. Additionally, we provide in-depth
analysis regarding the effectiveness of various designs, data transferability,
and scalability.

Conclusion: 所提框架能有效处理多模态医疗数据中的模态缺失问题，通过分布对齐和轻量级Transformer设计，在不完整和完整模态场景下均表现出色。

Abstract: In recent years, multimodal medical data-based survival analysis has
attracted much attention. However, real-world datasets often suffer from the
problem of incomplete modality, where some patient modality information is
missing due to acquisition limitations or system failures. Existing methods
typically infer missing modalities directly from observed ones using deep
neural networks, but they often ignore the distributional discrepancy across
modalities, resulting in inconsistent and unreliable modality reconstruction.
To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that combines a
low-rank Transformer with a flow-based generative model for robust and flexible
multimodal survival prediction. Specifically, we first formulate the concerned
problem as incomplete multimodal survival analysis using the multi-instance
representation of whole slide images (WSIs) and genomic profiles. To realize
incomplete multimodal survival analysis, we propose a class-specific flow for
cross-modal distribution alignment. Under the condition of class labels, we
model and transform the cross-modal distribution. By virtue of the reversible
structure and accurate density modeling capabilities of the normalizing flow
model, the model can effectively construct a distribution-consistent latent
space of the missing modality, thereby improving the consistency between the
reconstructed data and the true distribution. Finally, we design a lightweight
Transformer architecture to model intra-modal dependencies while alleviating
the overfitting problem in high-dimensional modality fusion by virtue of the
low-rank Transformer. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our method
not only achieves state-of-the-art performance under complete modality
settings, but also maintains robust and superior accuracy under the incomplete
modalities scenario.

### [42] [Towards Accurate and Efficient Waste Image Classification: A Hybrid Deep Learning and Machine Learning Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21833)
*Ngoc-Bao-Quang Nguyen,Tuan-Minh Do,Cong-Tam Phan,Thi-Thu-Hong Phan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究比较了三种垃圾图像分类方法：传统机器学习、深度学习以及混合方法，发现混合方法在三个公开数据集上表现最佳，准确率高达100%，同时通过特征选择将特征维度减少95%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于图像的自动化垃圾分类是全球废物管理的关键组成部分，但目前缺乏整合机器学习、深度学习和高效混合解决方案的系统性基准测试。

Method: 比较了三种范式：(1)使用手工特征的机器学习算法；(2)深度学习架构（ResNet变体和EfficientNetV2S）；(3)混合方法（使用深度模型进行特征提取，结合传统分类器如支持向量机和逻辑回归）。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的实验表明，混合方法始终优于其他方法，在TrashNet和精炼的家庭垃圾数据集上达到100%准确率，在垃圾分类数据集上达到99.87%准确率，超越了现有最佳基准。特征选择将特征维度减少超过95%而不影响准确率。

Conclusion: 这项工作为废物分类建立了更可靠的基准，并引入了一种高效的混合框架，在保持高精度的同时降低了推理成本，适合在资源受限环境中进行可扩展部署。

Abstract: Automated image-based garbage classification is a critical component of
global waste management; however, systematic benchmarks that integrate Machine
Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and efficient hybrid solutions remain
underdeveloped. This study provides a comprehensive comparison of three
paradigms: (1) machine learning algorithms using handcrafted features, (2) deep
learning architectures, including ResNet variants and EfficientNetV2S, and (3)
a hybrid approach that utilizes deep models for feature extraction combined
with classical classifiers such as Support Vector Machine and Logistic
Regression to identify the most effective strategy. Experiments on three public
datasets - TrashNet, Garbage Classification, and a refined Household Garbage
Dataset (with 43 corrected mislabels)- demonstrate that the hybrid method
consistently outperforms the others, achieving up to 100% accuracy on TrashNet
and the refined Household set, and 99.87% on Garbage Classification, thereby
surpassing state-of-the-art benchmarks. Furthermore, feature selection reduces
feature dimensionality by over 95% without compromising accuracy, resulting in
faster training and inference. This work establishes more reliable benchmarks
for waste classification and introduces an efficient hybrid framework that
achieves high accuracy while reducing inference cost, making it suitable for
scalable deployment in resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: 评估GPT-4o在零样本设置下对胸部X光片进行NORMAL/PNEUMONIA分类的能力，发现简洁的特征导向提示能达到74%准确率，而推理导向提示效果较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索GPT-4o在医学图像解释方面的潜力，特别是在零样本设置下对胸部X光片进行分类的能力。

Method: 使用平衡测试集（400张图像，每类200张），在四种不同提示设计下评估GPT-4o的性能，从最小指令到详细推理提示。

Result: 简洁的特征导向提示达到最高分类准确率74%，而推理导向提示性能较低。

Conclusion: ChatGPT在医学图像解释方面显示出潜在能力，但诊断可靠性仍然有限，需要进一步改进视觉推理和领域适应才能安全应用于临床实践。

Abstract: In this study, we evaluate the ability of OpenAI's gpt-4o model to classify
chest X-ray images as either NORMAL or PNEUMONIA in a zero-shot setting,
without any prior fine-tuning. A balanced test set of 400 images (200 from each
class) was used to assess performance across four distinct prompt designs,
ranging from minimal instructions to detailed, reasoning-based prompts. The
results indicate that concise, feature-focused prompts achieved the highest
classification accuracy of 74\%, whereas reasoning-oriented prompts resulted in
lower performance. These findings highlight that while ChatGPT exhibits
emerging potential for medical image interpretation, its diagnostic reliability
remains limited. Continued advances in visual reasoning and domain-specific
adaptation are required before such models can be safely applied in clinical
practice.

TL;DR: RatioWaveNet通过可训练的有理小波变换前端增强TCFormer主干网络，在BCI运动想象任务中显著提升了最难被试者的解码准确率，同时保持计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于运动想象的脑机接口在非侵入式EEG信号中面临的非平稳性、低信噪比和个体差异等挑战，特别是在最难被试者上的可靠性问题。

Method: 使用有理小波变换前端进行多分辨率子带分解，保持时间长度和位移不变性；结合多核CNN提取局部时空特征，分组查询注意力编码器处理长程上下文，紧凑TCN头进行因果时间整合。

Result: 在BCI-IV-2a和BCI-IV-2b数据集上，相比Transformer主干网络，最差被试者准确率分别提升+0.17/+0.42和+1.07/+2.54个百分点，平均性能也有稳定提升，计算开销适中。

Conclusion: 可训练的小波前端是增强基于Transformer的脑机接口的有效插件，能在不牺牲效率的情况下提高最坏情况下的可靠性。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) based on motor imagery (MI) translate covert
movement intentions into actionable commands, yet reliable decoding from
non-invasive EEG remains challenging due to nonstationarity, low SNR, and
subject variability. We present RatioWaveNet, which augments a strong temporal
CNN-Transformer backbone (TCFormer) with a trainable, Rationally-Dilated
Wavelet Transform (RDWT) front end. The RDWT performs an undecimated,
multi-resolution subband decomposition that preserves temporal length and
shift-invariance, enhancing sensorimotor rhythms while mitigating jitter and
mild artifacts; subbands are fused via lightweight grouped 1-D convolutions and
passed to a multi-kernel CNN for local temporal-spatial feature extraction, a
grouped-query attention encoder for long-range context, and a compact TCN head
for causal temporal integration.
  Our goal is to test whether this principled wavelet front end improves
robustness precisely where BCIs typically fail - on the hardest subjects - and
whether such gains persist on average across seeds under both intra- and
inter-subject protocols. On BCI-IV-2a and BCI-IV-2b, across five seeds,
RatioWaveNet improves worst-subject accuracy over the Transformer backbone by
+0.17 / +0.42 percentage points (Sub-Dependent / LOSO) on 2a and by +1.07 /
+2.54 percentage points on 2b, with consistent average-case gains and modest
computational overhead. These results indicate that a simple, trainable wavelet
front end is an effective plug-in to strengthen Transformer-based BCIs,
improving worst-case reliability without sacrificing efficiency.

TL;DR: 论文揭示了模态失语症现象：统一多模态模型能准确记忆视觉概念但无法用文字表达，尽管同时训练了图像和文本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究当前统一多模态模型中存在的系统性分离问题，即模型在视觉模态表现良好但在文本模态表现不佳，这可能对AI安全框架造成风险。

Method: 通过受控实验在合成数据集上测试多种架构，验证模态失语症现象，并展示仅对文本进行对齐的模型仍能生成不安全图像。

Result: 前沿模型能近乎完美地重现标志性电影艺术作品，但在文字描述中混淆关键细节；模态失语症是当前统一多模态模型的基本属性而非训练伪影。

Conclusion: 模态失语症是当前多模态模型的固有缺陷，可能导致AI安全漏洞，因为单一模态的安全防护无法阻止有害概念在其他模态中的传播。

Abstract: We present modal aphasia, a systematic dissociation in which current unified
multimodal models accurately memorize concepts visually but fail to articulate
them in writing, despite being trained on images and text simultaneously. For
one, we show that leading frontier models can generate near-perfect
reproductions of iconic movie artwork, but confuse crucial details when asked
for textual descriptions. We corroborate those findings through controlled
experiments on synthetic datasets in multiple architectures. Our experiments
confirm that modal aphasia reliably emerges as a fundamental property of
current unified multimodal models, not just as a training artifact. In
practice, modal aphasia can introduce vulnerabilities in AI safety frameworks,
as safeguards applied to one modality may leave harmful concepts accessible in
other modalities. We demonstrate this risk by showing how a model aligned
solely on text remains capable of generating unsafe images.

TL;DR: SCoPE VLM是一个文档导航专家模型，通过链式滚动机制选择性导航文档，专注于相关片段，大幅降低内存使用并模拟人类阅读行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型在长上下文视觉信息理解方面的挑战，特别是在GUI控制和网页导航等代理任务中，现有方法内存消耗大且不实用。

Method: 提出链式滚动机制选择性递归导航文档，引入专用数据生成管道构建信息丰富的链式滚动轨迹，以及专门的强化学习方法Episodic Group Relative Policy Optimization。

Result: 方法显著减少内存使用，有效模拟人类阅读行为，是首个在多页文档问答中明确建模代理阅读模式的框架。

Conclusion: SCoPE VLM推进了多模态代理的能力，为长上下文视觉信息理解提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding long-context visual information remains a fundamental challenge
for vision-language models, particularly in agentic tasks such as GUI control
and web navigation. While web pages and GUI environments are inherently
structured documents, current VLMs typically neglect decision-oriented document
understanding in their training objectives. Existing approaches primarily
extend visual embeddings to process long, high-resolution inputs, but these
methods are memory-intensive and impractical for locally deployable solutions.
To address these issues, we propose SCoPE VLM, a document navigation expert
that leverages a novel Chain of Scroll mechanism to selectively and recursively
navigate documents, focusing exclusively on relevant segments. We introduce a
dedicated data generation pipeline to construct informative Chain of Scroll
trajectories and Episodic Group Relative Policy Optimization, a tailored
reinforcement learning method to reduce the gap between training and inference.
Our method substantially reduces memory usage and effectively models human-like
reading behaviors. To the best of our knowledge, SCoPE VLM is the first
framework to explicitly model agentic reading patterns in multi-page document
question answering, advancing the capabilities of multimodal agents.

*Anthony Zhang,Mahmut Gokmen,Dennis Hein,Rongjun Ge,Wenjun Xia,Ge Wang,Jin Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Poisson Flow一致性训练（PFCT）方法，使Poisson Flow一致性模型（PFCM）能够独立训练，无需依赖预训练的PFGM++模型，并在低剂量CT图像去噪任务中取得良好效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PFCM原本只能通过蒸馏方式训练，这限制了其在多种数据模态中的应用潜力。研究目标是开发一种独立的PFCM训练方法。

Method: 利用扰动核移除对预训练PFGM++的依赖，引入正弦离散化调度和Beta噪声分布以提高适应性和样本质量。

Result: 在低剂量CT图像去噪任务中，模型在LPIPS和SSIM指标上改善了图像质量，去噪效果与一致性模型等其他模型相当。

Conclusion: PFCT被证明是训练PFCM的有效方法，在生成建模领域为PFCM的创建和应用提供了更大的灵活性，具有与其他生成模型竞争的结果潜力。

Abstract: The Poisson Flow Consistency Model (PFCM) is a consistency-style model based
on the robust Poisson Flow Generative Model++ (PFGM++) which has achieved
success in unconditional image generation and CT image denoising. Yet the PFCM
can only be trained in distillation which limits the potential of the PFCM in
many data modalities. The objective of this research was to create a method to
train the PFCM in isolation called Poisson Flow Consistency Training (PFCT).
The perturbation kernel was leveraged to remove the pretrained PFGM++, and the
sinusoidal discretization schedule and Beta noise distribution were introduced
in order to facilitate adaptability and improve sample quality. The model was
applied to the task of low dose computed tomography image denoising and
improved the low dose image in terms of LPIPS and SSIM. It also displayed
similar denoising effectiveness as models like the Consistency Model. PFCT is
established as a valid method of training the PFCM from its effectiveness in
denoising CT images, showing potential with competitive results to other
generative models. Further study is needed in the precise optimization of PFCT
and in its applicability to other generative modeling tasks. The framework of
PFCT creates more flexibility for the ways in which a PFCM can be created and
can be applied to the field of generative modeling.

TL;DR: 提出一个三阶段混合框架，使用现代检测和视觉语言模型自动解释2D多视图工程图，包括布局分割、方向感知注释检测和语义内容解析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决手动方法、通用OCR系统或传统深度学习方法在解释复杂多视图工程图时的挑战，包括变化布局、方向和混合符号文本内容。

Method: 三阶段方法：1) YOLOv11-det进行布局分割；2) YOLOv11-obb进行方向感知细粒度注释检测；3) 两个基于Donut的OCR-free VLM进行语义内容解析（字母VLM和数字VLM）。

Result: 字母VLM总体F1得分为0.672，数字VLM达到0.963，在文本和定量解释方面表现强劲。开发了两个专用数据集（1,000张布局检测图和1,406张注释级训练图）。

Conclusion: 统一的JSON输出能够与CAD和制造数据库无缝集成，为智能工程图分析提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Engineering drawings are fundamental to manufacturing communication, serving
as the primary medium for conveying design intent, tolerances, and production
details. However, interpreting complex multi-view drawings with dense
annotations remains challenging using manual methods, generic optical character
recognition (OCR) systems, or traditional deep learning approaches, due to
varied layouts, orientations, and mixed symbolic-textual content. To address
these challenges, this paper proposes a three-stage hybrid framework for the
automated interpretation of 2D multi-view engineering drawings using modern
detection and vision language models (VLMs). In the first stage, YOLOv11-det
performs layout segmentation to localize key regions such as views, title
blocks, and notes. The second stage uses YOLOv11-obb for orientation-aware,
fine-grained detection of annotations, including measures, GD&T symbols, and
surface roughness indicators. The third stage employs two Donut-based, OCR-free
VLMs for semantic content parsing: the Alphabetical VLM extracts textual and
categorical information from title blocks and notes, while the Numerical VLM
interprets quantitative data such as measures, GD&T frames, and surface
roughness. Two specialized datasets were developed to ensure robustness and
generalization: 1,000 drawings for layout detection and 1,406 for
annotation-level training. The Alphabetical VLM achieved an overall F1 score of
0.672, while the Numerical VLM reached 0.963, demonstrating strong performance
in textual and quantitative interpretation, respectively. The unified JSON
output enables seamless integration with CAD and manufacturing databases,
providing a scalable solution for intelligent engineering drawing analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在安全关键角点场景中表现不佳，因为训练数据中常见场景过度代表且泛化能力有限，需要提升自动驾驶在罕见但关键情况下的预测可靠性。

Method: 构建紧凑场景表示，结合LLM增强长期推理，使用轻量级时间分词器将轨迹映射到LLM特征空间，引入MoE分解复杂角点场景，专家推断意图并进行反事实推演。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上持续优于SOTA基线，在角点场景和数据缺失条件下保持鲁棒性，展示了基于世界模型架构在自动驾驶运动预测中的潜力。

Conclusion: WM-MoE证明了世界模型架构在实现鲁棒和可泛化运动预测方面的前景，为完全自动驾驶提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable motion forecasting is essential for the safe deployment
of autonomous vehicles (AVs), particularly in rare but safety-critical
scenarios known as corner cases. Existing models often underperform in these
situations due to an over-representation of common scenes in training data and
limited generalization capabilities. To address this limitation, we present
WM-MoE, the first world model-based motion forecasting framework that unifies
perception, temporal memory, and decision making to address the challenges of
high-risk corner-case scenarios. The model constructs a compact scene
representation that explains current observations, anticipates future dynamics,
and evaluates the outcomes of potential actions. To enhance long-horizon
reasoning, we leverage large language models (LLMs) and introduce a lightweight
temporal tokenizer that maps agent trajectories and contextual cues into the
LLM's feature space without additional training, enriching temporal context and
commonsense priors. Furthermore, a mixture-of-experts (MoE) is introduced to
decompose complex corner cases into subproblems and allocate capacity across
scenario types, and a router assigns scenes to specialized experts that infer
agent intent and perform counterfactual rollouts. In addition, we introduce
nuScenes-corner, a new benchmark that comprises four real-world corner-case
scenarios for rigorous evaluation. Extensive experiments on four benchmark
datasets (nuScenes, NGSIM, HighD, and MoCAD) showcase that WM-MoE consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines and remains robust under
corner-case and data-missing conditions, indicating the promise of world
model-based architectures for robust and generalizable motion forecasting in
fully AVs.

Abstract: Accurate assessment of urban canopy coverage is crucial for informed urban
planning, effective environmental monitoring, and mitigating the impacts of
climate change. Traditional practices often face limitations due to inadequate
technical requirements, difficulties in scaling and data processing, and the
lack of specialized expertise. This study presents an efficient approach for
estimating green canopy coverage using artificial intelligence, specifically
computer vision techniques, applied to aerial imageries. Our proposed
methodology utilizes object-based image analysis, based on deep learning
algorithms to accurately identify and segment green canopies from
high-resolution drone images. This approach allows the user for detailed
analysis of urban vegetation, capturing variations in canopy density and
understanding spatial distribution. To overcome the computational challenges
associated with processing large datasets, it was implemented over a cloud
platform utilizing high-performance processors. This infrastructure efficiently
manages space complexity and ensures affordable latency, enabling the rapid
analysis of vast amounts of drone imageries. Our results demonstrate the
effectiveness of this approach in accurately estimating canopy coverage at the
city scale, providing valuable insights for urban forestry management of an
industrial township. The resultant data generated by this method can be used to
optimize tree plantation and assess the carbon sequestration potential of urban
forests. By integrating these insights into sustainable urban planning, we can
foster more resilient urban environments, contributing to a greener and
healthier future.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed an increasing interest in image-text contrastive
modeling, exemplified by models such as Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining
(CLIP). In this paper, we propose the TernaryCLIP, a lightweight computational
framework that converts connection weights of both vision and text encoders of
CLIP into the ternary format, instead of full-precision or floating ones.
TernaryCLIP incorporates quantization-aware training and distillation modules,
preventing precision degradation and enabling low-cost and high-efficiency
computations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TernaryCLIP can
achieve up to 99\% ternarized weights with 1.58-bit representation, 16.98
$\times$ compression ratio, 2.3 $\times$ inference acceleration, 16 $\times$
storage reduction, 10 $\times$ memory optimization, and 60\% sparsity while
maintaining promising performance on zero-shot image classification and
image-text retrieval tasks across 41 commonly used datasets. Our work
highlights the feasibility of extreme quantization for large multimodal models,
supporting effective and efficient deployment on resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning based generative models, particularly
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and
Diffusion Models (DMs), have been instrumental in in generating diverse,
high-quality content across various domains, such as image and video synthesis.
This capability has led to widespread adoption of these models and has captured
strong public interest. As they continue to advance at a rapid pace, the
growing volume of research, expanding application areas, and unresolved

this need, this survey introduces a comprehensive taxonomy that organizes the
literature and provides a cohesive framework for understanding the development
of GANs, VAEs, and DMs, including their many variants and combined approaches.
We highlight key innovations that have improved the quality, diversity, and
controllability of generated outputs, reflecting the expanding potential of
generative artificial intelligence. In addition to summarizing technical
progress, we examine rising ethical concerns, including the risks of misuse and
the broader societal impact of synthetic media. Finally, we outline persistent

TL;DR: SPRINT是一种高效的扩散变换器训练方法，通过分层token丢弃策略实现高达75%的训练成本节省，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器(DiTs)虽然生成性能优异，但其二次训练成本使大规模预训练变得极其昂贵。现有token丢弃方法要么参数量大，要么在高丢弃率下失效。

Method: 采用稀疏-稠密残差融合策略：浅层处理所有token捕获局部细节，深层仅处理稀疏子集以减少计算，通过残差连接融合输出。采用两阶段训练：长掩码预训练+短全token微调。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K 256x256上，SPRINT实现9.8倍训练节省，FID/FDD性能相当。推理时Path-Drop Guidance(PDG)几乎减半FLOPs并提升质量。

Conclusion: SPRINT为高效DiT训练提供了一个简单、有效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) deliver state-of-the-art generative performance
but their quadratic training cost with sequence length makes large-scale
pretraining prohibitively expensive. Token dropping can reduce training cost,
yet na\"ive strategies degrade representations, and existing methods are either
parameter-heavy or fail at high drop ratios. We present SPRINT, Sparse--Dense
Residual Fusion for Efficient Diffusion Transformers, a simple method that
enables aggressive token dropping (up to 75%) while preserving quality. SPRINT
leverages the complementary roles of shallow and deep layers: early layers
process all tokens to capture local detail, deeper layers operate on a sparse
subset to cut computation, and their outputs are fused through residual
connections. Training follows a two-stage schedule: long masked pre-training
for efficiency followed by short full-token fine-tuning to close the
train--inference gap. On ImageNet-1K 256x256, SPRINT achieves 9.8x training
savings with comparable FID/FDD, and at inference, its Path-Drop Guidance (PDG)
nearly halves FLOPs while improving quality. These results establish SPRINT as
a simple, effective, and general solution for efficient DiT training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像合成方面表现出色，但在医学影像等专业领域的微调面临数据稀缺和计算成本高的挑战，需要更高效的适应方法。

Method: 在冻结的扩散U-Net中集成轻量级适配层，结合潜在形态自编码器（用于领域特定潜在一致性）和像素级判别器（用于对抗对齐）增强训练。

Result: 在三个胸部X光数据集上的实验表明，Lite-Diff相比完全微调实现了更优的适应效率。

Conclusion: 该框架为扩散模型中的迁移学习提供了有前景的方向，促进了在低数据领域的部署。

Abstract: In recent years, diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in
high-fidelity image synthesis. However, fine-tuning these models for
specialized domains, such as medical imaging, remains challenging due to
limited domain-specific data and the high computational cost of full model
adaptation. In this paper, we introduce Lite-Diff (Lightweight Diffusion Model
Adaptation), a novel finetuning approach that integrates lightweight adaptation
layers into a frozen diffusion U-Net while enhancing training with a latent
morphological autoencoder (for domain-specific latent consistency) and a pixel
level discriminator(for adversarial alignment). By freezing weights of the base
model and optimizing only small residual adapter modules, LiteDiff
significantly reduces the computational overhead and mitigates overfitting,
even in minimal-data settings. Additionally, we conduct ablation studies to
analyze the effects of selectively integrating adaptation layers in different
U-Net blocks, revealing an optimal balance between efficiency and performance.
Experiments on three chest X-ray datasets - (1) Kaggle Chest X-Ray Pneumonia,
(2) NIH Chest X-ray14 and (3) VinBigData Chest X_ray demonstrate that LiteDiff
achieves superior adaptation efficiency compared to naive full fine-tuning. Our
framework provides a promising direction for transfer learning in diffusion
models, facilitating their deployment in diverse low data domains.

TL;DR: FlowOpt是一个零阶优化框架，将整个流匹配过程视为黑盒，无需反向传播即可在整个采样路径上进行优化，用于图像编辑任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于扩散和流匹配模型的迭代采样过程计算成本高，无法直接使用基于梯度的优化来控制最终生成的图像，现有方法通常需要分别操作每个时间步。

Method: 提出FlowOpt零阶优化框架，将整个流过程视为黑盒，无需反向传播，通过优化整个采样路径来实现控制生成。

Result: FlowOpt在图像编辑任务中达到最先进的结果，同时使用的神经网络函数评估次数与现有方法相当。

Conclusion: FlowOpt提供了一种高效且可监控的优化方法，能够直接控制生成过程，在图像编辑等任务中表现出色。

Abstract: The remarkable success of diffusion and flow-matching models has ignited a
surge of works on adapting them at test time for controlled generation tasks.
Examples range from image editing to restoration, compression and
personalization. However, due to the iterative nature of the sampling process
in those models, it is computationally impractical to use gradient-based
optimization to directly control the image generated at the end of the process.
As a result, existing methods typically resort to manipulating each timestep
separately. Here we introduce FlowOpt - a zero-order (gradient-free)
optimization framework that treats the entire flow process as a black box,
enabling optimization through the whole sampling path without backpropagation
through the model. Our method is both highly efficient and allows users to
monitor the intermediate optimization results and perform early stopping if
desired. We prove a sufficient condition on FlowOpt's step-size, under which
convergence to the global optimum is guaranteed. We further show how to
empirically estimate this upper bound so as to choose an appropriate step-size.
We demonstrate how FlowOpt can be used for image editing, showcasing two
options: (i) inversion (determining the initial noise that generates a given
image), and (ii) directly steering the edited image to be similar to the source
image while conforming to a target text prompt. In both cases, FlowOpt achieves
state-of-the-art results while using roughly the same number of neural function
evaluations (NFEs) as existing methods. Code and examples are available on the
project's webpage.

Method: 基于CNN-LSTM混合架构，使用Mediapipe进行手势关键点提取，采用Python、TensorFlow和Streamlit开发实时手势翻译系统

Result: 系统平均准确率达到92%，对"你好"、"谢谢"等明显手势表现良好，但对视觉相似手势如"打电话"和"是"仍存在混淆

Conclusion: 该工作为医疗、教育和公共服务等领域的应用开辟了有趣的前景

Abstract: Sign languages play a crucial role in the communication of deaf communities,
but they are often marginalized, limiting access to essential services such as
healthcare and education. This study proposes an automatic sign language
recognition system based on a hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture, using Mediapipe for
gesture keypoint extraction. Developed with Python, TensorFlow and Streamlit,
the system provides real-time gesture translation. The results show an average
accuracy of 92\%, with very good performance for distinct gestures such as
``Hello'' and ``Thank you''. However, some confusions remain for visually
similar gestures, such as ``Call'' and ``Yes''. This work opens up interesting
perspectives for applications in various fields such as healthcare, education
and public services.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器学习中鲁棒性的关键问题，特别是在显著性地图方法中，当虚假特征和显著特征在像素空间中重叠时可能产生误导性解释。

Method: 通过新颖的网络手术方法将待解释的独立模型集成到对比语言-图像预训练(CLIP)模型中，创建基于字幕的XAI模型。

Result: 该方法能够识别对模型预测贡献最大的主导概念，最小化独立模型对协变量偏移的敏感性。

Conclusion: 基于字幕的XAI方法显著有助于开发更鲁棒的机器学习模型，通过提供更准确的解释来避免模型被虚假特征误导。

Abstract: Robustness has become one of the most critical problems in machine learning
(ML). The science of interpreting ML models to understand their behavior and
improve their robustness is referred to as explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI). One of the state-of-the-art XAI methods for computer vision problems is
to generate saliency maps. A saliency map highlights the pixel space of an
image that excites the ML model the most. However, this property could be
misleading if spurious and salient features are present in overlapping pixel
spaces. In this paper, we propose a caption-based XAI method, which integrates
a standalone model to be explained into the contrastive language-image
pre-training (CLIP) model using a novel network surgery approach. The resulting
caption-based XAI model identifies the dominant concept that contributes the
most to the models prediction. This explanation minimizes the risk of the
standalone model falling for a covariate shift and contributes significantly
towards developing robust ML models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLM-SlideEval框架评估视觉语言模型在幻灯片理解方面的能力，发现当前模型在像素级提取和跨幻灯片叙事结构理解方面表现不佳，但在单幻灯片内容理解上表现较好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型越来越多地用于评估多模态内容，包括演示幻灯片，但它们在幻灯片特定理解方面的能力尚未得到充分探索，尽管它们在代理式、模型前向管道中作为批评者的角色日益重要。

Method: 引入VLM-SlideEval评估框架，从三个维度测试VLMs：(1)元素级提取与真实标注对齐；(2)对几何、样式和文本扰动的鲁棒性；(3)高级理解能力，如从乱序幻灯片恢复叙事顺序。使用Zenodo公开数据集，从PowerPoint XML和实时渲染中标准化真实元素元数据。

Result: 实证研究表明，VLMs在像素精确提取方面表现不佳，在受控扰动下显示出非平凡的协议性、保真度和一致性，在单幻灯片内容理解方面表现较好，但无法可靠地捕捉跨幻灯片的叙事结构。

Conclusion: 这些结果突显了当前VLMs在幻灯片评估方面的局限性，并推动需要校准的、批评者在环的评估器，以在代理管道中驱动迭代优化和选择。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate multimodal
content, including presentation slides, yet their slide-specific understanding
remains underexplored {despite their growing role as critics in agentic,
model-forward pipelines}. We introduce VLM-SlideEval, an evaluation framework
that probes VLMs along three axes: (1) element-level extraction from slide
images aligned to ground truth; (2) robustness to controlled perturbations in
geometry, style, and text; and (3) higher-level comprehension, such as
recovering a deck's narrative order from shuffled slides. Using publicly
available decks from Zenodo
(https://huggingface.co/datasets/Forceless/Zenodo10K/viewer/default/pptx), we
standardize ground-truth element metadata from PowerPoint XML and live
renderings into a unified, verifiable schema. Empirically, VLMs underperform on
pixel-accurate extraction and show non-trivial agreement, fidelity, and
consistency under controlled perturbations, while performing better on
single-slide content understanding; however, they do not reliably capture
narrative structure across slides. These results highlight the limits of
current VLMs for slide evaluation and motivate calibrated, critic-in-the-loop
evaluators that drive iterative refinement and selection in agentic pipelines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种结合人类中心预处理和时空建模的深度学习框架，用于监控视频中的多类异常检测，在UCF-Crime数据集上达到92.41%的平均准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决监控视频异常检测面临的挑战：异常事件多样性、类别不平衡和场景依赖性视觉干扰。

Method: 使用YOLO-World检测人类实例，ByteTrack进行身份跟踪，高斯模糊抑制背景，InceptionV3提取空间特征，BiLSTM捕获时序动态。

Result: 在UCF-Crime五类子集上平均测试准确率92.41%，各类别F1分数均超过0.85，表现出良好的泛化能力和对类别不平衡的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 前景聚焦的预处理方法显著提升了真实监控场景中的异常判别能力。

Abstract: Anomaly detection in surveillance videos remains a challenging task due to
the diversity of abnormal events, class imbalance, and scene-dependent visual
clutter. To address these issues, we propose a robust deep learning framework
that integrates human-centric preprocessing with spatio-temporal modeling for
multi-class anomaly classification. Our pipeline begins by applying YOLO-World
- an open-vocabulary vision-language detector - to identify human instances in
raw video clips, followed by ByteTrack for consistent identity-aware tracking.
Background regions outside detected bounding boxes are suppressed via Gaussian
blurring, effectively reducing scene-specific distractions and focusing the
model on behaviorally relevant foreground content. The refined frames are then
processed by an ImageNet-pretrained InceptionV3 network for spatial feature
extraction, and temporal dynamics are captured using a bidirectional LSTM
(BiLSTM) for sequence-level classification. Evaluated on a five-class subset of
the UCF-Crime dataset (Normal, Burglary, Fighting, Arson, Explosion), our
method achieves a mean test accuracy of 92.41% across three independent trials,
with per-class F1-scores consistently exceeding 0.85. Comprehensive evaluation
metrics - including confusion matrices, ROC curves, and macro/weighted averages
- demonstrate strong generalization and resilience to class imbalance. The
results confirm that foreground-focused preprocessing significantly enhances
anomaly discrimination in real-world surveillance scenarios.

*Zheng Qi,Chao Shang,Evangelia Spiliopoulou,Nikolaos Pappas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出GIFT方法，通过跟踪视觉注意力在用户查询理解过程中的正向变化（"注视转移"）来预计算整体视觉显著性图，从而增强对显著视觉信息和用户查询的关注，减少视觉语言模型中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型经常产生幻觉内容，现有方法主要归因于过度依赖语言先验知识而非视觉输入。现有方法通过按比例放大视觉标记注意力来缓解幻觉，但忽视了视觉注意力汇聚问题（注意力常被错误分配到任务无关的视觉区域）和跨模态融合平衡问题。

Method: GIFT方法预计算整体视觉显著性图，通过跟踪用户查询理解过程中的视觉注意力正向变化（"注视转移"），利用该图在每个解码步骤中增强对显著视觉信息和用户查询的关注。

Result: 大量实验表明，GIFT在生成和分类任务中都能有效减少视觉语言模型的幻觉，相比贪婪解码实现了高达20.7%的改进，同时以低计算开销保持一般的视觉语言性能。

Conclusion: GIFT通过解决视觉注意力汇聚问题和确保平衡的跨模态融合，有效缓解了视觉语言模型中的幻觉问题，且计算开销低。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) often generate hallucination, i.e., content
that cannot be substantiated by either textual or visual inputs. Prior work
primarily attributes this to over-reliance on linguistic prior knowledge rather
than visual inputs. Some methods attempt to mitigate hallucination by
amplifying visual token attention proportionally to their attention scores.
However, these methods overlook the visual attention sink problem, where
attention is frequently misallocated to task-irrelevant visual regions, and
neglect cross-modal fusion balance by enhancing only visual attention without
adjusting attention to the user query. This can result in amplifying incorrect
areas while failing to properly interpret the user query. To address these
challenges, we propose a simple yet effective method called Gaze Shift-Guided
Cross-modal Fusion Enhancement (GIFT). GIFT pre-computes a holistic visual
saliency map by tracking positive changes in visual attention, or "gaze
shifts", during user query comprehension, and leverages this map to amplify
attention to both salient visual information and the user query at each
decoding step. This reduces the impact of visual attention sink, as irrelevant
tokens exhibit minimal shifts, while ensuring balanced cross-modal fusion for
well-integrated representation. Extensive experiments show that GIFT
effectively mitigates hallucination in VLMs across both generative and
classification tasks, achieving up to 20.7% improvement over greedy decoding,
while maintaining general vision-language performance with low computational
overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同MRI扫描仪型号、采集协议和成像站点引入的变异性阻碍了多中心研究的一致分析和泛化能力。

Method: 使用基于结构相似性指数(SSIM)的可微损失函数，分离评估图像亮度、对比度和结构组件，通过多风格目标进行协调训练。

Result: 协调后结构SSIM达0.97，亮度SSIM达0.98-0.99，脑年龄预测平均绝对误差从5.36年降至3.30年，阿尔茨海默病分类AUC从0.78提升至0.85。

Conclusion: 该框架增强了跨站点图像一致性，保持了解剖保真度，并改善了下游模型性能，为大规模多中心神经影像研究提供了稳健且可泛化的解决方案。

Abstract: The variability introduced by differences in MRI scanner models, acquisition
protocols, and imaging sites hinders consistent analysis and generalizability
across multicenter studies. We present a novel image-based harmonization
framework for 3D T1-weighted brain MRI, which disentangles anatomical content
from scanner- and site-specific variations. The model incorporates a
differentiable loss based on the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) to preserve
biologically meaningful features while reducing inter-site variability. This
loss enables separate evaluation of image luminance, contrast, and structural
components. Training and validation were performed on multiple publicly
available datasets spanning diverse scanners and sites, with testing on both
healthy and clinical populations. Harmonization using multiple style targets,
including style-agnostic references, produced consistent and high-quality
outputs. Visual comparisons, voxel intensity distributions, and SSIM-based
metrics demonstrated that harmonized images achieved strong alignment across
acquisition settings while maintaining anatomical fidelity. Following
harmonization, structural SSIM reached 0.97, luminance SSIM ranged from 0.98 to
0.99, and Wasserstein distances between mean voxel intensity distributions
decreased substantially. Downstream tasks showed substantial improvements: mean
absolute error for brain age prediction decreased from 5.36 to 3.30 years, and
Alzheimer's disease classification AUC increased from 0.78 to 0.85. Overall,
our framework enhances cross-site image consistency, preserves anatomical
fidelity, and improves downstream model performance, providing a robust and
generalizable solution for large-scale multicenter neuroimaging studies.

TL;DR: 多模态大语言模型在坐标预测方面存在困难，特别是在高分辨率输入下。研究发现位置编码扰动会导致可预测的坐标偏差，而非随机错误，表明模型依赖内部位置先验。提出了Vision-PE Shuffle Guidance方法，通过辅助解码和轻量级有限状态机来纠正这些偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉语言任务中表现出色，但在精确坐标预测方面存在挑战，特别是在高分辨率输入下会产生长令牌序列，削弱位置编码并引入坐标输出中的方向偏差。

Method: 提出了Vision-PE Shuffle Guidance方法：通过使用混洗的视觉位置编码进行辅助解码来隔离位置无关的倾向，然后将其作为负证据来指导数字预测，同时通过轻量级有限状态机保持坐标格式。

Result: 在ScreenSpot-Pro数据集上的实验表明，该方法能够可靠地改善坐标预测性能，突出了位置编码鲁棒性对于多模态大语言模型中空间推理的重要性。

Conclusion: 位置编码失败是精确坐标预测的关键瓶颈，Vision-PE Shuffle Guidance通过利用偏差的方向性特征进行校正，为多模态大语言模型的空间推理提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at vision-language tasks such
as VQA and document understanding, yet precise coordinate prediction remains
challenging. High-resolution inputs exacerbate this difficulty by producing
long token sequences that weaken positional encodings and introduce directional
biases in coordinate outputs. We investigate this phenomenon by analyzing how
MLLMs behave when visual positional encodings (VPEs) are deliberately perturbed
through shuffling. Our analysis reveals that such perturbations induce
predictable, non-random coordinate biases rather than random errors, suggesting
that models rely on internal positional priors when spatial grounding signals
are degraded. Crucially, we observe similar directional error patterns in
natural high-resolution datasets, indicating that positional encoding failures
are a key bottleneck for accurate coordinate prediction at scale. To address
this issue, we propose Vision-PE Shuffle Guidance (VPSG), a training-free
test-time method that leverages the directional nature of these biases for
correction. VPSG runs auxiliary decoding with shuffled VPEs to isolate
position-unconditioned tendencies, then uses this as negative evidence to guide
digit prediction while preserving coordinate format through a lightweight
finite-state machine. Experiments on ScreenSpot-Pro demonstrate reliable
improvements, highlighting positional encoding robustness as a critical factor
for spatial reasoning in MLLMs.

TL;DR: Rainbow是一个条件图像生成框架，通过将输入条件分解为不同的潜在表示来生成多样化的图像，解决传统方法在条件不确定性下的多样性不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统条件图像生成方法在条件包含不确定性时难以生成多样化的合理图像，要么通过修改随机种子导致难以区分有意义的差异，要么通过多样化输入提示但受限于可解释的多样性。

Method: 在提示表示计算中集成由GFlowNets参数化的潜在图，利用GFlowNets的高级图采样能力捕获不确定性并生成多样化的轨迹，从而产生多个条件表示和对应的输出图像。

Result: 在自然图像和医学图像数据集上的评估显示，Rainbow在图像合成、图像生成和反事实生成任务中在多样性和保真度方面都有改进。

Conclusion: Rainbow框架能够有效解决条件图像生成中的不确定性，生成多样化且合理的图像，适用于任何预训练的条件生成模型。

Abstract: Capturing diversity is crucial in conditional and prompt-based image
generation, particularly when conditions contain uncertainty that can lead to
multiple plausible outputs. To generate diverse images reflecting this
diversity, traditional methods often modify random seeds, making it difficult
to discern meaningful differences between samples, or diversify the input
prompt, which is limited in verbally interpretable diversity. We propose
Rainbow, a novel conditional image generation framework, applicable to any
pretrained conditional generative model, that addresses inherent
condition/prompt uncertainty and generates diverse plausible images. Rainbow is
based on a simple yet effective idea: decomposing the input condition into
diverse latent representations, each capturing an aspect of the uncertainty and
generating a distinct image. First, we integrate a latent graph, parameterized
by Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets), into the prompt representation
computation. Second, leveraging GFlowNets' advanced graph sampling capabilities
to capture uncertainty and output diverse trajectories over the graph, we
produce multiple trajectories that collectively represent the input condition,
leading to diverse condition representations and corresponding output images.
Evaluations on natural image and medical image datasets demonstrate Rainbow's
improvement in both diversity and fidelity across image synthesis, image
generation, and counterfactual generation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在空间推理任务上表现不佳，主要原因是现有数据集生成方法存在局限性：单图像3D重建会引入级联建模误差，而基于描述的方法需要超详细标注且容易产生生成幻觉。

Method: GRAID框架基于关键洞察：定性空间关系可以仅从2D几何基元可靠确定。通过专门使用标准物体检测器的2D边界框进行操作，避免了3D重建错误和生成幻觉。

Result: 在BDD100k、NuImages和Waymo数据集上生成了超过850万个高质量VQA对，涵盖空间关系、计数、排序和大小比较等问题类型。人类验证准确率达到91.16%，相比现有方法的57.6%有显著提升。

Conclusion: GRAID生成的训练数据使模型能够学习可泛化的空间推理概念，在多种未见问题类型上取得显著性能提升，并在多个现有基准测试中表现优异。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) achieve strong performance on many
vision-language tasks but often struggle with spatial reasoning\textemdash{}a
prerequisite for many applications. Empirically, we find that a dataset
produced by a current training data generation pipeline has a 57.6\% human
validation rate. These rates stem from current limitations: single-image 3D
reconstruction introduces cascading modeling errors and requires wide answer
tolerances, while caption-based methods require hyper-detailed annotations and
suffer from generative hallucinations. We present GRAID, built on the key
insight that qualitative spatial relationships can be reliably determined from
2D geometric primitives alone. By operating exclusively on 2D bounding boxes
from standard object detectors, GRAID avoids both 3D reconstruction errors and
generative hallucinations, resulting in datasets that are of higher quality
than existing tools that produce similar datasets as validated by human
evaluations. We apply our framework to the BDD100k, NuImages, and Waymo
datasets, generating over 8.5 million high-quality VQA pairs creating questions
spanning spatial relations, counting, ranking, and size comparisons. We
evaluate one of the datasets and find it achieves 91.16\% human-validated
accuracy\textemdash{}compared to 57.6\% on a dataset generated by recent work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度立体匹配方法在基准数据集上表现良好，但在零样本泛化方面不如其他视觉任务中的基础模型，特别是在遮挡或弱纹理等挑战性区域。

Method: CogStereo在细化过程中嵌入隐式空间认知，使用单目深度特征作为先验，捕捉超越局部对应关系的整体场景理解。采用双条件细化机制，结合像素级不确定性和认知引导特征进行全局校正。

Result: 在Scene Flow、KITTI、Middlebury、ETH3D、EuRoc和真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，CogStereo不仅实现了最先进的结果，而且在跨域泛化方面表现出色。

Conclusion: CogStereo将立体视觉转向认知驱动的方法，即使在几何信息不足的区域也能确保结构一致的视差估计。

Abstract: Deep stereo matching has advanced significantly on benchmark datasets through
fine-tuning but falls short of the zero-shot generalization seen in foundation
models in other vision tasks. We introduce CogStereo, a novel framework that
addresses challenging regions, such as occlusions or weak textures, without
relying on dataset-specific priors. CogStereo embeds implicit spatial cognition
into the refinement process by using monocular depth features as priors,
capturing holistic scene understanding beyond local correspondences. This
approach ensures structurally coherent disparity estimation, even in areas
where geometry alone is inadequate. CogStereo employs a dual-conditional
refinement mechanism that combines pixel-wise uncertainty with cognition-guided
features for consistent global correction of mismatches. Extensive experiments
on Scene Flow, KITTI, Middlebury, ETH3D, EuRoc, and real-world demonstrate that
CogStereo not only achieves state-of-the-art results but also excels in
cross-domain generalization, shifting stereo vision towards a cognition-driven
approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的视觉语言模型如CLIP在零样本泛化方面表现优异，但对输入损坏引起的分布变化仍然脆弱，需要提高其鲁棒性。

Method: 提出Mint方法，使用均值累加器和梯度累加器在测试时动态最大化基于伪标签的类间方差，适用于小批量处理。

Result: Mint方法在多个损坏基准测试和CLIP架构上都能一致地提升性能，且在小批量情况下仍能有效工作。

Conclusion: 嵌入方差崩溃与性能下降密切相关，通过最大化类间方差可以有效改善嵌入质量，Mint方法为提升CLIP在损坏数据上的鲁棒性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot
generalization but remain vulnerable to distribution shifts caused by input
corruptions. In this work, we investigate how corruptions affect CLIP's image
embeddings and uncover a consistent phenomenon we term as embedding variance
collapse, where both intra-class and inter-class variances shrink as corruption
severity increases. We find that this collapse is closely tied to performance
degradation, with inter-class variance strongly correlated with classification
accuracy. To explain this phenomenon, we analyze how corruptions alter the
structure of the embedding space. Our theoretical results suggest that the
visual encoder tends to encode corruption-related signals, which dilute
class-discriminative features and compress the representation geometry. We
further show that maximizing inter-class variance, even when estimated from
pseudo-labels, can provably enhance embedding quality. Based on this insight,
we propose Mint, a simple test-time adaptation method that maximizes
pseudo-label-based inter-class variance on the fly using a mean accumulator and
a gradient accumulator. Mint operates effectively with small batch sizes and
consistently improves performance across multiple corruption benchmarks and
CLIP architectures. Our code is available at https://github.com/baowenxuan/Mint .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自我中心视觉基准主要忽略影响人类行为的情绪状态，限制了视觉系统捕捉行为内部驱动因素的能力。

Method: 使用Meta的Project Aria眼镜记录同步的眼动视频、光电容积描记、惯性运动数据和生理基线，参与者完成情绪诱发任务和自然活动，使用Circumplex模型和Mikels' Wheel自我报告情绪状态，使用大五人格模型报告人格。

Result: 基于经典学习方法在真实世界情绪预测中，从自我中心视觉系统捕获的信号比处理生理信号产生更好的估计。

Conclusion: 该数据集将情绪和人格确立为自我中心感知的核心维度，为行为、意图和交互的情感驱动建模开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Understanding affect is central to anticipating human behavior, yet current
egocentric vision benchmarks largely ignore the person's emotional states that
shape their decisions and actions. Existing tasks in egocentric perception
focus on physical activities, hand-object interactions, and attention modeling
- assuming neutral affect and uniform personality. This limits the ability of
vision systems to capture key internal drivers of behavior. In this paper, we
present egoEMOTION, the first dataset that couples egocentric visual and
physiological signals with dense self-reports of emotion and personality across
controlled and real-world scenarios. Our dataset includes over 50 hours of
recordings from 43 participants, captured using Meta's Project Aria glasses.
Each session provides synchronized eye-tracking video, headmounted
photoplethysmography, inertial motion data, and physiological baselines for
reference. Participants completed emotion-elicitation tasks and naturalistic
activities while self-reporting their affective state using the Circumplex
Model and Mikels' Wheel as well as their personality via the Big Five model. We
define three benchmark tasks: (1) continuous affect classification (valence,
arousal, dominance); (2) discrete emotion classification; and (3) trait-level
personality inference. We show that a classical learning-based method, as a
simple baseline in real-world affect prediction, produces better estimates from
signals captured on egocentric vision systems than processing physiological
signals. Our dataset establishes emotion and personality as core dimensions in
egocentric perception and opens new directions in affect-driven modeling of
behavior, intent, and interaction.

Abstract: Realistic animatable human avatars from monocular videos are crucial for
advancing human-robot interaction and enhancing immersive virtual experiences.
While recent research on 3DGS-based human avatars has made progress, it still
struggles with accurately representing detailed features of non-rigid objects
(e.g., clothing deformations) and dynamic regions (e.g., rapidly moving limbs).
To address these challenges, we present STG-Avatar, a 3DGS-based framework for
high-fidelity animatable human avatar reconstruction. Specifically, our
framework introduces a rigid-nonrigid coupled deformation framework that
synergistically integrates Spacetime Gaussians (STG) with linear blend skinning
(LBS). In this hybrid design, LBS enables real-time skeletal control by driving
global pose transformations, while STG complements it through spacetime
adaptive optimization of 3D Gaussians. Furthermore, we employ optical flow to
identify high-dynamic regions and guide the adaptive densification of 3D
Gaussians in these regions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both reconstruction
quality and operational efficiency, achieving superior quantitative metrics
while retaining real-time rendering capabilities. Our code is available at

Conclusion: LOC框架有效提升3D场景的开放集理解能力，为视觉语言模型在3D领域的应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown significant progress in open-set
challenges. However, the limited availability of 3D datasets hinders their
effective application in 3D scene understanding. We propose LOC, a general
language-guided framework adaptable to various occupancy networks, supporting
both supervised and self-supervised learning paradigms. For self-supervised
tasks, we employ a strategy that fuses multi-frame LiDAR points for
dynamic/static scenes, using Poisson reconstruction to fill voids, and
assigning semantics to voxels via K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) to obtain
comprehensive voxel representations. To mitigate feature over-homogenization
caused by direct high-dimensional feature distillation, we introduce Densely
Contrastive Learning (DCL). DCL leverages dense voxel semantic information and
predefined textual prompts. This efficiently enhances open-set recognition
without dense pixel-level supervision, and our framework can also leverage
existing ground truth to further improve performance. Our model predicts dense
voxel features embedded in the CLIP feature space, integrating textual and
image pixel information, and classifies based on text and semantic similarity.
Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the method's superior
performance, achieving high-precision predictions for known classes and
distinguishing unknown classes without additional training data.

Method: 使用注意力机制捕获目标对象判别区域，将注意力特征分解为空间和通道注意力进行跨层残差融合和自蒸馏；对比全局-局部表示提升类别感知能力；采用动态质心评估策略获取可信质心和标签。

Conclusion: ARFNet框架通过注意力残差融合、对比学习和动态质心评估，有效缓解了SFDA中的负迁移和域偏移问题，取得了state-of-the-art性能。

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) involves training a model on source
domain and then applying it to a related target domain without access to the
source data and labels during adaptation. The complexity of scene information
and lack of the source domain make SFDA a difficult task. Recent studies have
shown promising results, but many approaches to domain adaptation concentrate
on domain shift and neglect the effects of negative transfer, which may impede
enhancements of model performance during adaptation. n this paper, addressing
this issue, we propose a novel framework of Attention Residual Fusion Network
(ARFNet) based on contrast learning for SFDA to alleviate negative transfer and
domain shift during the progress of adaptation, in which attention residual
fusion, global-local attention contrast, and dynamic centroid evaluation are
exploited. Concretely, the attention mechanism is first exploited to capture
the discriminative region of the target object. Then, in each block, attention
features are decomposed into spatial-wise and channel-wise attentions to
achieve the cross-layer attention residual fusion progressively and
self-distillation. During adaptation progress, we contrast global and local
representations to improve the perceptual capabilities of different categories,
which enables the model to discriminate variations between inner-class and
intra-class. Finally, a dynamic centroid evaluation strategy is exploited to
evaluate the trustworthy centroids and labels for self-supervised
self-distillation, which aims to accurately approximate the center of the
source domain and pseudo-labels to mitigate domain shift. To validate the
efficacy, we execute comprehensive experiments on five benchmarks of varying
scales. Experimental outcomes indicate that our method surpasses other
techniques, attaining superior performance across SFDA benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有NeRF模型主要依赖物体中心采样，无法在媒体退化条件下保持等距和各向同性的度量感知，限制了在复杂环境中的应用。

Method: 提出反向分层上采样策略实现3D空间近均匀采样，建立统一辐射传输模型将发射、吸收和散射统一到粒子模型中，基于Beer-Lambert衰减定律。

Conclusion: I2-NeRF通过改进采样策略和辐射传输建模，成功增强了在复杂媒体环境下的等距和各向同性度量感知能力。

Abstract: Participating in efforts to endow generative AI with the 3D physical world
perception, we propose I2-NeRF, a novel neural radiance field framework that
enhances isometric and isotropic metric perception under media degradation.
While existing NeRF models predominantly rely on object-centric sampling,
I2-NeRF introduces a reverse-stratified upsampling strategy to achieve
near-uniform sampling across 3D space, thereby preserving isometry. We further
present a general radiative formulation for media degradation that unifies
emission, absorption, and scattering into a particle model governed by the
Beer-Lambert attenuation law. By composing the direct and media-induced
in-scatter radiance, this formulation extends naturally to complex media
environments such as underwater, haze, and even low-light scenes. By treating
light propagation uniformly in both vertical and horizontal directions, I2-NeRF
enables isotropic metric perception and can even estimate medium properties
such as water depth. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our
method significantly improves both reconstruction fidelity and physical
plausibility compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: 联合利用模型内部信念和输出概率分布能有效提升不确定性估计性能，HARMONY框架在视觉语言模型的不确定性估计方面达到了新的最先进水平。

Abstract: The growing deployment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in high-stakes
applications such as autonomous driving and assistive technologies for visually
impaired individuals necessitates reliable mechanisms to assess the
trustworthiness of their generation. Uncertainty Estimation (UE) plays a
central role in quantifying the reliability of model outputs and reducing
unsafe generations via selective prediction. In this regard, most existing
probability-based UE approaches rely on output probability distributions,
aggregating token probabilities into a single uncertainty score using
predefined functions such as length-normalization. Another line of research
leverages model hidden representations and trains MLP-based models to predict
uncertainty. However, these methods often fail to capture the complex
multimodal relationships between semantic and textual tokens and struggle to
identify biased probabilities often influenced by language priors. Motivated by
these observations, we propose a novel UE framework, HARMONY, that jointly
leverages fused multimodal information in model activations and the output
distribution of the VLM to determine the reliability of responses. The key
hypothesis of our work is that both the model's internal belief in its visual
understanding, captured by its hidden representations, and the produced token
probabilities carry valuable reliability signals that can be jointly leveraged
to improve UE performance, surpassing approaches that rely on only one of these
components. Experimental results on three open-ended VQA benchmarks, A-OKVQA,
VizWiz, and PathVQA, and three state-of-the-art VLMs, LLaVa-7b, LLaVA-13b and
InstructBLIP demonstrate that our method consistently performs on par with or
better than existing approaches, achieving up to 4\% improvement in AUROC, and
6\% in PRR, establishing new state of the art in uncertainty estimation for
VLMs.

TL;DR: 提出一个简单的非参数生成模型，基于自然图像的三个原则，无需训练即可生成高质量图像样本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然图像生成模型取得了显著进展，但其机制仍然不透明。目标是去除复杂的工程技巧，提出一个简单的非参数生成模型来理解自然图像的结构

Method: 基于自然图像的三个原则：(i)空间非平稳性，(ii)低层规律性，(iii)高层语义，通过局部上下文窗口定义每个像素的分布

Result: 该模型在MNIST上生成高保真样本，在CIFAR-10上生成视觉上引人注目的图像，尽管架构简单且无需训练

Conclusion: 这种简单性与强经验性能的结合指向了自然图像结构的最小理论。模型的白盒性质使我们能够机制性地理解模型如何泛化和生成多样化图像

Abstract: Scaling and architectural advances have produced strikingly photorealistic
image generative models, yet their mechanisms still remain opaque. Rather than
advancing scaling, our goal is to strip away complicated engineering tricks and
propose a simple, non-parametric generative model. Our design is grounded in
three principles of natural images-(i) spatial non-stationarity, (ii) low-level
regularities, and (iii) high-level semantics-and defines each pixel's
distribution from its local context window. Despite its minimal architecture
and no training, the model produces high-fidelity samples on MNIST and visually
compelling CIFAR-10 images. This combination of simplicity and strong empirical
performance points toward a minimal theory of natural-image structure. The
model's white-box nature also allows us to have a mechanistic understanding of
how the model generalizes and generates diverse images. We study it by tracing
each generated pixel back to its source images. These analyses reveal a simple,
compositional procedure for "part-whole generalization", suggesting a
hypothesis for how large neural network generative models learn to generalize.

Abstract: As the demand grows within the construction industry for processes that are
not only faster but also safer and more efficient, offsite construction has
emerged as a solution, though it brings new safety risks due to the close
interaction between workers, machinery, and moving obstacles. Predicting the
future trajectories of workers and taking into account social and environmental
factors is a crucial step for developing collision-avoidance systems to
mitigate such risks. Traditional methods often struggle to adapt to the dynamic
and unpredictable nature of construction environments. Many rely on simplified
assumptions or require hand-crafted features, limiting their ability to respond
to complex, real-time interactions between workers and moving obstacles. While
recent data-driven methods have improved the modeling of temporal patterns,
they still face challenges in capturing long-term behavior and accounting for
the spatial and social context crucial to collision risk assessment. To address
these limitations, this paper proposes a framework integrating YOLOv10n and
DeepSORT for precise detection and tracking, along with two novel trajectory
prediction models: TrajGATFormer and TrajGATFormer-Obstacle. YOLOv10n serves as
the backbone for object detection, accurately identifying workers and obstacles
in diverse scenes, while DeepSORT efficiently tracks them over time with unique
IDs for continuity. Both models employ a transformer encoder-decoder with Graph
Attention Networks (GAT) to capture temporal and spatial interactions.
TrajGATFormer predicts worker trajectories with an ADE of 1.25 m and FDE of 2.3
m over a 4.8 s horizon, while TrajGATFormer-Obstacle extends prediction to both
workers and obstacles, achieving higher accuracy (ADE 1.15 m, FDE 2.2 m).
Comparative analysis shows both models outperform traditional methods, reducing
ADE and FDE by up to 35% and 38%, respectively.

Abstract: Generating dynamic and interactive 3D objects, such as trees, has wide
applications in virtual reality, games, and world simulation. Nevertheless,
existing methods still face various challenges in generating realistic 4D
motion for complex real trees. In this paper, we propose DynamicTree, the first
framework that can generate long-term, interactive animation of 3D Gaussian
Splatting trees. Unlike prior optimization-based methods, our approach
generates dynamics in a fast feed-forward manner. The key success of our
approach is the use of a compact sparse voxel spectrum to represent the tree
movement. Given a 3D tree from Gaussian Splatting reconstruction, our pipeline
first generates mesh motion using the sparse voxel spectrum and then binds
Gaussians to deform the mesh. Additionally, the proposed sparse voxel spectrum
can also serve as a basis for fast modal analysis under external forces,
allowing real-time interactive responses. To train our model, we also introduce
4DTree, the first large-scale synthetic 4D tree dataset containing 8,786
animated tree meshes with semantic labels and 100-frame motion sequences.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves realistic and
responsive tree animations, significantly outperforming existing approaches in

Abstract: Domain Adaptation (DA) provides an effective way to tackle target-domain
tasks by leveraging knowledge learned from source domains. Recent studies have
extended this paradigm to Multi-Source Domain Adaptation (MSDA), which exploits
multiple source domains carrying richer and more diverse transferable
information. However, a substantial performance gap still remains between
adaptation-based methods and fully supervised learning. In this paper, we
explore a more practical and challenging setting, named Multi-Source Active
Domain Adaptation (MS-ADA), to further enhance target-domain performance by
selectively acquiring annotations from the target domain. The key difficulty of
MS-ADA lies in designing selection criteria that can jointly handle inter-class
diversity and multi-source domain variation. To address these challenges, we
propose a simple yet effective GALA strategy (GALA), which combines a global
k-means clustering step for target-domain samples with a cluster-wise local
selection criterion, effectively tackling the above two issues in a
complementary manner. Our proposed GALA is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly
integrated into existing DA frameworks without introducing any additional
trainable parameters. Extensive experiments on three standard DA benchmarks
demonstrate that GALA consistently outperforms prior active learning and active
DA methods, achieving performance comparable to the fully-supervised upperbound
while using only 1% of the target annotations.

Abstract: Existing deep learning-based models for remote sensing pansharpening exhibit
exceptional performance on training datasets. However, due to sensor-specific
characteristics and varying imaging conditions, these models suffer from
substantial performance degradation when applied to unseen satellite data,
lacking generalizability and thus limiting their applicability. We argue that
the performance drops stem primarily from distributional discrepancies from
different sources and the key to addressing this challenge lies in bridging the
gap between training and testing distributions. To validate the idea and
further achieve a "train once, deploy forever" capability, this paper
introduces a novel and intuitive approach to enpower any pansharpening models
with generalizability by employing a unified distribution strategy (UniPAN).
Specifically, we construct a distribution transformation function that
normalizes the pixels sampled from different sources to conform to an identical
distribution. The deep models are trained on the transformed domain, and during
testing on new datasets, the new data are also transformed to match the
training distribution. UniPAN aims to train and test the model on a unified and
consistent distribution, thereby enhancing its generalizability. Extensive
experiments validate the efficacy of UniPAN, demonstrating its potential to
significantly enhance the performance of deep pansharpening models across
diverse satellite sensors. Codes: https://github.com/yc-cui/UniPAN.

Method: 两阶段选择流程：第一阶段使用MaxHerding进行分层表示候选选择，选择代表性像素并构建多样化全局池；第二阶段在噪声多尺度扩散特征上计算熵增强分歧评分(eDALD)，结合认知不确定性和预测置信度选择最信息丰富的像素。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation demands dense pixel-level annotations, which can be
prohibitively expensive - especially under extremely constrained labeling
budgets. In this paper, we address the problem of low-budget active learning
for semantic segmentation by proposing a novel two-stage selection pipeline.
Our approach leverages a pre-trained diffusion model to extract rich
multi-scale features that capture both global structure and fine details. In
the first stage, we perform a hierarchical, representation-based candidate
selection by first choosing a small subset of representative pixels per image
using MaxHerding, and then refining these into a diverse global pool. In the
second stage, we compute an entropy-augmented disagreement score (eDALD) over
noisy multi-scale diffusion features to capture both epistemic uncertainty and
prediction confidence, selecting the most informative pixels for annotation.
This decoupling of diversity and uncertainty lets us achieve high segmentation
accuracy with only a tiny fraction of labeled pixels. Extensive experiments on
four benchmarks (CamVid, ADE-Bed, Cityscapes, and Pascal-Context) demonstrate
that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines under extreme
pixel-budget regimes. Our code is available at

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel diffusion-based model for lane detection,
called DiffusionLane, which treats the lane detection task as a denoising
diffusion process in the parameter space of the lane. Firstly, we add the
Gaussian noise to the parameters (the starting point and the angle) of ground
truth lanes to obtain noisy lane anchors, and the model learns to refine the
noisy lane anchors in a progressive way to obtain the target lanes. Secondly,
we propose a hybrid decoding strategy to address the poor feature
representation of the encoder, resulting from the noisy lane anchors.
Specifically, we design a hybrid diffusion decoder to combine global-level and
local-level decoders for high-quality lane anchors. Then, to improve the
feature representation of the encoder, we employ an auxiliary head in the
training stage to adopt the learnable lane anchors for enriching the
supervision on the encoder. Experimental results on four benchmarks, Carlane,
Tusimple, CULane, and LLAMAS, show that DiffusionLane possesses a strong
generalization ability and promising detection performance compared to the
previous state-of-the-art methods. For example, DiffusionLane with ResNet18
surpasses the existing methods by at least 1\% accuracy on the domain
adaptation dataset Carlane. Besides, DiffusionLane with MobileNetV4 gets
81.32\% F1 score on CULane, 96.89\% accuracy on Tusimple with ResNet34, and
97.59\% F1 score on LLAMAS with ResNet101. Code will be available at

Abstract: Semantic segmentation has emerged as a fundamental problem in computer
vision, gaining particular importance in real-time applications such as
autonomous driving. The main challenge is achieving high accuracy while
operating under computational and hardware constraints. In this research, we
present an FPGA-based implementation of real-time semantic segmentation
leveraging the lightweight LMIINet architecture and the Coarse-Grained
Reconfigurable Array for Machine Learning (CGRA4ML) hardware framework. The
model was trained using Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) with 8-bit precision
on the Cityscapes dataset, reducing memory footprint by a factor of four while
enabling efficient fixed-point computations. Necessary modifications were
applied to adapt the model to CGRA4ML constraints, including simplifying skip
connections, employing hardware-friendly operations such as depthwise-separable
and 1A-1 convolutions, and redesigning parts of the Flatten Transformer. Our
implementation achieves approximately 90% pixel accuracy and 45% mean
Intersection-over-Union (mIoU), operating in real-time at 20 frames per second
(FPS) with 50.1 ms latency on the ZCU104 FPGA board. The results demonstrate
the potential of CGRA4ML, with its flexibility in mapping modern layers and
off-chip memory utilization for skip connections, provides a path for
implementing advanced semantic segmentation networks on FPGA for real-time
applications to outperform traditional GPU solutions in terms of power
efficiency while maintaining competitive accuracy. The code for this project is

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的事故预测范式，从当前帧风险评分转向直接预测多个未来时间步的事故分数，使用精确标注的事故时间戳作为监督，在保持可接受误报率的情况下实现更可靠的预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用模糊的二元监督（将所有事故视频帧标记为正样本），而风险随时间连续变化，导致学习不可靠和误报。需要更精确的监督信号来准确预测事故。

Method: 使用片段级编码器联合建模时空动态，基于Transformer的时间解码器通过专用时间查询同时预测所有未来时间范围的事故分数。引入改进的评估协议，在误报率可接受范围内报告时间到事故和召回率。

Result: 实验表明该方法在现实误报率约束下，在召回率和时间到事故指标上都实现了优越性能。

Conclusion: 提出的新范式通过直接预测未来事故分数和使用精确时间戳监督，显著提高了事故预测的可靠性和实用性，减少了误报问题。

Abstract: Accident anticipation aims to predict potential collisions in an online
manner, enabling timely alerts to enhance road safety. Existing methods
typically predict frame-level risk scores as indicators of hazard. However,
these approaches rely on ambiguous binary supervision (labeling all frames in
accident videos as positive) despite the fact that risk varies continuously
over time, leading to unreliable learning and false alarms. To address this, we
propose a novel paradigm that shifts the prediction target from current-frame
risk scoring to directly estimating accident scores at multiple future time
steps (e.g., 0.1s-2.0s ahead), leveraging precisely annotated accident
timestamps as supervision. Our method employs a snippet-level encoder to
jointly model spatial and temporal dynamics, and a Transformer-based temporal
decoder that predicts accident scores for all future horizons simultaneously
using dedicated temporal queries. Furthermore, we introduce a refined
evaluation protocol that reports Time-to-Accident (TTA) and recall (evaluated
at multiple pre-accident intervals (0.5s, 1.0s, and 1.5s)) only when the false
alarm rate (FAR) remains within an acceptable range, ensuring practical
relevance. Experiments show that our method achieves superior performance in
both recall and TTA under realistic FAR constraints.

Motivation: 空对地行人重识别面临极端视角差异、遮挡和域差距等挑战，现有方法在处理严重姿态变化和空间不对齐方面存在局限。

Method: GSAlign包含两个关键组件：可学习薄板样条模块自适应扭曲行人特征以补偿几何变化，动态对齐模块估计可见性感知表示掩码以减轻遮挡影响。

Result: 在CARGO数据集上的四个匹配协议评估中，相比先前最优方法，在空对地设置下mAP提升18.8%，Rank-1准确率提升16.8%。

Conclusion: GSAlign通过联合处理几何和语义对齐，有效解决了空对地行人重识别中的视角差异和遮挡问题，取得了显著性能提升。

Abstract: Aerial-Ground person re-identification (AG-ReID) is an emerging yet
challenging task that aims to match pedestrian images captured from drastically
different viewpoints, typically from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and
ground-based surveillance cameras. The task poses significant challenges due to
extreme viewpoint discrepancies, occlusions, and domain gaps between aerial and
ground imagery. While prior works have made progress by learning cross-view
representations, they remain limited in handling severe pose variations and
spatial misalignment. To address these issues, we propose a Geometric and
Semantic Alignment Network (GSAlign) tailored for AG-ReID. GSAlign introduces
two key components to jointly tackle geometric distortion and semantic
misalignment in aerial-ground matching: a Learnable Thin Plate Spline (LTPS)
Module and a Dynamic Alignment Module (DAM). The LTPS module adaptively warps
pedestrian features based on a set of learned keypoints, effectively
compensating for geometric variations caused by extreme viewpoint changes. In
parallel, the DAM estimates visibility-aware representation masks that
highlight visible body regions at the semantic level, thereby alleviating the
negative impact of occlusions and partial observations in cross-view
correspondence. A comprehensive evaluation on CARGO with four matching
protocols demonstrates the effectiveness of GSAlign, achieving significant
improvements of +18.8\% in mAP and +16.8\% in Rank-1 accuracy over previous
state-of-the-art methods on the aerial-ground setting. The code is available

Abstract: Large-scale and high-quality image-text pair datasets play an important role
in developing high-performing Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In this work, we
introduce WAON, a large-scale and high-quality Japanese image-text pair dataset
containing approximately 155 million examples, collected from Common Crawl. Our
dataset construction pipeline employs various techniques, including filtering
and deduplication, which have been shown to be effective in previous studies.
To evaluate its effectiveness, we also construct WAON-Bench, a manually curated

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了强化学习与大型视觉语言模型结合在可解释和通用城市社会经济感知方面的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Harnessing publicly available, large-scale web data, such as street view and
satellite imagery, urban socio-economic sensing is of paramount importance for
achieving global sustainable development goals. With the emergence of Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), new opportunities have arisen to solve this
task by treating it as a multi-modal perception and understanding problem.
However, recent studies reveal that LVLMs still struggle with accurate and
interpretable socio-economic predictions from visual data. To address these
limitations and maximize the potential of LVLMs, we introduce
\textbf{CityRiSE}, a novel framework for \textbf{R}eason\textbf{i}ng urban
\textbf{S}ocio-\textbf{E}conomic status in LVLMs through pure reinforcement
learning (RL). With carefully curated multi-modal data and verifiable reward
design, our approach guides the LVLM to focus on semantically meaningful visual
cues, enabling structured and goal-oriented reasoning for generalist
socio-economic status prediction. Experiments demonstrate that CityRiSE with
emergent reasoning process significantly outperforms existing baselines,
improving both prediction accuracy and generalization across diverse urban
contexts, particularly for prediction on unseen cities and unseen indicators.
This work highlights the promise of combining RL and LVLMs for interpretable
and generalist urban socio-economic sensing.

TL;DR: GRPO-Guard通过重要性比率归一化和梯度重加权技术，解决了GRPO强化学习中重要性比率分布偏移问题，有效防止隐式过优化，提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GRPO强化学习框架中，重要性比率分布存在系统性偏移（均值低于1且方差不一致），导致PPO裁剪机制无法有效约束过度自信的正向梯度更新，造成隐式过优化问题。

Method: 提出GRPO-Guard方法，包含两个关键技术：1）比率归一化，恢复平衡且步长一致的重要性比率分布；2）梯度重加权，均衡不同噪声条件下的策略梯度。

Result: 在多个扩散模型（SD3.5M、Flux.1-dev）和多样化代理任务上的实验表明，GRPO-Guard显著减少了过优化现象，同时保持甚至提升了生成质量。

Conclusion: GRPO-Guard作为一种简单有效的增强方法，通过调节裁剪机制稳定了优化过程，无需依赖繁重的KL正则化即可显著缓解隐式过优化问题。

Abstract: Recently, GRPO-based reinforcement learning has shown remarkable progress in
optimizing flow-matching models, effectively improving their alignment with
task-specific rewards. Within these frameworks, the policy update relies on
importance-ratio clipping to constrain overconfident positive and negative
gradients. However, in practice, we observe a systematic shift in the
importance-ratio distribution-its mean falls below 1 and its variance differs
substantially across timesteps. This left-shifted and inconsistent distribution
prevents positive-advantage samples from entering the clipped region, causing
the mechanism to fail in constraining overconfident positive updates. As a
result, the policy model inevitably enters an implicit over-optimization
stage-while the proxy reward continues to increase, essential metrics such as
image quality and text-prompt alignment deteriorate sharply, ultimately making
the learned policy impractical for real-world use. To address this issue, we
introduce GRPO-Guard, a simple yet effective enhancement to existing GRPO
frameworks. Our method incorporates ratio normalization, which restores a
balanced and step-consistent importance ratio, ensuring that PPO clipping
properly constrains harmful updates across denoising timesteps. In addition, a
gradient reweighting strategy equalizes policy gradients over noise conditions,
preventing excessive updates from particular timestep regions. Together, these
designs act as a regulated clipping mechanism, stabilizing optimization and
substantially mitigating implicit over-optimization without relying on heavy KL
regularization. Extensive experiments on multiple diffusion backbones (e.g.,
SD3.5M, Flux.1-dev) and diverse proxy tasks demonstrate that GRPO-Guard
significantly reduces over-optimization while maintaining or even improving
generation quality.

Conclusion: 实验结果证明了所提出的基于图的机制的有效性，该方法能够显著提升自监督表示学习的性能。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates graph theory into
self-supervised representation learning. Traditional methods focus on
intra-instance variations generated by applying augmentations. However, they
often overlook important inter-instance relationships. While our method retains
the intra-instance property, it further captures inter-instance relationships
by constructing k-nearest neighbor (KNN) graphs for both teacher and student
streams during pretraining. In these graphs, nodes represent samples along with
their latent representations. Edges encode the similarity between instances.
Following pretraining, a representation refinement phase is performed. In this
phase, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) propagate messages not only among immediate
neighbors but also across multiple hops, thereby enabling broader contextual
integration. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, ImageNet-100, and ImageNet-1K
demonstrate accuracy improvements of 7.3%, 3.2%, and 1.0%, respectively, over
state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the effectiveness of the
proposed graph based mechanism. The code is publicly available at

TL;DR: MindHier是一个从粗到细的fMRI到图像重建框架，通过分层自回归建模解决了现有扩散方法中固定引导的问题，实现了更符合人类视觉感知的分层重建过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的方法通常将fMRI活动映射到单个高层嵌入，并在整个生成过程中作为固定引导。但这种固定引导会压缩分层神经信息，且与图像重建的阶段需求不匹配。

Method: 提出了三个组件：分层fMRI编码器提取多级神经嵌入、层次到层次对齐方案与CLIP特征建立层间对应关系、尺度感知的从粗到细神经引导策略，在匹配尺度上将这些嵌入注入自回归过程。

Result: 在NSD数据集上的实验表明，MindHier比基于扩散的基线方法实现了更好的语义保真度、4.67倍的推理速度提升，以及更确定性的结果。

Conclusion: MindHier通过分层重建过程（先合成全局语义再细化局部细节）提供了一个高效且认知对齐的替代方案，更符合人类视觉感知机制。

Abstract: Reconstructing visual stimuli from fMRI signals is a central challenge
bridging machine learning and neuroscience. Recent diffusion-based methods
typically map fMRI activity to a single high-level embedding, using it as fixed
guidance throughout the entire generation process. However, this fixed guidance
collapses hierarchical neural information and is misaligned with the
stage-dependent demands of image reconstruction. In response, we propose
MindHier, a coarse-to-fine fMRI-to-image reconstruction framework built on
scale-wise autoregressive modeling. MindHier introduces three components: a
Hierarchical fMRI Encoder to extract multi-level neural embeddings, a
Hierarchy-to-Hierarchy Alignment scheme to enforce layer-wise correspondence
with CLIP features, and a Scale-Aware Coarse-to-Fine Neural Guidance strategy
to inject these embeddings into autoregression at matching scales. These
designs make MindHier an efficient and cognitively-aligned alternative to
diffusion-based methods by enabling a hierarchical reconstruction process that
synthesizes global semantics before refining local details, akin to human
visual perception. Extensive experiments on the NSD dataset show that MindHier
achieves superior semantic fidelity, 4.67x faster inference, and more
deterministic results than the diffusion-based baselines.

Abstract: Precise geometric control in image generation is essential for engineering \&
product design and creative industries to control 3D object features accurately

specialized skills, while current image-based generative methods lack accuracy
in geometric conditioning. To address these challenges, we propose
GeoDiffusion, a training-free framework for accurate and efficient geometric
conditioning of 3D features in image generation. GeoDiffusion employs a
class-specific 3D object as a geometric prior to define keypoints and
parametric correlations in 3D space. We ensure viewpoint consistency through a
rendered image of a reference 3D object, followed by style transfer to meet
user-defined appearance specifications. At the core of our framework is
GeoDrag, improving accuracy and speed of drag-based image editing on geometry
guidance tasks and general instructions on DragBench. Our results demonstrate

Abstract: 3D reconstruction of endoscopic surgery scenes plays a vital role in
enhancing scene perception, enabling AR visualization, and supporting
context-aware decision-making in image-guided surgery. A critical yet
challenging step in this process is the accurate estimation of the endoscope's
intrinsic parameters. In real surgical settings, intrinsic calibration is
hindered by sterility constraints and the use of specialized endoscopes with
continuous zoom and telescope rotation. Most existing methods for endoscopic 3D
reconstruction do not estimate intrinsic parameters, limiting their
effectiveness for accurate and reliable reconstruction. In this paper, we
integrate intrinsic parameter estimation into a self-supervised monocular depth
estimation framework by adapting the Depth Anything V2 (DA2) model for joint
depth, pose, and intrinsics prediction. We introduce an attention-based pose
network and a Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) strategy for
efficient fine-tuning of DA2. Our method is validated on the SCARED and C3VD
public datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to recent
state-of-the-art approaches in self-supervised monocular depth estimation and
3D reconstruction. Code and model weights can be found in project repository:

Abstract: Diffusion models have advanced rapidly in recent years, producing
high-fidelity images while raising concerns about intellectual property
protection and the misuse of generative AI. Image watermarking for diffusion
models, particularly Noise-as-Watermark (NaW) methods, encode watermark as
specific standard Gaussian noise vector for image generation, embedding the
infomation seamlessly while maintaining image quality. For detection, the
generation process is inverted to recover the initial noise vector containing
the watermark before extraction. However, existing NaW methods struggle to
balance watermark robustness with generation diversity. Some methods achieve
strong robustness by heavily constraining initial noise sampling, which
degrades user experience, while others preserve diversity but prove too fragile
for real-world deployment. To address this issue, we propose T2SMark, a
two-stage watermarking scheme based on Tail-Truncated Sampling (TTS). Unlike
prior methods that simply map bits to positive or negative values, TTS enhances
robustness by embedding bits exclusively in the reliable tail regions while
randomly sampling the central zone to preserve the latent distribution. Our
two-stage framework then ensures sampling diversity by integrating a randomly
generated session key into both encryption pipelines. We evaluate T2SMark on
diffusion models with both U-Net and DiT backbones. Extensive experiments show
that it achieves an optimal balance between robustness and diversity. Our code

Abstract: Deformable image registration estimates voxel-wise correspondences between
images through spatial transformations, and plays a key role in medical
imaging. While deep learning methods have significantly reduced runtime,
efficiently handling large deformations remains a challenging task.
Convolutional networks aggregate local features but lack direct modeling of
voxel correspondences, promoting recent works to explore explicit feature
matching. Among them, voxel-to-region matching is more efficient for direct
correspondence modeling by computing local correlation features whithin
neighbourhoods, while region-to-region matching incurs higher redundancy due to
excessive correlation pairs across large regions. However, the inherent
locality of voxel-to-region matching hinders the capture of long-range
correspondences required for large deformations. To address this, we propose a
Recurrent Correlation-based framework that dynamically relocates the matching
region toward more promising positions. At each step, local matching is
performed with low cost, and the estimated offset guides the next search
region, supporting efficient convergence toward large deformations. In
addition, we uses a lightweight recurrent update module with memory capacity
and decouples motion-related and texture features to suppress semantic
redundancy. We conduct extensive experiments on brain MRI and abdominal CT
datasets under two settings: with and without affine pre-registration. Results
show that our method exibits a strong accuracy-computation trade-off,
surpassing or matching the state-of-the-art performance. For example, it
achieves comparable performance on the non-affine OASIS dataset, while using
only 9.5% of the FLOPs and running 96% faster than RDP, a representative
high-performing method.

TL;DR: 提出了一种完全可解释且灵活的统计方法，用于路边LiDAR数据中的背景减除，旨在增强自动驾驶中基于基础设施的感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了增强自动驾驶中基于基础设施的感知能力，需要一种能够有效处理路边LiDAR数据背景减除的方法，该方法需要支持多种LiDAR类型并适应不同配置。

Method: 引入了高斯分布网格（GDG）来使用仅背景扫描建模背景的空间统计特性，以及一个利用这种表示将LiDAR点分类为前景或背景的过滤算法。

Result: 在公开可用的RCooper数据集上评估，该方法在准确性和灵活性方面优于最先进的技术，即使在背景数据最少的情况下也能表现出色。

Conclusion: 该方法的高效实现确保了在低资源硬件上的可靠性能，使得可扩展的实际部署成为可能。

Abstract: We present a fully interpretable and flexible statistical method for
background subtraction in roadside LiDAR data, aimed at enhancing
infrastructure-based perception in automated driving. Our approach introduces
both a Gaussian distribution grid (GDG), which models the spatial statistics of
the background using background-only scans, and a filtering algorithm that uses
this representation to classify LiDAR points as foreground or background. The
method supports diverse LiDAR types, including multiline 360 degree and
micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) sensors, and adapts to various
configurations. Evaluated on the publicly available RCooper dataset, it
outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in accuracy and flexibility, even with
minimal background data. Its efficient implementation ensures reliable
performance on low-resource hardware, enabling scalable real-world deployment.

TL;DR: 提出了TDSR框架，将图像描述重新定义为分层规划问题，通过高效的MCTS算法显著减少大模型调用次数，提升描述质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大视觉语言模型在图像描述中的矛盾：单步生成能力强但缺乏全局叙事连贯性，难以平衡细节捕捉与整体一致性。

Method: 将图像描述建模为马尔可夫决策过程，设计高效的蒙特卡洛树搜索算法，包含视觉引导并行扩展和轻量级价值网络，并采用自适应早停机制。

Result: 在DetailCaps、COMPOSITIONCAP和POPE等多个基准测试中取得最优或极具竞争力的结果，显著提升现有VLM模型的细粒度描述、组合泛化和幻觉抑制能力。

Conclusion: TDSR作为即插即用模块，能够有效解决大视觉语言模型在图像描述中的规划问题，在保持高质量的同时大幅降低计算开销。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face an inherent contradiction in image
captioning: their powerful single-step generation capabilities often lead to a
myopic decision-making process. This makes it difficult to maintain global
narrative coherence while capturing rich details, a limitation that is
particularly pronounced in tasks that require multi-step and complex scene
description. To overcome this fundamental challenge, we redefine image
captioning as a goal-oriented hierarchical refinement planning problem, and
further propose a novel framework, named Top-Down Semantic Refinement (TDSR),
which models the generation process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP).
However, planning within the vast state space of a VLM presents a significant
computational hurdle. Our core contribution, therefore, is the design of a
highly efficient Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm tailored for VLMs. By
incorporating a visual-guided parallel expansion and a lightweight value
network, our TDSR reduces the call frequency to the expensive VLM by an order
of magnitude without sacrificing planning quality. Furthermore, an adaptive
early stopping mechanism dynamically matches computational overhead to the
image's complexity. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, including
DetailCaps, COMPOSITIONCAP, and POPE, demonstrate that our TDSR, as a
plug-and-play module, can significantly enhance the performance of existing
VLMs (e.g., LLaVA-1.5, Qwen2.5-VL) by achieving state-of-the-art or highly
competitive results in fine-grained description, compositional generalization,
and hallucination suppression.

Motivation: LiDAR传感器在恶劣天气条件下性能显著下降，特别是在降雪天气中，这会影响自动驾驶系统的感知能力。目前对于不同天气条件下信号衰减的程度缺乏量化研究。

Method: 开发基于物理的模型分析LiDAR在雪天条件下的失效模式，研究不同降雪率下的信号衰减，利用模型将晴朗天气数据转换为模拟雪天场景，生成合成数据并与实际雪天条件进行比较。

Result: 建立了能够模拟不同降雪率下LiDAR信号衰减的物理模型，生成了代表不同降雪条件的合成数据，并评估了这些条件对预训练目标检测模型性能的影响。

Conclusion: 该研究量化了LiDAR在雪天条件下的性能衰减，为改善自动驾驶系统在恶劣天气下的感知能力提供了理论基础和数据支持。

Abstract: Because 3D structure of a roadway environment can be characterized directly
by a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors, they can be used to obtain
exceptional situational awareness for assitive and autonomous driving systems.
Although LiDARs demonstrate good performance in clean and clear weather
conditions, their performance significantly deteriorates in adverse weather
conditions such as those involving atmospheric precipitation. This may render
perception capabilities of autonomous systems that use LiDAR data in learning
based models to perform object detection and ranging ineffective. While efforts
have been made to enhance the accuracy of these models, the extent of signal
degradation under various weather conditions remains largely not quantified. In
this study, we focus on the performance of an automotive grade LiDAR in snowy
conditions in order to develop a physics-based model that examines failure
modes of a LiDAR sensor. Specifically, we investigated how the LiDAR signal
attenuates with different snowfall rates and how snow particles near the source
serve as small but efficient reflectors. Utilizing our model, we transform data
from clear conditions to simulate snowy scenarios, enabling a comparison of our
synthetic data with actual snowy conditions. Furthermore, we employ this
synthetic data, representative of different snowfall rates, to explore the
impact on a pre-trained object detection model, assessing its performance under
varying levels of snowfall

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决可穿戴辅助代理中的目标推断问题，消除用户与代理交互所需的努力，通过多模态上下文观察来推断用户目标。

Method: 创建WAGIBench基准，收集包含视觉、音频、数字和纵向上下文观察的多模态数据集，评估多种现代视觉语言模型在目标推断任务上的表现。

Result: 人类表现达到93%的多选题准确率，而最佳视觉语言模型为84%；生成式基准显示较大模型表现更好，但仅55%的时间产生相关目标，距离实际应用仍有差距。

Conclusion: 多模态信息对模型有益，但当前视觉语言模型在可穿戴辅助代理的目标推断任务上仍远未达到实用水平，需要进一步改进。

Abstract: There has been a surge of interest in assistive wearable agents: agents
embodied in wearable form factors (e.g., smart glasses) who take assistive
actions toward a user's goal/query (e.g. "Where did I leave my keys?"). In this
work, we consider the important complementary problem of inferring that goal
from multi-modal contextual observations. Solving this "goal inference" problem
holds the promise of eliminating the effort needed to interact with such an
agent. This work focuses on creating WAGIBench, a strong benchmark to measure
progress in solving this problem using vision-language models (VLMs). Given the
limited prior work in this area, we collected a novel dataset comprising 29
hours of multimodal data from 348 participants across 3,477 recordings,
featuring ground-truth goals alongside accompanying visual, audio, digital, and
longitudinal contextual observations. We validate that human performance
exceeds model performance, achieving 93% multiple-choice accuracy compared with
84% for the best-performing VLM. Generative benchmark results that evaluate
several families of modern vision-language models show that larger models
perform significantly better on the task, yet remain far from practical
usefulness, as they produce relevant goals only 55% of the time. Through a
modality ablation, we show that models benefit from extra information in
relevant modalities with minimal performance degradation from irrelevant
modalities.

Conclusion: 该半监督框架成功解决了CryoET中粒子挑选的瓶颈问题，通过利用未标记数据显著提升了检测性能，为冷冻电子断层扫描数据分析提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Cryogenic Electron Tomography (CryoET) combined with sub-volume averaging
(SVA) is the only imaging modality capable of resolving protein structures
inside cells at molecular resolution. Particle picking, the task of localizing
and classifying target proteins in 3D CryoET volumes, remains the main
bottleneck. Due to the reliance on time-consuming manual labels, the vast
reserve of unlabeled tomograms remains underutilized. In this work, we present
a fast, label-efficient semi-supervised framework that exploits this untapped
data. Our framework consists of two components: (i) an end-to-end
heatmap-supervised detection model inspired by keypoint detection, and (ii) a
teacher-student co-training mechanism that enhances performance under sparse
labeling conditions. Furthermore, we introduce multi-view pseudo-labeling and a
CryoET-specific DropBlock augmentation strategy to further boost performance.
Extensive evaluations on the large-scale CZII dataset show that our approach
improves F1 by 10% over supervised baselines, underscoring the promise of
semi-supervised learning for leveraging unlabeled CryoET data.

Motivation: 现有方法在建模时间依赖性和准确捕捉动态几何变化方面存在局限，特别是在考虑相机视角变化时。

Method: 使用3D高斯溅射从单张图像构建3D模型，然后基于选定视图的单次支持预测多视角姿态关键点，利用监督信号增强运动一致性。

Result: 实验结果显示DynaPose4D在动态运动生成中实现了优秀的连贯性、一致性和流畅性。

Conclusion: 验证了DynaPose4D框架的有效性，并展示了其在计算机视觉和动画制作领域的应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in 2D and 3D generative models have expanded the
capabilities of computer vision. However, generating high-quality 4D dynamic
content from a single static image remains a significant challenge. Traditional
methods have limitations in modeling temporal dependencies and accurately
capturing dynamic geometry changes, especially when considering variations in
camera perspective. To address this issue, we propose DynaPose4D, an innovative
solution that integrates 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) techniques with
Category-Agnostic Pose Estimation (CAPE) technology. This framework uses 3D
Gaussian Splatting to construct a 3D model from single images, then predicts
multi-view pose keypoints based on one-shot support from a chosen view,
leveraging supervisory signals to enhance motion consistency. Experimental
results show that DynaPose4D achieves excellent coherence, consistency, and
fluidity in dynamic motion generation. These findings not only validate the
efficacy of the DynaPose4D framework but also indicate its potential
applications in the domains of computer vision and animation production.

Motivation: 现有知识蒸馏方法需要多个教师网络来实现多样性，计算成本高昂。本文旨在通过单个教师网络生成多样化知识视角，降低成本的同时提升蒸馏性能。

Method: 在单个教师网络上附加多个分支生成多视角，引入两种角度多样性目标：约束性角度间多样性损失（最大化视角间角度同时保持与原始输出的接近性）和角度内多样性损失（鼓励视角在原始输出周围均匀分布）。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多种配置下超越了现有的知识增强方法，且能与其它知识蒸馏框架即插即用地结合，持续提升泛化性能。

Conclusion: 提出的角度多样性知识增强方法能够有效提升知识蒸馏性能，在保持计算效率的同时实现更好的学生模型训练效果。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) aims to train a lightweight student model by
transferring knowledge from a large, high-capacity teacher. Recent studies have
shown that leveraging diverse teacher perspectives can significantly improve
distillation performance; however, achieving such diversity typically requires
multiple teacher networks, leading to high computational costs. In this work,
we propose a novel cost-efficient knowledge augmentation method for KD that
generates diverse multi-views by attaching multiple branches to a single
teacher. To ensure meaningful semantic variation across multi-views, we
introduce two angular diversity objectives: 1) constrained inter-angle
diversify loss, which maximizes angles between augmented views while preserving
proximity to the original teacher output, and 2) intra-angle diversify loss,
which encourages an even distribution of views around the original output. The
ensembled knowledge from these angularly diverse views, along with the original
teacher, is distilled into the student. We further theoretically demonstrate
that our objectives increase the diversity among ensemble members and thereby
reduce the upper bound of the ensemble's expected loss, leading to more
effective distillation. Experimental results show that our method surpasses an
existing knowledge augmentation method across diverse configurations. Moreover,
the proposed method is compatible with other KD frameworks in a plug-and-play
fashion, providing consistent improvements in generalization performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于幅度的MRI模态（如T1w）对帕金森病病理敏感性不足，而基于相位的QSM技术能更好地量化深部灰质核团中的铁沉积，因此需要开发能有效整合这两种模态的诊断方法。

Method: 使用门控融合模块学习模态特定的注意力权重和通道级门控向量，进行选择性特征调制，通过分层门控机制增强ROI感知特征并抑制无关信号。

Result: 方法在三个现有最先进方法中表现最佳，达到85.00%准确率和92.06% AUC，消融研究验证了ROI引导、多模态整合和融合定位的贡献。

Conclusion: GateFuseNet通过自适应融合QSM和T1w图像，有效提升了帕金森病的诊断性能，可视化分析确认模型聚焦于临床相关病理区域。

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) from MRI remains challenging
due to symptom variability and pathological heterogeneity. Most existing
methods rely on conventional magnitude-based MRI modalities, such as
T1-weighted images (T1w), which are less sensitive to PD pathology than
Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM), a phase-based MRI technique that
quantifies iron deposition in deep gray matter nuclei. In this study, we
propose GateFuseNet, an adaptive 3D multimodal fusion network that integrates
QSM and T1w images for PD diagnosis. The core innovation lies in a gated fusion
module that learns modality-specific attention weights and channel-wise gating
vectors for selective feature modulation. This hierarchical gating mechanism
enhances ROI-aware features while suppressing irrelevant signals. Experimental
results show that our method outperforms three existing state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving 85.00% accuracy and 92.06% AUC. Ablation studies further
validate the contributions of ROI guidance, multimodal integration, and fusion
positioning. Grad-CAM visualizations confirm the model's focus on clinically
relevant pathological regions. The source codes and pretrained models can be

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型在生成逼真图像方面取得显著进展，但经常产生与可验证知识相矛盾的输出，特别是在涉及细粒度属性或时间敏感事件的提示时。传统的检索增强方法由于依赖静态来源和浅层证据整合，无法基于准确和演化的知识进行生成。

Method: ORIG框架迭代地从网络检索和过滤多模态证据，并逐步将精炼知识整合到增强提示中来指导图像生成。还构建了FIG-Eval基准，涵盖感知、组合和时间三个维度的十个类别。

Result: 实验表明，ORIG相比强基线方法，在事实一致性和整体图像质量方面都有显著提升。

Conclusion: ORIG展示了开放多模态检索在事实图像生成方面的潜力，为解决多模态模型的事实一致性问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
generating photorealistic and prompt-aligned images, but they often produce
outputs that contradict verifiable knowledge, especially when prompts involve
fine-grained attributes or time-sensitive events. Conventional
retrieval-augmented approaches attempt to address this issue by introducing
external information, yet they are fundamentally incapable of grounding
generation in accurate and evolving knowledge due to their reliance on static
sources and shallow evidence integration. To bridge this gap, we introduce
ORIG, an agentic open multimodal retrieval-augmented framework for Factual
Image Generation (FIG), a new task that requires both visual realism and
factual grounding. ORIG iteratively retrieves and filters multimodal evidence
from the web and incrementally integrates the refined knowledge into enriched
prompts to guide generation. To support systematic evaluation, we build
FIG-Eval, a benchmark spanning ten categories across perceptual, compositional,
and temporal dimensions. Experiments demonstrate that ORIG substantially
improves factual consistency and overall image quality over strong baselines,
highlighting the potential of open multimodal retrieval for factual image
generation.

Motivation: 现有图像裁剪方法在全局性和多样性方面存在不足，且缺乏对摄影构图指导的整合。美学驱动的图像裁剪对于提升用户参与度至关重要，而构图是影响视觉吸引力的关键因素。

Method: 提出AesCrop模型，集成VMamba图像编码器、新颖的MCAB注意力偏置和transformer解码器，通过将构图线索显式编码到注意力机制中，引导模型关注构图最显著的区域。

Result: 大量实验表明，AesCrop在定量指标上优于当前最先进方法，并能产生视觉上更令人愉悦的裁剪结果。

Conclusion: AesCrop通过整合构图知识，成功解决了现有混合方法在全局性和多样性方面的局限性，为美学驱动的图像裁剪提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Aesthetic-driven image cropping is crucial for applications like view
recommendation and thumbnail generation, where visual appeal significantly
impacts user engagement. A key factor in visual appeal is composition--the
deliberate arrangement of elements within an image. Some methods have
successfully incorporated compositional knowledge through evaluation-based and
regression-based paradigms. However, evaluation-based methods lack globality
while regression-based methods lack diversity. Recently, hybrid approaches that
integrate both paradigms have emerged, bridging the gap between these two to
achieve better diversity and globality. Notably, existing hybrid methods do not
incorporate photographic composition guidance, a key attribute that defines
photographic aesthetics. In this work, we introduce AesCrop, a
composition-aware hybrid image-cropping model that integrates a VMamba image
encoder, augmented with a novel Mamba Composition Attention Bias (MCAB) and a
transformer decoder to perform end-to-end rank-based image cropping, generating
multiple crops along with the corresponding quality scores. By explicitly
encoding compositional cues into the attention mechanism, MCAB directs AesCrop
to focus on the most compositionally salient regions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that AesCrop outperforms current state-of-the-art methods,
delivering superior quantitative metrics and qualitatively more pleasing crops.

Result: 在公共数据集和自建受限管道数据集上的实验表明，BoWG在精度-召回率和计算效率方面优于最先进方法，在Bicocca25b数据集上平均每张图像处理时间仅16ms

Conclusion: BoWG方法在感知混淆环境中实现了优越的闭环检测性能，具有高精度、强鲁棒性和计算效率

Abstract: Loop closure is critical in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
systems to reduce accumulative drift and ensure global mapping consistency.
However, conventional methods struggle in perceptually aliased environments,
such as narrow pipes, due to vector quantization, feature sparsity, and
repetitive textures, while existing solutions often incur high computational
costs. This paper presents Bag-of-Word-Groups (BoWG), a novel loop closure
detection method that achieves superior precision-recall, robustness, and
computational efficiency. The core innovation lies in the introduction of word
groups, which captures the spatial co-occurrence and proximity of visual words
to construct an online dictionary. Additionally, drawing inspiration from
probabilistic transition models, we incorporate temporal consistency directly
into similarity computation with an adaptive scheme, substantially improving
precision-recall performance. The method is further strengthened by a feature
distribution analysis module and dedicated post-verification mechanisms. To
evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on both public
datasets and a confined-pipe dataset we constructed. Results demonstrate that
BoWG surpasses state-of-the-art methods, including both traditional and
learning-based approaches, in terms of precision-recall and computational
efficiency. Our approach also exhibits excellent scalability, achieving an
average processing time of 16 ms per image across 17,565 images in the

<details>

Motivation: 现有基于扩散的超分辨率方法因文本条件不准确不完整，以及交叉注意力偏向无关像素，导致语义错位和幻觉细节。

Method: 提出SRSR框架，包含两个核心组件：1) 空间重聚焦交叉注意力(SRCA)，使用视觉分割掩码指导交叉注意力；2) 空间目标分类器自由引导(STCFG)，选择性绕过未接地像素的文本影响。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，SRSR在PSNR和SSIM指标上全面优于7个最先进基线，在真实基准测试的LPIPS和DISTS感知质量指标上也表现更好。

Conclusion: SRSR框架在超分辨率任务中同时实现了高语义保真度和感知质量。

Abstract: Existing diffusion-based super-resolution approaches often exhibit semantic
ambiguities due to inaccuracies and incompleteness in their text conditioning,
coupled with the inherent tendency for cross-attention to divert towards
irrelevant pixels. These limitations can lead to semantic misalignment and
hallucinated details in the generated high-resolution outputs. To address
these, we propose a novel, plug-and-play spatially re-focused super-resolution
(SRSR) framework that consists of two core components: first, we introduce
Spatially Re-focused Cross-Attention (SRCA), which refines text conditioning at
inference time by applying visually-grounded segmentation masks to guide
cross-attention. Second, we introduce a Spatially Targeted Classifier-Free
Guidance (STCFG) mechanism that selectively bypasses text influences on
ungrounded pixels to prevent hallucinations. Extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that SRSR consistently
outperforms seven state-of-the-art baselines in standard fidelity metrics (PSNR
and SSIM) across all datasets, and in perceptual quality measures (LPIPS and
DISTS) on two real-world benchmarks, underscoring its effectiveness in
achieving both high semantic fidelity and perceptual quality in
super-resolution.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STATUS Bench是首个专门评估视觉语言模型理解物体状态变化能力的基准测试，包含三个同步任务：物体状态识别、图像检索和状态变化识别。实验表明当前最先进的VLMs在识别细微物体状态差异方面仍有困难，大多数开源模型在零样本设置下表现仅达到随机水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然现有的视觉语言模型能够执行多种多模态任务，但它们在识别物体状态（如位置状态和功能状态）方面的精确度尚不明确。为了解决这个问题，需要建立一个专门的基准来严格评估VLMs理解物体状态细微变化的能力。

Method: 提出了STATUS Bench基准测试，包含三个同步任务：物体状态识别(OSI)、图像检索(IR)和状态变化识别(SCI)。基于手工制作的图像对数据集，包含对应的物体状态描述和状态变化描述。同时创建了包含1300万半自动生成描述的STATUS Train训练数据集。

Result: 实验表明，在严格的评估方案下，大多数开源VLMs的零样本性能仅达到随机水平。经过STATUS Train微调后，Qwen2.5-VL的性能可与Gemini 2.0 Flash相媲美。当前最先进的VLMs在捕捉细微物体状态差异方面仍存在显著困难。

Conclusion: STATUS Bench和STATUS Train对于推进VLM研究中物体状态识别的发展具有必要性，揭示了当前模型在理解物体状态变化方面的局限性，并为未来研究提供了重要的基准和训练资源。

Abstract: Object state recognition aims to identify the specific condition of objects,
such as their positional states (e.g., open or closed) and functional states
(e.g., on or off). While recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are capable of
performing a variety of multimodal tasks, it remains unclear how precisely they
can identify object states. To alleviate this issue, we introduce the STAte and
Transition UnderStanding Benchmark (STATUS Bench), the first benchmark for
rigorously evaluating the ability of VLMs to understand subtle variations in
object states in diverse situations. Specifically, STATUS Bench introduces a
novel evaluation scheme that requires VLMs to perform three tasks
simultaneously: object state identification (OSI), image retrieval (IR), and
state change identification (SCI). These tasks are defined over our fully
hand-crafted dataset involving image pairs, their corresponding object state
descriptions and state change descriptions. Furthermore, we introduce a
large-scale training dataset, namely STATUS Train, which consists of 13 million
semi-automatically created descriptions. This dataset serves as the largest
resource to facilitate further research in this area. In our experiments, we
demonstrate that STATUS Bench enables rigorous consistency evaluation and
reveal that current state-of-the-art VLMs still significantly struggle to
capture subtle object state distinctions. Surprisingly, under the proposed
rigorous evaluation scheme, most open-weight VLMs exhibited chance-level

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确分析自发的无意识微表情对于揭示真实人类情感至关重要，但在野外场景（如自然对话）中仍具挑战性。现有研究主要依赖受控实验室环境的数据集，在真实世界中性能急剧下降。

Method: 1) 构建首个专注于野外对话场景的微表情数据集；2) 提出端到端的定位和检测框架MELDAE；3) 设计新颖的边界感知损失函数，通过惩罚起始和结束错误来提高时间精度。

Result: 在WDMD数据集上实现了最先进的结果，关键F1_{DR}定位指标比最强基线提高了17.72%，同时在现有基准测试中表现出优异的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该研究为解决野外场景微表情分析提供了有效的解决方案，显著提升了在真实世界环境中的性能表现。

Abstract: Accurately analyzing spontaneous, unconscious micro-expressions is crucial
for revealing true human emotions, but this task remains challenging in wild
scenarios, such as natural conversation. Existing research largely relies on
datasets from controlled laboratory environments, and their performance
degrades dramatically in the real world. To address this issue, we propose
three contributions: the first micro-expression dataset focused on
conversational-in-the-wild scenarios; an end-to-end localization and detection
framework, MELDAE; and a novel boundary-aware loss function that improves
temporal accuracy by penalizing onset and offset errors. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art results on the WDMD
dataset, improving the key F1_{DR} localization metric by 17.72% over the
strongest baseline, while also demonstrating excellent generalization
capabilities on existing benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了XLFM-Zebrafish基准数据集、MVN-LF自监督任务和ORC损失函数，显著提升了XLFM的3D重建性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决XLFM中学习型3D重建的两个核心挑战：缺乏标准化数据集和缺乏能有效建模角度-空间结构的方法。

Method: 构建XLFM-Zebrafish基准数据集；提出MVN-LF自监督任务学习角度先验；设计ORC损失函数确保预测体积与PSF前向投影的一致性。

Result: 在XLFM-Zebrafish基准上，PSNR比现有最优方法提升了7.7%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过标准化数据集、自监督学习和物理约束，有效解决了XLFM 3D重建的关键问题，显著提升了重建质量。

Abstract: Light field microscopy (LFM) has become an emerging tool in neuroscience for
large-scale neural imaging in vivo, notable for its single-exposure volumetric
imaging, broad field of view, and high temporal resolution. However,
learning-based 3D reconstruction in XLFM remains underdeveloped due to two core
challenges: the absence of standardized datasets and the lack of methods that
can efficiently model its angular-spatial structure while remaining physically
grounded. We address these challenges by introducing three key contributions.
First, we construct the XLFM-Zebrafish benchmark, a large-scale dataset and
evaluation suite for XLFM reconstruction. Second, we propose Masked View
Modeling for Light Fields (MVN-LF), a self-supervised task that learns angular
priors by predicting occluded views, improving data efficiency. Third, we
formulate the Optical Rendering Consistency Loss (ORC Loss), a differentiable
rendering constraint that enforces alignment between predicted volumes and
their PSF-based forward projections. On the XLFM-Zebrafish benchmark, our
method improves PSNR by 7.7% over state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: PFED是一个资源高效的跨视角地理定位框架，通过分层知识蒸馏和多视图表示精炼，在保持高精度的同时显著提升效率，适合边缘设备部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有跨视角地理定位方法依赖资源密集型细粒度特征提取和对齐的问题，这些方法的多分支和多模块显著增加推理成本，限制了在边缘设备上的部署。

Method: 提出PFED框架，包含两个关键组件：1) 训练时的分层蒸馏范式HD-CVGL和不确定性感知预测对齐UAPA；2) 推理时的多视图精炼模块MRM，利用互信息过滤冗余样本。

Result: 在University-1652数据集上达到97.15%的Recall@1，FLOPs效率提升5倍以上，速度提升3倍，在AGX Orin边缘设备上达到251.5 FPS。

Conclusion: PFED在精度和效率方面均达到最先进水平，证明了其在实时无人机应用中的实际可行性。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) enables UAV localization by matching
aerial images to geo-tagged satellite databases, which is critical for
autonomous navigation in GNSS-denied environments. However, existing methods
rely on resource-intensive fine-grained feature extraction and alignment, where
multiple branches and modules significantly increase inference costs, limiting
their deployment on edge devices. We propose Precision-Focused Efficient Design
(PFED), a resource-efficient framework combining hierarchical knowledge
transfer and multi-view representation refinement. This innovative method
comprises two key components: 1) During training, Hierarchical Distillation
paradigm for fast and accurate CVGL (HD-CVGL), coupled with Uncertainty-Aware
Prediction Alignment (UAPA) to distill essential information and mitigate the
data imbalance without incurring additional inference overhead. 2) During
inference, an efficient Multi-view Refinement Module (MRM) leverages mutual
information to filter redundant samples and effectively utilize the multi-view
data. Extensive experiments show that PFED achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both accuracy and efficiency, reaching 97.15\% Recall@1 on
University-1652 while being over $5 \times$ more efficient in FLOPs and $3
\times$ faster than previous top methods. Furthermore, PFED runs at 251.5 FPS
on the AGX Orin edge device, demonstrating its practical viability for
real-time UAV applications. The project is available at

TL;DR: PSScreen V2是一个部分监督自训练框架，用于多种视网膜疾病筛查，通过三分支架构处理部分标记数据和领域偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法依赖完全标记或单领域数据集的局限性，应对标签缺失和领域偏移的双重挑战。

Method: 采用一个教师和两个学生网络的三分支架构，教师分支生成伪标签，学生分支使用低频丢弃和低频不确定性等特征增强策略。

Conclusion: PSScreen V2框架具有强大的领域适应性和通用性，为医学图像分析提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we propose PSScreen V2, a partially supervised self-training
framework for multiple retinal disease screening. Unlike previous methods that
rely on fully labelled or single-domain datasets, PSScreen V2 is designed to
learn from multiple partially labelled datasets with different distributions,
addressing both label absence and domain shift challenges. To this end,
PSScreen V2 adopts a three-branch architecture with one teacher and two student
networks. The teacher branch generates pseudo labels from weakly augmented
images to address missing labels, while the two student branches introduce
novel feature augmentation strategies: Low-Frequency Dropout (LF-Dropout),
which enhances domain robustness by randomly discarding domain-related
low-frequency components, and Low-Frequency Uncertainty (LF-Uncert), which
estimates uncertain domain variability via adversarially learned Gaussian
perturbations of low-frequency statistics. Extensive experiments on multiple
in-domain and out-of-domain fundus datasets demonstrate that PSScreen V2
achieves state-of-the-art performance and superior domain generalization
ability. Furthermore, compatibility tests with diverse backbones, including the
vision foundation model DINOv2, as well as evaluations on chest X-ray datasets,
highlight the universality and adaptability of the proposed framework. The
codes are available at https://github.com/boyiZheng99/PSScreen_V2.

TL;DR: 提出了一种投影嵌入扩散桥（PEDB）方法，通过引入新的反向随机微分方程，在CT图像重建中同时利用FBP重建结果和投影数据，显著提升了从不完整投影数据重建CT图像的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从不完整投影数据重建CT图像的病态问题，现有扩散桥模型主要关注从FBP重建中恢复干净图像，但如何将数据一致性融入这些模型仍待探索。

Method: 提出PEDB方法，设计新的反向SDE，在采样干净图像时同时以FBP重建和投影数据为条件，将投影数据嵌入到反向SDE的得分函数中，并引入参数控制随机性水平。

Result: 在稀疏视图、有限角度和截断投影三种不完整数据类型的CT重建中，PEDB在标准、噪声和域偏移评估中均优于现有最先进的扩散桥模型。

Conclusion: PEDB通过显式地将投影数据条件化到干净图像采样中，自然地融入了数据一致性，有效提升了CT重建的保真度和细节恢复能力。

Abstract: Reconstructing CT images from incomplete projection data remains challenging
due to the ill-posed nature of the problem. Diffusion bridge models have
recently shown promise in restoring clean images from their corresponding
Filtered Back Projection (FBP) reconstructions, but incorporating data
consistency into these models remains largely underexplored. Incorporating data
consistency can improve reconstruction fidelity by aligning the reconstructed
image with the observed projection data, and can enhance detail recovery by
integrating structural information contained in the projections. In this work,
we propose the Projection Embedded Diffusion Bridge (PEDB). PEDB introduces a
novel reverse stochastic differential equation (SDE) to sample from the
distribution of clean images conditioned on both the FBP reconstruction and the
incomplete projection data. By explicitly conditioning on the projection data
in sampling the clean images, PEDB naturally incorporates data consistency. We
embed the projection data into the score function of the reverse SDE. Under
certain assumptions, we derive a tractable expression for the posterior score.
In addition, we introduce a free parameter to control the level of
stochasticity in the reverse process. We also design a discretization scheme
for the reverse SDE to mitigate discretization error. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PEDB achieves strong performance in CT reconstruction from
three types of incomplete data, including sparse-view, limited-angle, and
truncated projections. For each of these types, PEDB outperforms evaluated
state-of-the-art diffusion bridge models across standard, noisy, and
domain-shift evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用小波基空间中的稀疏、分布式和多尺度表示，通过自监督学习范式挖掘潜在对称性，消除对地面真值的依赖。

Method: 三阶段架构：SWANencoder将小波系数映射到低维潜在空间，SWANdecoder重建输入小波系数，SWANforward学习高光谱图像的物理特性。使用Adam优化器和Sigmoid激活函数防止过拟合。

Result: 在合成和真实高光谱数据集上的实验表明，相比现有神经网络解混方法，SWAN在定性和定量评估中均表现出性能提升。

Conclusion: SWAN通过学习弹性解混函数、促进自监督和紧凑网络参数，为实际应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In this article, we present SWAN: a three-stage, self-supervised wavelet
neural network for joint estimation of endmembers and abundances from
hyperspectral imagery. The contiguous and overlapping hyperspectral band images
are first expanded to Biorthogonal wavelet basis space that provides sparse,
distributed, and multi-scale representations. The idea is to exploit latent
symmetries from thus obtained invariant and covariant features using a
self-supervised learning paradigm. The first stage, SWANencoder maps the input
wavelet coefficients to a compact lower-dimensional latent space. The second
stage, SWANdecoder uses the derived latent representation to reconstruct the
input wavelet coefficients. Interestingly, the third stage SWANforward learns
the underlying physics of the hyperspectral image. A three-stage combined loss
function is formulated in the image acquisition domain that eliminates the need
for ground truth and enables self-supervised training. Adam is employed for
optimizing the proposed loss function, while Sigmoid with a dropout of 0.3 is
incorporated to avoid possible overfitting. Kernel regularizers bound the
magnitudes and preserve spatial variations in the estimated endmember
coefficients. The output of SWANencoder represents estimated abundance maps
during inference, while weights of SWANdecoder are retrieved to extract
endmembers. Experiments are conducted on two benchmark synthetic data sets with
different signal-to-noise ratios as well as on three real benchmark
hyperspectral data sets while comparing the results with several
state-of-the-art neural network-based unmixing methods. The qualitative,
quantitative, and ablation results show performance enhancement by learning a
resilient unmixing function as well as promoting self-supervision and compact
network parameters for practical applications.

Motivation: 解决畜牧业中缺乏大规模标注数据集的问题，探索利用在斑马合成图像上训练的模型迁移到奶牛姿态估计的可能性。

Method: 采用ZebraPose视觉transformer模型，在三个数据集配置上评估：自定义农场数据集、APT-36K基准数据集子集及其组合，系统评估模型在真实牛舍条件下的准确性和泛化能力。

Result: 组合模型在分布内数据上表现良好（AP=0.86，AR=0.87，PCK 0.5=0.869），但在未见牛舍和奶牛群体中泛化失败严重，显示物种间形态相似性不足以支持跨域迁移。

Conclusion: 呼吁农业优先的AI设计，强调农场级真实性、跨环境鲁棒性和开放基准数据集的重要性，以推进可信赖且可扩展的动物中心技术。

Abstract: Pose estimation serves as a cornerstone of computer vision for understanding
animal posture, behavior, and welfare. Yet, agricultural applications remain
constrained by the scarcity of large, annotated datasets for livestock,
especially dairy cattle. This study evaluates the potential and limitations of
cross-species transfer learning by adapting ZebraPose - a vision
transformer-based model trained on synthetic zebra imagery - for 27-keypoint
detection in dairy cows under real barn conditions. Using three configurations
- a custom on-farm dataset (375 images, Sussex, New Brunswick, Canada), a
subset of the APT-36K benchmark dataset, and their combination, we
systematically assessed model accuracy and generalization across environments.
While the combined model achieved promising performance (AP = 0.86, AR = 0.87,
PCK 0.5 = 0.869) on in-distribution data, substantial generalization failures
occurred when applied to unseen barns and cow populations. These findings
expose the synthetic-to-real domain gap as a major obstacle to agricultural AI
deployment and emphasize that morphological similarity between species is
insufficient for cross-domain transfer. The study provides practical insights
into dataset diversity, environmental variability, and computational
constraints that influence real-world deployment of livestock monitoring
systems. We conclude with a call for agriculture-first AI design, prioritizing
farm-level realism, cross-environment robustness, and open benchmark datasets
to advance trustworthy and scalable animal-centric technologies.

combining DenseNet-121 with stain-aware augmentation and imbalance-adaptive

Motivation: 扩散模型在图像合成方面表现出色，但对其输出进行精确控制和定向编辑仍然具有挑战性。现有方法通常依赖大量图像采样或训练辅助网络，效率有限。

Method: 通过分析预训练扩散模型中自注意力权重矩阵的特征向量，直接推导出语义编辑方向，无需额外数据或模型微调。

Result: 实验表明该方法在多个数据集上产生高质量的编辑效果，同时将编辑时间显著减少了60%。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效、无需额外训练的语义编辑解决方案，通过分析模型内部参数直接获得可解释的编辑方向。

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve remarkable fidelity in image synthesis, yet precise
control over their outputs for targeted editing remains challenging. A key step
toward controllability is to identify interpretable directions in the model's
latent representations that correspond to semantic attributes. Existing
approaches for finding interpretable directions typically rely on sampling
large sets of images or training auxiliary networks, which limits efficiency.
We propose an analytical method that derives semantic editing directions
directly from the pretrained parameters of diffusion models, requiring neither
additional data nor fine-tuning. Our insight is that self-attention weight
matrices encode rich structural information about the data distribution learned
during training. By computing the eigenvectors of these weight matrices, we
obtain robust and interpretable editing directions. Experiments demonstrate
that our method produces high-quality edits across multiple datasets while
reducing editing time significantly by 60% over current benchmarks.

Conclusion: SARCLIP提升了SAR图像的语义理解能力，代码和数据集即将发布。

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has emerged as a crucial imaging modality due
to its all-weather capabilities. While recent advancements in self-supervised
learning and Masked Image Modeling (MIM) have paved the way for SAR foundation
models, these approaches primarily focus on low-level visual features, often
overlooking multimodal alignment and zero-shot target recognition within SAR
imagery. To address this limitation, we construct SARCLIP-1M, a large-scale
vision language dataset comprising over one million text-image pairs aggregated
from existing datasets. We further introduce SARCLIP, the first vision language
foundation model tailored for the SAR domain. Our SARCLIP model is trained
using a contrastive vision language learning approach by domain transferring
strategy, enabling it to bridge the gap between SAR imagery and textual
descriptions. Extensive experiments on image-text retrieval and zero-shot
classification tasks demonstrate the superior performance of SARCLIP in feature
extraction and interpretation, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art
foundation models and advancing the semantic understanding of SAR imagery. The
code and datasets will be released soon.

Conclusion: LVD-GS系统通过多模态融合和动态建模，有效提升了大规模动态室外场景下的SLAM重建鲁棒性和精度。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM has emerged as a widely used technique for
high-fidelity mapping in spatial intelligence. However, existing methods often
rely on a single representation scheme, which limits their performance in
large-scale dynamic outdoor scenes and leads to cumulative pose errors and
scale ambiguity. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{LVD-GS}, a
novel LiDAR-Visual 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM system. Motivated by the human
chain-of-thought process for information seeking, we introduce a hierarchical
collaborative representation module that facilitates mutual reinforcement for
mapping optimization, effectively mitigating scale drift and enhancing
reconstruction robustness. Furthermore, to effectively eliminate the influence
of dynamic objects, we propose a joint dynamic modeling module that generates
fine-grained dynamic masks by fusing open-world segmentation with implicit
residual constraints, guided by uncertainty estimates from DINO-Depth features.
Extensive evaluations on KITTI, nuScenes, and self-collected datasets
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to
existing methods.

Conclusion: Alias-Free ViT通过解决混叠问题实现了平移不变性，提升了Vision Transformer的平移鲁棒性。

Abstract: Transformers have emerged as a competitive alternative to convnets in vision
tasks, yet they lack the architectural inductive bias of convnets, which may
hinder their potential performance. Specifically, Vision Transformers (ViTs)
are not translation-invariant and are more sensitive to minor image
translations than standard convnets. Previous studies have shown, however, that
convnets are also not perfectly shift-invariant, due to aliasing in
downsampling and nonlinear layers. Consequently, anti-aliasing approaches have
been proposed to certify convnets' translation robustness. Building on this
line of work, we propose an Alias-Free ViT, which combines two main components.
First, it uses alias-free downsampling and nonlinearities. Second, it uses
linear cross-covariance attention that is shift-equivariant to both integer and
fractional translations, enabling a shift-invariant global representation. Our
model maintains competitive performance in image classification and outperforms
similar-sized models in terms of robustness to adversarial translations.

TL;DR: 提出DAMap方法解决高精地图元素预测中的任务对齐问题，通过距离感知焦点损失、混合损失方案和任务调制可变形注意力提升预测质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在高质量预测方面表现不佳，主要由于任务不对齐问题：1）一对多匹配查询共享相同标签导致不适当的任务标签；2）任务共享采样机制导致次优任务特征

Method: DAMap包含三个组件：距离感知焦点损失(DAFL)为样本分配适当分类标签，混合损失方案(HLS)更好利用DAFL优势，任务调制可变形注意力(TMDA)获取判别性任务特定特征

Result: 在NuScenes和Argoverse2基准测试中，在不同指标、基线、分割、主干网络和训练计划下均实现性能提升

Conclusion: DAMap通过解决任务不对齐问题，有效提高了高精地图元素预测的质量和准确性

Abstract: Predicting High-definition (HD) map elements with high quality (high
classification and localization scores) is crucial to the safety of autonomous
driving vehicles. However, current methods perform poorly in high quality
predictions due to inherent task misalignment. Two main factors are responsible
for misalignment: 1) inappropriate task labels due to one-to-many matching
queries sharing the same labels, and 2) sub-optimal task features due to
task-shared sampling mechanism. In this paper, we reveal two inherent defects
in current methods and develop a novel HD map construction method named DAMap
to address these problems. Specifically, DAMap consists of three components:
Distance-aware Focal Loss (DAFL), Hybrid Loss Scheme (HLS), and Task Modulated
Deformable Attention (TMDA). The DAFL is introduced to assign appropriate
classification labels for one-to-many matching samples. The TMDA is proposed to
obtain discriminative task-specific features. Furthermore, the HLS is proposed
to better utilize the advantages of the DAFL. We perform extensive experiments
and consistently achieve performance improvement on the NuScenes and Argoverse2
benchmarks under different metrics, baselines, splits, backbones, and
schedules. Code will be available at https://github.com/jpdong-xjtu/DAMap.

TL;DR: 提出基于立面图像的多任务学习模型，预测日本建筑的建造年份、结构类型和物业类型，从而推导出结构防火等级（H/T/M）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 日本二手房市场中建筑关键元数据（如建造年份、结构类型）经常缺失或过时，影响灾害风险评估和保险定价。

Method: 使用多任务学习模型从立面图像联合估计建造年份、建筑结构和物业类型，通过基于官方保险标准的规则映射推导防火等级。

Result: 模型在建造年份回归和类别不平衡分类中表现优异，定性分析显示模型能捕捉与建筑年代和材料相关的视觉特征。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了基于图像的可扩展、可解释风险分析系统的可行性，在保险、城市规划和灾害预防方面具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Structural fireproof classification is vital for disaster risk assessment and
insurance pricing in Japan. However, key building metadata such as construction
year and structure type are often missing or outdated, particularly in the
second-hand housing market. This study proposes a multi-task learning model
that predicts these attributes from facade images. The model jointly estimates
the construction year, building structure, and property type, from which the
structural fireproof class - defined as H (non-fireproof), T (semi-fireproof),
or M (fireproof) - is derived via a rule-based mapping based on official
insurance criteria. We trained and evaluated the model using a large-scale
dataset of Japanese residential images, applying rigorous filtering and
deduplication. The model achieved high accuracy in construction-year regression
and robust classification across imbalanced categories. Qualitative analyses
show that it captures visual cues related to building age and materials. Our
approach demonstrates the feasibility of scalable, interpretable, image-based
risk-profiling systems, offering potential applications in insurance, urban
planning, and disaster preparedness.

Method: 提出RoboSVG框架：首先生成多模态指导，然后通过专用生成模块合成候选SVG，最后在数值指导下进行精炼。构建了包含100万个样本的RoboDraw数据集。

Result: 实验表明RoboSVG在查询遵从性和视觉保真度方面表现优异，在文本到SVG、图像到SVG等任务中建立了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: RoboSVG为交互式SVG生成提供了一个有效的统一框架，数据集和源代码将公开。

Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) are fundamental to digital design and robot
control, encoding not only visual structure but also motion paths in
interactive drawings. In this work, we introduce RoboSVG, a unified multimodal
framework for generating interactive SVGs guided by textual, visual, and
numerical signals. Given an input query, the RoboSVG model first produces
multimodal guidance, then synthesizes candidate SVGs through dedicated
generation modules, and finally refines them under numerical guidance to yield
high-quality outputs. To support this framework, we construct RoboDraw, a
large-scale dataset of one million examples, each pairing an SVG generation
condition (e.g., text, image, and partial SVG) with its corresponding
ground-truth SVG code. RoboDraw dataset enables systematic study of four tasks,
including basic generation (Text-to-SVG, Image-to-SVG) and interactive
generation (PartialSVG-to-SVG, PartialImage-to-SVG). Extensive experiments
demonstrate that RoboSVG achieves superior query compliance and visual fidelity
across tasks, establishing a new state of the art in versatile SVG generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出VADTree方法，通过分层粒度感知树结构实现视频异常检测的灵活采样，利用预训练模型知识识别异常事件边界，在无需训练的情况下达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频异常检测方法存在局限性：监督方法需要大量训练数据且缺乏解释性，无训练方法使用固定长度时间窗口难以准确捕捉不同时间跨度的异常。

Method: 使用分层粒度感知树结构进行灵活采样，基于预训练通用事件边界检测模型识别潜在异常边界，通过自适应粗细分层结构和冗余去除构建树结构，结合视觉语言模型和大语言模型进行异常感知和推理。

Result: 在三个挑战性数据集上的实验表明，VADTree在无训练设置下达到最先进性能，同时大幅减少采样的视频片段数量。

Conclusion: VADTree通过分层树结构和多模态模型集成，有效解决了视频异常检测中时间跨度变化的问题，在减少计算成本的同时提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) focuses on identifying anomalies in videos.
Supervised methods demand substantial in-domain training data and fail to
deliver clear explanations for anomalies. In contrast, training-free methods
leverage the knowledge reserves and language interactivity of large pre-trained
models to detect anomalies. However, the current fixed-length temporal window
sampling approaches struggle to accurately capture anomalies with varying
temporal spans. Therefore, we propose VADTree that utilizes a Hierarchical
Granularityaware Tree (HGTree) structure for flexible sampling in VAD. VADTree
leverages the knowledge embedded in a pre-trained Generic Event Boundary
Detection (GEBD) model to characterize potential anomaly event boundaries.
Specifically, VADTree decomposes the video into generic event nodes based on
boundary confidence, and performs adaptive coarse-fine hierarchical structuring
and redundancy removal to construct the HGTree. Then, the multi-dimensional
priors are injected into the visual language models (VLMs) to enhance the
node-wise anomaly perception, and anomaly reasoning for generic event nodes is
achieved via large language models (LLMs). Finally, an inter-cluster node
correlation method is used to integrate the multi-granularity anomaly scores.
Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets demonstrate that VADTree
achieves state-of-the-art performance in training-free settings while
drastically reducing the number of sampled video segments. The code will be
available at https://github.com/wenlongli10/VADTree.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MRAG方法存在静态检索策略、不灵活的模态选择和次优的信息利用问题，导致确定何时检索、选择什么模态以及如何有效利用检索信息三大挑战

Method: 引入Windsock模块进行检索必要性和模态选择的决策，提出DANCE指令调优增强MLLMs利用检索信息的能力，采用自评估方法将问答数据集转换为MRAG训练数据集

Result: 实验表明该方法显著提升生成质量17.07%，同时减少8.95%的检索次数

Conclusion: 所提出的方法有效解决了MRAG中的关键挑战，在提升响应质量的同时降低了计算开销

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) has emerged as a promising
method to generate factual and up-to-date responses of Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating non-parametric knowledge from external
knowledge bases. However, existing MRAG approaches suffer from static retrieval
strategies, inflexible modality selection, and suboptimal utilization of
retrieved information, leading to three critical challenges: determining when
to retrieve, what modality to incorporate, and how to utilize retrieved
information effectively. To address these challenges, we introduce Windsock, a
query-dependent module making decisions on retrieval necessity and modality
selection, effectively reducing computational overhead and improving response
quality. Additionally, we propose Dynamic Noise-Resistance (DANCE) Instruction
Tuning, an adaptive training strategy that enhances MLLMs' ability to utilize
retrieved information while maintaining robustness against noise. Moreover, we
adopt a self-assessment approach leveraging knowledge within MLLMs to convert
question-answering datasets to MRAG training datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves the generation
quality by 17.07% while reducing 8.95% retrieval times.

TL;DR: WaveMAE是一个针对多光谱卫星图像的掩码自编码框架，通过离散小波变换和地理条件位置编码，在遥感任务中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感领域中标注数据稀缺，限制了全监督方法的适用性，需要自监督学习来构建基础模型。

Method: 使用多级离散小波变换分离频率分量，引导编码器学习尺度感知的高频表示；提出地理条件位置编码，通过球谐函数融入地理先验。

Result: 在PANGAEA基准测试的多个下游任务中持续优于先前方法，在分割和回归任务上获得显著提升；轻量级变体仅需26.4%参数即可达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: WaveMAE成为多光谱遥感图像的强大且地理感知的基础模型。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently emerged as a key strategy for
building foundation models in remote sensing, where the scarcity of annotated
data limits the applicability of fully supervised approaches. In this work, we
introduce WaveMAE, a masked autoencoding framework tailored for multispectral
satellite imagery. Unlike conventional pixel-based reconstruction, WaveMAE
leverages a multi-level Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to disentangle
frequency components and guide the encoder toward learning scale-aware
high-frequency representations. We further propose a Geo-conditioned Positional
Encoding (GPE), which incorporates geographical priors via Spherical Harmonics,
encouraging embeddings that respect both semantic and geospatial structure. To
ensure fairness in evaluation, all methods are pretrained on the same dataset
(fMoW-S2) and systematically evaluated on the diverse downstream tasks of the
PANGAEA benchmark, spanning semantic segmentation, regression, change
detection, and multilabel classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that WaveMAE achieves consistent improvements over prior state-of-the-art
approaches, with substantial gains on segmentation and regression benchmarks.
The effectiveness of WaveMAE pretraining is further demonstrated by showing
that even a lightweight variant, containing only 26.4% of the parameters,
achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our results establish WaveMAE as a
strong and geographically informed foundation model for multispectral remote
sensing imagery.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出InstanceGrounded Geometry Transformer (IGGT)，一个端到端的大型统一transformer，用于统一空间重建和实例级上下文理解的知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类自然地将3D世界的几何结构和语义内容视为相互交织的维度，但现有方法通常将低级3D重建和高级空间理解分开处理，忽视了它们之间的关键相互作用，限制了泛化能力和下游任务性能。

Method: 设计3D一致性对比学习策略，通过仅使用2D视觉输入指导IGGT编码包含几何结构和实例基础聚类的统一表示。构建InsScene-15K大规模数据集，包含高质量RGB图像、位姿、深度图和3D一致性实例级掩码标注。

Result: 该表示支持将2D视觉输入一致地提升为具有明确不同对象实例的连贯3D场景。

Conclusion: IGGT通过统一几何结构和实例级理解，解决了现有方法在3D场景分析中的局限性，提高了泛化能力和下游任务性能。

Abstract: Humans naturally perceive the geometric structure and semantic content of a
3D world as intertwined dimensions, enabling coherent and accurate
understanding of complex scenes. However, most prior approaches prioritize
training large geometry models for low-level 3D reconstruction and treat
high-level spatial understanding in isolation, overlooking the crucial
interplay between these two fundamental aspects of 3D-scene analysis, thereby
limiting generalization and leading to poor performance in downstream 3D
understanding tasks. Recent attempts have mitigated this issue by simply
aligning 3D models with specific language models, thus restricting perception
to the aligned model's capacity and limiting adaptability to downstream tasks.
In this paper, we propose InstanceGrounded Geometry Transformer (IGGT), an
end-to-end large unified transformer to unify the knowledge for both spatial
reconstruction and instance-level contextual understanding. Specifically, we
design a 3D-Consistent Contrastive Learning strategy that guides IGGT to encode
a unified representation with geometric structures and instance-grounded
clustering through only 2D visual inputs. This representation supports
consistent lifting of 2D visual inputs into a coherent 3D scene with explicitly
distinct object instances. To facilitate this task, we further construct
InsScene-15K, a large-scale dataset with high-quality RGB images, poses, depth
maps, and 3D-consistent instance-level mask annotations with a novel data
curation pipeline.

Abstract: Cross-view localization and synthesis are two fundamental tasks in cross-view
visual understanding, which deals with cross-view datasets: overhead (satellite
or aerial) and ground-level imagery. These tasks have gained increasing
attention due to their broad applications in autonomous navigation, urban
planning, and augmented reality. Cross-view localization aims to estimate the
geographic position of ground-level images based on information provided by
overhead imagery while cross-view synthesis seeks to generate ground-level
images based on information from the overhead imagery. Both tasks remain
challenging due to significant differences in viewing perspective, resolution,
and occlusion, which are widely embedded in cross-view datasets. Recent years
have witnessed rapid progress driven by the availability of large-scale
datasets and novel approaches. Typically, cross-view localization is formulated
as an image retrieval problem where ground-level features are matched with
tiled overhead images feature, extracted by convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) or vision transformers (ViTs) for cross-view feature embedding.
Cross-view synthesis, on the other hand, seeks to generate ground-level views
based on information from overhead imagery, generally using generative
adversarial networks (GANs) or diffusion models. This paper presents a
comprehensive survey of advances in cross-view localization and synthesis,
reviewing widely used datasets, highlighting key challenges, and providing an
organized overview of state-of-the-art techniques. Furthermore, it discusses
current limitations, offers comparative analyses, and outlines promising
directions for future research. We also include the project page via

Motivation: 解决糖尿病足溃疡检测中公开数据集稀缺和变异性的挑战，以及类别不平衡问题。

Method: 使用ConvNeXt块提取局部特征，结合CBAM和DANet注意力机制，添加Transformer模块增强长距离依赖，并采用数据增强处理类别不平衡。

Result: 在DS1和DS2数据集上，单次实验准确率达0.8961，精度0.9160；4折交叉验证准确率达0.9755，标准差仅0.0031，优于现有CNN和ViT模型。

Conclusion: ConMatFormer为糖尿病足溃疡分类设立了新基准，提供了用于医学图像分析的混合注意力Transformer框架，并通过XAI方法确保决策过程透明可信。

Abstract: Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) detection is a clinically significant yet
challenging task due to the scarcity and variability of publicly available
datasets. To solve these problems, we propose ConMatFormer, a new hybrid deep
learning architecture that combines ConvNeXt blocks, multiple attention
mechanisms convolutional block attention module (CBAM) and dual attention
network (DANet), and transformer modules in a way that works together. This
design facilitates the extraction of better local features and understanding of
the global context, which allows us to model small skin patterns across
different types of DFU very accurately. To address the class imbalance, we used
data augmentation methods. A ConvNeXt block was used to obtain detailed local
features in the initial stages. Subsequently, we compiled the model by adding a
transformer module to enhance long-range dependency. This enabled us to
pinpoint the DFU classes that were underrepresented or constituted minorities.
Tests on the DS1 (DFUC2021) and DS2 (diabetic foot ulcer (DFU)) datasets showed
that ConMatFormer outperformed state-of-the-art (SOTA) convolutional neural
network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) models in terms of accuracy,
reliability, and flexibility. The proposed method achieved an accuracy of
0.8961 and a precision of 0.9160 in a single experiment, which is a significant
improvement over the current standards for classifying DFUs. In addition, by
4-fold cross-validation, the proposed model achieved an accuracy of 0.9755 with
a standard deviation of only 0.0031. We further applied explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) methods, such as Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, and LIME, to
consistently monitor the transparency and trustworthiness of the
decision-making process.. Our findings set a new benchmark for DFU
classification and provide a hybrid attention transformer framework for medical
image analysis.

*Jiaxiang Liu,Jiawei Du,Xiao Liu,Prayag Tiwari,Mingkun Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Self-Calibrated Consistency (SCC)方法，通过语义一致性和空间一致性模块增强CLIP模型的零样本对抗鲁棒性，无需对抗训练即可防御多种攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CLIP模型在零样本场景下对对抗扰动高度脆弱，而传统防御方法依赖带标签数据的对抗微调，限制了在零样本设置中的应用。

Method: SCC包含两个模块：语义一致性利用反攻击预热生成的软伪标签和多视图预测来正则化跨模态对齐；空间一致性通过增强视图对齐扰动视觉预测以稳定推理。

Result: 在22个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，SCC能一致提升CLIP的零样本鲁棒性，同时保持准确率，并可无缝集成到其他VLM中。

Conclusion: SCC展示了从CLIP建立对抗鲁棒范式的巨大潜力，对更广泛的视觉语言领域如BioMedCLIP具有重要意义。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated
strong zero-shot capabilities across diverse domains, yet remain highly
vulnerable to adversarial perturbations that disrupt image-text alignment and
compromise reliability. Existing defenses typically rely on adversarial
fine-tuning with labeled data, limiting their applicability in zero-shot
settings. In this work, we identify two key weaknesses of current CLIP
adversarial attacks -- lack of semantic guidance and vulnerability to view
variations -- collectively termed semantic and viewpoint fragility. To address
these challenges, we propose Self-Calibrated Consistency (SCC), an effective
test-time defense. SCC consists of two complementary modules: Semantic
consistency, which leverages soft pseudo-labels from counterattack warm-up and
multi-view predictions to regularize cross-modal alignment and separate the
target embedding from confusable negatives; and Spatial consistency, aligning
perturbed visual predictions via augmented views to stabilize inference under
adversarial perturbations. Together, these modules form a plug-and-play
inference strategy. Extensive experiments on 22 benchmarks under diverse attack
settings show that SCC consistently improves the zero-shot robustness of CLIP
while maintaining accuracy, and can be seamlessly integrated with other VLMs
for further gains. These findings highlight the great potential of establishing
an adversarially robust paradigm from CLIP, with implications extending to
broader vision-language domains such as BioMedCLIP.

Abstract: Explainability is critical for the clinical adoption of medical visual
question answering (VQA) systems, as physicians require transparent reasoning
to trust AI-generated diagnoses. We present MedXplain-VQA, a comprehensive
framework integrating five explainable AI components to deliver interpretable
medical image analysis. The framework leverages a fine-tuned BLIP-2 backbone,
medical query reformulation, enhanced Grad-CAM attention, precise region
extraction, and structured chain-of-thought reasoning via multi-modal language
models. To evaluate the system, we introduce a medical-domain-specific
framework replacing traditional NLP metrics with clinically relevant
assessments, including terminology coverage, clinical structure quality, and
attention region relevance. Experiments on 500 PathVQA histopathology samples
demonstrate substantial improvements, with the enhanced system achieving a
composite score of 0.683 compared to 0.378 for baseline methods, while
maintaining high reasoning confidence (0.890). Our system identifies 3-5
diagnostically relevant regions per sample and generates structured
explanations averaging 57 words with appropriate clinical terminology. Ablation
studies reveal that query reformulation provides the most significant initial
improvement, while chain-of-thought reasoning enables systematic diagnostic
processes. These findings underscore the potential of MedXplain-VQA as a
robust, explainable medical VQA system. Future work will focus on validation
with medical experts and large-scale clinical datasets to ensure clinical

Conclusion: MAGIC-Talk为说话人脸生成提供了一个鲁棒的解决方案，能够从单张图像保持身份特征，同时确保帧间的平滑过渡。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking face generation has gained significant attention for
applications in digital media and virtual avatars. While recent methods improve
audio-lip synchronization, they often struggle with temporal consistency,
identity preservation, and customization, especially in long video generation.
To address these issues, we propose MAGIC-Talk, a one-shot diffusion-based
framework for customizable and temporally stable talking face generation.
MAGIC-Talk consists of ReferenceNet, which preserves identity and enables
fine-grained facial editing via text prompts, and AnimateNet, which enhances
motion coherence using structured motion priors. Unlike previous methods
requiring multiple reference images or fine-tuning, MAGIC-Talk maintains
identity from a single image while ensuring smooth transitions across frames.
Additionally, a progressive latent fusion strategy is introduced to improve
long-form video quality by reducing motion inconsistencies and flickering.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAGIC-Talk outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in visual quality, identity preservation, and synchronization accuracy,
offering a robust solution for talking face generation.

### [134] [FairJudge: MLLM Judging for Social Attributes and Prompt Image Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22827)
*Zahraa Al Sahili,Maryam Fetanat,Maimuna Nowaz,Ioannis Patras,Matthew Purver*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FairJudge是一个轻量级评估协议，使用多模态LLM作为公平评判者来评估文本到图像系统的公平性，相比传统方法能提供更可靠、可复现的公平性审计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像系统缺乏简单可复现的方法来评估图像与提示的匹配程度以及模型对社会属性的处理，传统代理方法（如人脸分类器和对比相似度）存在奖励表面线索、缺乏校准弃权、遗漏弱可见属性等问题。

Method: 将指令跟随多模态LLM作为公平评判者，使用解释导向的评分标准映射到[-1,1]区间，约束判断为封闭标签集，要求基于可见内容的证据，并在线索不足时强制弃权。

Result: 在FairFace、PaTA、FairCoT等数据集上评估性别、种族、年龄，并扩展到宗教、文化、残疾等属性，在人口统计预测上优于对比和人脸中心基线，同时保持高职业准确性。

Conclusion: FairJudge协议能够实现更可靠、可复现的公平性审计，为文本到图像系统的公平性评估提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) systems lack simple, reproducible ways to evaluate how
well images match prompts and how models treat social attributes. Common
proxies -- face classifiers and contrastive similarity -- reward surface cues,
lack calibrated abstention, and miss attributes only weakly visible (for
example, religion, culture, disability). We present FairJudge, a lightweight
protocol that treats instruction-following multimodal LLMs as fair judges. It
scores alignment with an explanation-oriented rubric mapped to [-1, 1];
constrains judgments to a closed label set; requires evidence grounded in the
visible content; and mandates abstention when cues are insufficient. Unlike
CLIP-only pipelines, FairJudge yields accountable, evidence-aware decisions;
unlike mitigation that alters generators, it targets evaluation fairness. We
evaluate gender, race, and age on FairFace, PaTA, and FairCoT; extend to
religion, culture, and disability; and assess profession correctness and
alignment on IdenProf, FairCoT-Professions, and our new DIVERSIFY-Professions.
We also release DIVERSIFY, a 469-image corpus of diverse, non-iconic scenes.
Across datasets, judge models outperform contrastive and face-centric baselines
on demographic prediction and improve mean alignment while maintaining high
profession accuracy, enabling more reliable, reproducible fairness audits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MediaEval 2025竞赛中商业广告记忆性预测任务，探索多模态方法在广告记忆性分析中的应用。

Method: 使用Gemma-3 LLM作为主干，集成预计算的视觉(ViT)和文本(E5)特征，通过多模态投影进行融合，采用LoRA进行适配，并利用基于专家知识的LLM生成理由提示指导模型。

Result: LLM基系统在最终测试集上相比梯度提升树基线表现出更强的鲁棒性和泛化性能。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的多模态融合方法在广告记忆性预测任务中具有优势，特别是通过专家知识指导的提示策略能有效提升模型性能。

Abstract: This paper addresses the prediction of commercial (brand) memorability as
part of "Subtask 2: Commercial/Ad Memorability" within the "Memorability:
Predicting movie and commercial memorability" task at the MediaEval 2025
workshop competition. We propose a multimodal fusion system with a Gemma-3 LLM
backbone that integrates pre-computed visual (ViT) and textual (E5) features by
multi-modal projections. The model is adapted using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).
A heavily-tuned ensemble of gradient boosted trees serves as a baseline. A key
contribution is the use of LLM-generated rationale prompts, grounded in
expert-derived aspects of memorability, to guide the fusion model. The results
demonstrate that the LLM-based system exhibits greater robustness and
generalization performance on the final test set, compared to the baseline.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了SP-CSVR框架，通过风格-内容解耦和语义对齐来解决大视觉语言模型中的"风格陷阱"问题，提升跨风格语义理解的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大视觉语言模型在跨不同视觉风格时存在"风格陷阱"问题，特别是在上下文学习中，现有方法难以有效解耦风格与内容，阻碍了模型的泛化能力。

Method: SP-CSVR框架包含三个核心组件：跨风格特征编码器（CSFE）用于风格-内容解耦，语义对齐上下文解码器（SAICD）用于少样本风格适应，自适应语义一致性模块（ASCM）通过多任务对比学习确保跨风格语义不变性。

Result: 在具有挑战性的多风格数据集上的广泛实验表明，SP-CSVR在视觉描述、视觉问答和上下文风格适应任务中达到了最先进的性能。消融研究和泛化分析证实了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: SP-CSVR通过风格-内容解耦和语义对齐机制，显著提升了模型在多样化视觉风格下的鲁棒性、泛化能力和效率。

Abstract: The "style trap" poses a significant challenge for Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs), hindering robust semantic understanding across diverse visual
styles, especially in in-context learning (ICL). Existing methods often fail to
effectively decouple style from content, hindering generalization. To address
this, we propose the Semantic-Preserving Cross-Style Visual Reasoner (SP-CSVR),
a novel framework for stable semantic understanding and adaptive cross-style
visual reasoning. SP-CSVR integrates a Cross-Style Feature Encoder (CSFE) for
style-content disentanglement, a Semantic-Aligned In-Context Decoder (SAICD)
for efficient few-shot style adaptation, and an Adaptive Semantic Consistency
Module (ASCM) employing multi-task contrastive learning to enforce cross-style
semantic invariance. Extensive experiments on a challenging multi-style dataset
demonstrate SP-CSVR's state-of-the-art performance across visual captioning,
visual question answering, and in-context style adaptation. Comprehensive
evaluations, including ablation studies and generalization analysis, confirm
SP-CSVR's efficacy in enhancing robustness, generalization, and efficiency
across diverse visual styles.

TL;DR: FastJAM是一种基于图的快速联合对齐方法，通过图神经网络聚合关键点对应关系，在几秒钟内完成图像对齐，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联合对齐方法通常需要长时间训练、大容量模型和大量超参数调优，计算复杂度高。

Method: 利用现成图像匹配器计算成对匹配，通过快速非参数聚类构建图表示关键点关系，使用图神经网络传播和聚合对应关系，通过图像级池化预测单应性参数。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，FastJAM在对齐质量上优于现有现代JA方法，同时将计算时间从小时/分钟级别减少到秒级别。

Conclusion: FastJAM提供了一种快速有效的联合对齐解决方案，无需正则化项和相关的超参数调优，大大降低了计算复杂度。

Abstract: Joint Alignment (JA) of images aims to align a collection of images into a
unified coordinate frame, such that semantically-similar features appear at
corresponding spatial locations. Most existing approaches often require long
training times, large-capacity models, and extensive hyperparameter tuning. We
introduce FastJAM, a rapid, graph-based method that drastically reduces the
computational complexity of joint alignment tasks. FastJAM leverages pairwise
matches computed by an off-the-shelf image matcher, together with a rapid
nonparametric clustering, to construct a graph representing intra- and
inter-image keypoint relations. A graph neural network propagates and
aggregates these correspondences, efficiently predicting per-image homography
parameters via image-level pooling. Utilizing an inverse-compositional loss,
that eliminates the need for a regularization term over the predicted
transformations (and thus also obviates the hyperparameter tuning associated
with such terms), FastJAM performs image JA quickly and effectively.
Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that FastJAM achieves
results better than existing modern JA methods in terms of alignment quality,
while reducing computation time from hours or minutes to mere seconds. Our code
is available at our project webpage, https://bgu-cs-vil.github.io/FastJAM/

*Lexiang Xiong,Chengyu Liu,Jingwen Ye,Yan Liu,Yuecong Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Semantic Surgery框架，一种无需训练、零样本的概念擦除方法，直接在文本嵌入层面操作，通过向量减法中和目标概念影响，在保持图像质量的同时实现高效概念擦除。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型的概念擦除方法往往损害生成质量，需要一种既能有效擦除有害内容又能保持图像质量的新方法。

Method: 在扩散过程前直接操作文本嵌入，动态估计目标概念存在性并进行校准向量减法，包含共现编码模块和视觉反馈循环来处理多概念擦除和潜在概念持久性问题。

Result: 在物体、显式内容、艺术风格和多名人擦除任务中显著优于现有方法，实现93.58 H-score的物体擦除，显式内容减少到仅1个实例，风格擦除H_a达到8.09且无质量下降。

Conclusion: Semantic Surgery作为无需训练的方法，能够动态适应每个提示，提供精确干预，同时可作为内置威胁检测系统，为更安全的文本到图像生成提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: Concept erasure in text-to-image diffusion models is crucial for mitigating
harmful content, yet existing methods often compromise generative quality. We
introduce Semantic Surgery, a novel training-free, zero-shot framework for
concept erasure that operates directly on text embeddings before the diffusion
process. It dynamically estimates the presence of target concepts in a prompt
and performs a calibrated vector subtraction to neutralize their influence at
the source, enhancing both erasure completeness and locality. The framework
includes a Co-Occurrence Encoding module for robust multi-concept erasure and a
visual feedback loop to address latent concept persistence. As a training-free
method, Semantic Surgery adapts dynamically to each prompt, ensuring precise
interventions. Extensive experiments on object, explicit content, artistic
style, and multi-celebrity erasure tasks show our method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. We achieve superior completeness and
robustness while preserving locality and image quality (e.g., 93.58 H-score in
object erasure, reducing explicit content to just 1 instance, and 8.09 H_a in
style erasure with no quality degradation). This robustness also allows our
framework to function as a built-in threat detection system, offering a
practical solution for safer text-to-image generation.

*Yang Zhang,Qianyu Zhou,Farhad Imani,Jiong Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个零样本导向的风力涡轮机叶片检测框架，结合检索增强生成(RAG)和视觉语言模型(VLM)，无需任务特定训练即可检测罕见或新出现的损伤类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 风力涡轮机叶片在恶劣环境中运行，需要及时检测损伤以防止故障。传统基于无人机和深度学习的方法依赖大量标注数据，难以检测罕见或演化中的损伤类型。

Method: 构建包含技术文档、参考图像和领域指南的多模态知识库，使用混合文本-图像检索器结合关键词感知重排来组装最相关上下文，在推理时注入领域知识。

Result: 在30张标记叶片图像上评估，RAG增强的VLM正确分类所有样本，而相同VLM无检索时准确率和精度都较差。框架优势在于可解释性和泛化性。

Conclusion: 该研究为工业检测提供了一种数据高效的解决方案，减少了对大量标注数据集的依赖。

Abstract: Wind turbine blades operate in harsh environments, making timely damage
detection essential for preventing failures and optimizing maintenance.
Drone-based inspection and deep learning are promising, but typically depend on
large, labeled datasets, which limit their ability to detect rare or evolving
damage types. To address this, we propose a zero-shot-oriented inspection
framework that integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with
Vision-Language Models (VLM). A multimodal knowledge base is constructed,
comprising technical documentation, representative reference images, and
domain-specific guidelines. A hybrid text-image retriever with keyword-aware
reranking assembles the most relevant context to condition the VLM at
inference, injecting domain knowledge without task-specific training. We
evaluate the framework on 30 labeled blade images covering diverse damage
categories. Although the dataset is small due to the difficulty of acquiring
verified blade imagery, it covers multiple representative defect types. On this
test set, the RAG-grounded VLM correctly classified all samples, whereas the
same VLM without retrieval performed worse in both accuracy and precision. We
further compare against open-vocabulary baselines and incorporate uncertainty
Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals to account for the small-sample setting.
Ablation studies indicate that the key advantage of the framework lies in
explainability and generalizability: retrieved references ground the reasoning
process and enable the detection of previously unseen defects by leveraging
domain knowledge rather than relying solely on visual cues. This research
contributes a data-efficient solution for industrial inspection that reduces
dependence on extensive labeled datasets.

Conclusion: 该数据集为机器学习社区提供了牧场生物量估计的挑战任务，有助于促进精准放牧管理技术的发展。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of pasture biomass is important for decision-making in
livestock production systems. Estimates of pasture biomass can be used to
manage stocking rates to maximise pasture utilisation, while minimising the
risk of overgrazing and promoting overall system health. We present a
comprehensive dataset of 1,162 annotated top-view images of pastures collected
across 19 locations in Australia. The images were taken across multiple seasons
and include a range of temperate pasture species. Each image captures a 70cm *
30cm quadrat and is paired with on-ground measurements including biomass sorted
by component (green, dead, and legume fraction), vegetation height, and
Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Active Optical Sensors
(AOS). The multidimensional nature of the data, which combines visual,
spectral, and structural information, opens up new possibilities for advancing
the use of precision grazing management. The dataset is released and hosted in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如LangSplat需要为每个场景训练特定的语言自编码器进行特征压缩，这造成了昂贵的场景特定优化瓶颈，限制了部署的可扩展性。

Method: 使用在ScanNet数据集上预训练的通用自编码器替代场景特定自编码器，为任何新场景使用固定的紧凑潜在空间表示语言特征，无需场景特定训练。

Result: 整个语言场构建过程效率显著提升，同时查询性能与原始LangSplat方法相当或更好，通过MSE和余弦相似度验证了表示保真度。

Conclusion: 通用嵌入能够高效准确地支持新3D场景中的开放词汇查询，为可扩展的实时交互3D AI应用铺平道路。

Abstract: Modeling open-vocabulary language fields in 3D is essential for intuitive
human-AI interaction and querying within physical environments.
State-of-the-art approaches, such as LangSplat, leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting
to efficiently construct these language fields, encoding features distilled
from high-dimensional models like CLIP. However, this efficiency is currently
offset by the requirement to train a scene-specific language autoencoder for
feature compression, introducing a costly, per-scene optimization bottleneck
that hinders deployment scalability. In this work, we introduce Gen-LangSplat,
that eliminates this requirement by replacing the scene-wise autoencoder with a
generalized autoencoder, pre-trained extensively on the large-scale ScanNet
dataset. This architectural shift enables the use of a fixed, compact latent
space for language features across any new scene without any scene-specific
training. By removing this dependency, our entire language field construction
process achieves a efficiency boost while delivering querying performance
comparable to, or exceeding, the original LangSplat method. To validate our
design choice, we perform a thorough ablation study empirically determining the
optimal latent embedding dimension and quantifying representational fidelity
using Mean Squared Error and cosine similarity between the original and
reprojected 512-dimensional CLIP embeddings. Our results demonstrate that
generalized embeddings can efficiently and accurately support open-vocabulary
querying in novel 3D scenes, paving the way for scalable, real-time interactive
3D AI applications.

TL;DR: 提出了位置保持嵌入(PPE)方法，在视觉token压缩过程中保持时空结构，通过解耦编码3D位置信息，使压缩token能够封装来自多个原始token的不同位置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的token合并方法虽然减少了序列长度，但经常破坏空间布局和时间连续性，因为它们忽略了位置关系。

Method: PPE是一种参数无关的通用操作符，在token维度上显式引入解耦的3D位置编码，支持级联聚类策略进行渐进式token压缩。

Result: 在多个视觉语言基准测试中，包括MMBench、TextVQA和VideoMME，PPE实现了2%~5%的持续改进。

Conclusion: 保持位置线索对于高效有效的MLLM推理至关重要。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on
vision-language tasks, yet often suffer from inefficiencies due to redundant
visual tokens. Existing token merging methods reduce sequence length but
frequently disrupt spatial layouts and temporal continuity by disregarding
positional relationships. In this work, we propose a novel encoding operator
dubbed as \textbf{P}ositional \textbf{P}reservation \textbf{E}mbedding
(\textbf{PPE}), which has the main hallmark of preservation of spatiotemporal
structure during visual token compression. PPE explicitly introduces the
disentangled encoding of 3D positions in the token dimension, enabling each
compressed token to encapsulate different positions from multiple original
tokens. Furthermore, we show that PPE can effectively support cascade
clustering -- a progressive token compression strategy that leads to better
performance retention. PPE is a parameter-free and generic operator that can be
seamlessly integrated into existing token merging methods without any
adjustments. Applied to state-of-the-art token merging framework, PPE achieves
consistent improvements of $2\%\sim5\%$ across multiple vision-language
benchmarks, including MMBench (general vision understanding), TextVQA (layout
understanding) and VideoMME (temporal understanding). These results demonstrate
that preserving positional cues is critical for efficient and effective MLLM
reasoning.

Motivation: 测试生物特征统计不相关的历史假设，探索不同生物特征之间的相关性。

Method: 使用274名受试者的约10万张指纹和7千张虹膜图像，训练ResNet-50和Vision Transformer双编码器架构，通过对比损失最小化同一受试者图像间的差异。

Result: 虹膜ResNet架构在虹膜-虹膜匹配中达到91% ROC AUC，证明左右虹膜相关；指纹模型重现了先前研究的正相关；跨模态匹配仅略高于随机水平。

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了生物特征独立性的假设，未来计划扩展到其他生物特征，需要更多数据和更复杂的流程来获得有说服力的跨模态匹配结果。

Abstract: There has been a historic assumption that the biometrics of an individual are
statistically uncorrelated. We test this assumption by training Bi-Encoder
networks on three verification tasks, including fingerprint-to-fingerprint
matching, iris-to-iris matching, and cross-modal fingerprint-to-iris matching
using 274 subjects with $\sim$100k fingerprints and 7k iris images. We trained
ResNet-50 and Vision Transformer backbones in Bi-Encoder architectures such
that the contrastive loss between images sampled from the same individual is
minimized. The iris ResNet architecture reaches 91 ROC AUC score for
iris-to-iris matching, providing clear evidence that the left and right irises
of an individual are correlated. Fingerprint models reproduce the positive
intra-subject suggested by prior work in this space. This is the first work
attempting to use Vision Transformers for this matching. Cross-modal matching
rises only slightly above chance, which suggests that more data and a more
sophisticated pipeline is needed to obtain compelling results. These findings
continue challenge independence assumptions of biometrics and we plan to extend
this work to other biometrics in the future. Code available:

TL;DR: 提出了一种可切换的令牌特定码本量化方法，用于人脸图像压缩，通过为不同图像类别学习不同的码本组，并为每个令牌分配独立码本，在低比特率下提升重建性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于码本的解决方案使用全局共享码本，但忽略了人脸图像中类别特定的相关性以及令牌间的语义差异，导致在低比特率下性能不佳。

Method: 学习不同图像类别的码本组，为每个令牌分配独立码本，通过少量比特记录每个令牌所属的码本组，从而在降低每个码本组大小时减少损失。

Result: 在0.05 bpp下，重建图像的平均识别准确率达到93.51%。

Conclusion: 该方法可集成到任何现有的基于码本的表征学习方法中，有效提升了人脸图像压缩的重建性能。

Abstract: With the ever-increasing volume of visual data, the efficient and lossless
transmission, along with its subsequent interpretation and understanding, has
become a critical bottleneck in modern information systems. The emerged
codebook-based solution utilize a globally shared codebook to quantize and
dequantize each token, controlling the bpp by adjusting the number of tokens or
the codebook size. However, for facial images, which are rich in attributes,
such global codebook strategies overlook both the category-specific
correlations within images and the semantic differences among tokens, resulting
in suboptimal performance, especially at low bpp. Motivated by these
observations, we propose a Switchable Token-Specific Codebook Quantization for
face image compression, which learns distinct codebook groups for different
image categories and assigns an independent codebook to each token. By
recording the codebook group to which each token belongs with a small number of
bits, our method can reduce the loss incurred when decreasing the size of each
codebook group. This enables a larger total number of codebooks under a lower
overall bpp, thereby enhancing the expressive capability and improving
reconstruction performance. Owing to its generalizable design, our method can
be integrated into any existing codebook-based representation learning approach
and has demonstrated its effectiveness on face recognition datasets, achieving
an average accuracy of 93.51% for reconstructed images at 0.05 bpp.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有统一多模态模型需要从头训练且计算资源消耗大，本文旨在通过融合公开的专用模型来更高效地获得竞争性性能。

Method: 保留原始模型块，同时在网络中交错插入多模态自注意力块，实现双融合机制，既保留基础模型优势又促进语义表示与空间信号的协同融合。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异：GenEval 0.91（组合文本到图像生成），DPG-Bench 82.16（复杂文本到图像生成），GEditBench 6.06，ImgEdit-Bench 3.77（图像编辑）。

Conclusion: 通过战略性地融合公开模型，可以在少量训练数据下实现强大的多模态性能，为统一多模态建模的未来研究提供支持。

Abstract: Unified multimodal models have recently shown remarkable gains in both
capability and versatility, yet most leading systems are still trained from
scratch and require substantial computational resources. In this paper, we show
that competitive performance can be obtained far more efficiently by
strategically fusing publicly available models specialized for either
generation or understanding. Our key design is to retain the original blocks
while additionally interleaving multimodal self-attention blocks throughout the
networks. This double fusion mechanism (1) effectively enables rich multi-modal
fusion while largely preserving the original strengths of the base models, and
(2) catalyzes synergistic fusion of high-level semantic representations from
the understanding encoder with low-level spatial signals from the generation
encoder. By training with only ~ 35B tokens, this approach achieves strong
results across multiple benchmarks: 0.91 on GenEval for compositional
text-to-image generation, 82.16 on DPG-Bench for complex text-to-image
generation, 6.06 on GEditBench, and 3.77 on ImgEdit-Bench for image editing. By
fully releasing the entire suite of code, model weights, and datasets, we hope
to support future research on unified multimodal modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的免训练视频编辑模型在处理职业相关提示时容易陷入性别刻板印象，需要解决职业相关的性别偏见问题。

Method: 通过从少数群体表示中提取公平性嵌入，将去偏置标记软注入文本编码器；在时间自注意力和跨注意力中集成公平性调制，使用区域约束注意力掩码和时间衰减权重来增强时间一致性。

Result: 在FairVE基准测试中，FAME实现了更强的公平性对齐和语义保真度，超越了现有的视频编辑基线方法。

Conclusion: FAME框架有效减轻了视频编辑中的职业性别偏见，同时保持了良好的时间一致性和提示对齐效果。

Abstract: Training-free video editing (VE) models tend to fall back on gender
stereotypes when rendering profession-related prompts. We propose \textbf{FAME}
for \textit{Fairness-aware Attention-modulated Video Editing} that mitigates
profession-related gender biases while preserving prompt alignment and temporal
consistency for coherent VE. We derive fairness embeddings from existing
minority representations by softly injecting debiasing tokens into the text
encoder. Simultaneously, FAME integrates fairness modulation into both temporal
self attention and prompt-to-region cross attention to mitigate the motion
corruption and temporal inconsistency caused by directly introducing fairness
cues. For temporal self attention, FAME introduces a region constrained
attention mask combined with time decay weighting, which enhances intra-region
coherence while suppressing irrelevant inter-region interactions. For cross
attention, it reweights tokens to region matching scores by incorporating
fairness sensitive similarity masks derived from debiasing prompt embeddings.
Together, these modulations keep fairness-sensitive semantics tied to the right
visual regions and prevent temporal drift across frames. Extensive experiments
on new VE fairness-oriented benchmark \textit{FairVE} demonstrate that FAME
achieves stronger fairness alignment and semantic fidelity, surpassing existing
VE baselines.

Abstract: Foundation models have transformed natural language processing and computer
vision, and their impact is now reshaping remote sensing image analysis. With
powerful generalization and transfer learning capabilities, they align
naturally with the multimodal, multi-resolution, and multi-temporal
characteristics of remote sensing data. To address unique challenges in the
field, multimodal geospatial foundation models (GFMs) have emerged as a
dedicated research frontier. This survey delivers a comprehensive review of
multimodal GFMs from a modality-driven perspective, covering five core visual
and vision-language modalities. We examine how differences in imaging physics
and data representation shape interaction design, and we analyze key techniques
for alignment, integration, and knowledge transfer to tackle modality
heterogeneity, distribution shifts, and semantic gaps. Advances in training
paradigms, architectures, and task-specific adaptation strategies are
systematically assessed alongside a wealth of emerging benchmarks.
Representative multimodal visual and vision-language GFMs are evaluated across
ten downstream tasks, with insights into their architectures, performance, and
application scenarios. Real-world case studies, spanning land cover mapping,
agricultural monitoring, disaster response, climate studies, and geospatial
intelligence, demonstrate the practical potential of GFMs. Finally, we outline
pressing challenges in domain generalization, interpretability, efficiency, and
privacy, and chart promising avenues for future research.

TL;DR: VALA提出了一种变分对齐模块，通过自适应选择关键帧并将其潜在特征压缩为语义锚点，实现一致的视频编辑，无需训练即可集成到基于文本到图像的视频编辑模型中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有训练免费视频编辑方法依赖启发式帧选择来保持DDIM反演的时间一致性，这会引入人工偏差并降低端到端推理的可扩展性。

Method: VALA采用变分对齐框架和对比学习目标，自适应选择关键帧并将其潜在特征压缩为语义锚点，以保持内容一致性和时间连贯性。

Result: 在真实世界视频编辑基准测试中，VALA在反演保真度、编辑质量和时间一致性方面达到最先进性能，同时比先前方法更高效。

Conclusion: VALA通过变分对齐有效解决了训练免费视频编辑中的时间一致性问题，实现了高质量、高效且一致的视频编辑效果。

Abstract: Recent advances in training-free video editing have enabled lightweight and
precise cross-frame generation by leveraging pre-trained text-to-image
diffusion models. However, existing methods often rely on heuristic frame
selection to maintain temporal consistency during DDIM inversion, which
introduces manual bias and reduces the scalability of end-to-end inference. In
this paper, we propose~\textbf{VALA} (\textbf{V}ariational \textbf{A}lignment
for \textbf{L}atent \textbf{A}nchors), a variational alignment module that
adaptively selects key frames and compresses their latent features into
semantic anchors for consistent video editing. To learn meaningful assignments,
VALA propose a variational framework with a contrastive learning objective.
Therefore, it can transform cross-frame latent representations into compressed
latent anchors that preserve both content and temporal coherence. Our method
can be fully integrated into training-free text-to-image based video editing
models. Extensive experiments on real-world video editing benchmarks show that
VALA achieves state-of-the-art performance in inversion fidelity, editing
quality, and temporal consistency, while offering improved efficiency over
prior methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有占据中心方法对标注占据数据依赖性强的问题，当前标注占据数据仍然稀缺，限制了生成模型的性能。

Method: 采用时空解耦架构支持4D动态占据的高保真空间扩展和时间预测；提出基于高斯泼溅的稀疏点图渲染策略增强多视角视频生成；使用传感器感知嵌入策略显式建模LiDAR传感器特性。

Conclusion: 通过构建大规模数据集和统一框架，成功实现了高质量的驾驶场景生成，为自动驾驶感知和规划评估提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Driving scene generation is a critical domain for autonomous driving,
enabling downstream applications, including perception and planning evaluation.
Occupancy-centric methods have recently achieved state-of-the-art results by
offering consistent conditioning across frames and modalities; however, their
performance heavily depends on annotated occupancy data, which still remains
scarce. To overcome this limitation, we curate Nuplan-Occ, the largest semantic
occupancy dataset to date, constructed from the widely used Nuplan benchmark.
Its scale and diversity facilitate not only large-scale generative modeling but
also autonomous driving downstream applications. Based on this dataset, we
develop a unified framework that jointly synthesizes high-quality semantic
occupancy, multi-view videos, and LiDAR point clouds. Our approach incorporates
a spatio-temporal disentangled architecture to support high-fidelity spatial
expansion and temporal forecasting of 4D dynamic occupancy. To bridge modal
gaps, we further propose two novel techniques: a Gaussian splatting-based
sparse point map rendering strategy that enhances multi-view video generation,
and a sensor-aware embedding strategy that explicitly models LiDAR sensor
properties for realistic multi-LiDAR simulation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves superior generation fidelity and
scalability compared to existing approaches, and validates its practical value
in downstream tasks. Repo:

Abstract: Recent text-to-image models have revolutionized image generation, but they
still struggle with maintaining concept consistency across generated images.
While existing works focus on character consistency, they often overlook the
crucial role of scenes in storytelling, which restricts their creativity in
practice. This paper introduces scene-oriented story generation, addressing two
key challenges: (i) scene planning, where current methods fail to ensure
scene-level narrative coherence by relying solely on text descriptions, and
(ii) scene consistency, which remains largely unexplored in terms of
maintaining scene consistency across multiple stories. We propose
SceneDecorator, a training-free framework that employs VLM-Guided Scene
Planning to ensure narrative coherence across different scenes in a
``global-to-local'' manner, and Long-Term Scene-Sharing Attention to maintain
long-term scene consistency and subject diversity across generated stories.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of SceneDecorator,
highlighting its potential to unleash creativity in the fields of arts, films,
and games.

*Md Mostafijur Rahman,Radu Marculescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出LoMix模块，通过可学习的权重混合U型网络中多尺度的logits输出，自动发现最有用的尺度组合和融合算子，提升分割性能且无推理开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有U型网络训练时要么只监督最终输出，要么对所有尺度使用相同权重，没有探索混合尺度的互补信息。

Method: 使用四种轻量级融合算子（加法、乘法、拼接、注意力加权）混合多尺度logits，通过可学习的softplus损失权重共同优化网络参数和融合策略。

Result: 在Synapse 8-organ数据集上，相比单输出监督DICE提升4.2%，相比深度监督提升2.2%，在数据稀缺时优势更明显（+9.23%）。

Conclusion: 可学习的加权多尺度融合方法具有广泛泛化性，同时保持数据高效、完全可解释且推理时无额外开销。

Abstract: U-shaped networks output logits at multiple spatial scales, each capturing a
different blend of coarse context and fine detail. Yet, training still treats
these logits in isolation - either supervising only the final,
highest-resolution logits or applying deep supervision with identical loss
weights at every scale - without exploring mixed-scale combinations.
Consequently, the decoder output misses the complementary cues that arise only
when coarse and fine predictions are fused. To address this issue, we introduce
LoMix (Logits Mixing), a NAS-inspired, differentiable plug-and-play module that
generates new mixed-scale outputs and learns how exactly each of them should
guide the training process. More precisely, LoMix mixes the multi-scale decoder
logits with four lightweight fusion operators: addition, multiplication,
concatenation, and attention-based weighted fusion, yielding a rich set of
synthetic mutant maps. Every original or mutant map is given a softplus loss
weight that is co-optimized with network parameters, mimicking a one-step
architecture search that automatically discovers the most useful scales,
mixtures, and operators. Plugging LoMix into recent U-shaped architectures
(i.e., PVT-V2-B2 backbone with EMCAD decoder) on Synapse 8-organ dataset
improves DICE by +4.2% over single-output supervision, +2.2% over deep
supervision, and +1.5% over equally weighted additive fusion, all with zero
inference overhead. When training data are scarce (e.g., one or two labeled
scans), the advantage grows to +9.23%, underscoring LoMix's data efficiency.
Across four benchmarks and diverse U-shaped networks, LoMiX improves DICE by up
to +13.5% over single-output supervision, confirming that learnable weighted
mixed-scale fusion generalizes broadly while remaining data efficient, fully
interpretable, and overhead-free at inference. Our code is available at
https://github.com/SLDGroup/LoMix.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoMo是一个用于文本到视频生成的组合运动定制框架，能够在一个视频中合成多个不同的运动，解决了现有方法在复杂多主体运动场景中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到视频模型在生成多样场景方面表现出色，但在精确运动控制方面存在不足，特别是在处理复杂多主体运动时。现有的单运动定制方法在组合场景中失败，主要由于运动-外观纠缠和无效的多运动混合问题。

Method: CoMo采用两阶段方法：1）单运动学习阶段，通过静态-动态解耦调优范式将运动与外观分离，学习运动特定模块；2）多运动组合阶段，通过即插即用的分治策略，在去噪过程中空间隔离不同运动的影响，无需额外训练即可组合学习到的运动。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，CoMo实现了最先进的性能，显著提升了可控视频生成的能力。作者还为此新领域引入了新的基准和评估指标来评估多运动保真度和混合效果。

Conclusion: CoMo框架有效解决了文本到视频生成中的组合运动定制问题，通过解耦运动和外观以及空间隔离策略，成功实现了多个不同运动在单一视频中的高质量合成。

Abstract: While recent text-to-video models excel at generating diverse scenes, they
struggle with precise motion control, particularly for complex, multi-subject
motions. Although methods for single-motion customization have been developed
to address this gap, they fail in compositional scenarios due to two primary
challenges: motion-appearance entanglement and ineffective multi-motion
blending. This paper introduces CoMo, a novel framework for
$\textbf{compositional motion customization}$ in text-to-video generation,
enabling the synthesis of multiple, distinct motions within a single video.
CoMo addresses these issues through a two-phase approach. First, in the
single-motion learning phase, a static-dynamic decoupled tuning paradigm
disentangles motion from appearance to learn a motion-specific module. Second,
in the multi-motion composition phase, a plug-and-play divide-and-merge
strategy composes these learned motions without additional training by
spatially isolating their influence during the denoising process. To facilitate
research in this new domain, we also introduce a new benchmark and a novel
evaluation metric designed to assess multi-motion fidelity and blending.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoMo achieves state-of-the-art
performance, significantly advancing the capabilities of controllable video
generation. Our project page is at https://como6.github.io/.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的几何和属性增强框架UGAE，通过后几何增强、前属性增强和后属性增强三个核心组件，显著提升了点云压缩的质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 点云的有损压缩虽然降低了存储和传输成本，但不可避免地导致几何结构和属性信息的不可逆失真。为了解决这些问题，需要开发能够同时提升几何和属性质量的增强方法。

Method: UGAE框架包含三个核心组件：1) PoGE使用基于Transformer的稀疏卷积U-Net通过预测体素占用概率来高精度重建几何结构；2) PAE采用增强几何引导的重新着色策略，使用细节感知KNN方法实现准确重新着色；3) PoAE使用带加权MSE损失的属性残差预测网络来增强高频区域质量。

Result: 在8iVFB、Owlii和MVUB三个基准数据集上显著优于现有方法。与最新的G-PCC测试模型相比，在D1度量下几何平均BD-PSNR增益达9.98dB，BD比特率节省90.98%；属性Y分量的BD-PSNR改善3.67dB，BD比特率节省56.88%。感知质量也显著提升。

Conclusion: UGAE框架通过统一的几何和属性增强方法，在点云压缩中实现了显著的性能提升，为高质量点云压缩提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Lossy compression of point clouds reduces storage and transmission costs;
however, it inevitably leads to irreversible distortion in geometry structure
and attribute information. To address these issues, we propose a unified
geometry and attribute enhancement (UGAE) framework, which consists of three
core components: post-geometry enhancement (PoGE), pre-attribute enhancement
(PAE), and post-attribute enhancement (PoAE). In PoGE, a Transformer-based
sparse convolutional U-Net is used to reconstruct the geometry structure with
high precision by predicting voxel occupancy probabilities. Building on the
refined geometry structure, PAE introduces an innovative enhanced
geometry-guided recoloring strategy, which uses a detail-aware K-Nearest
Neighbors (DA-KNN) method to achieve accurate recoloring and effectively
preserve high-frequency details before attribute compression. Finally, at the
decoder side, PoAE uses an attribute residual prediction network with a
weighted mean squared error (W-MSE) loss to enhance the quality of
high-frequency regions while maintaining the fidelity of low-frequency regions.
UGAE significantly outperformed existing methods on three benchmark datasets:
8iVFB, Owlii, and MVUB. Compared to the latest G-PCC test model (TMC13v29),
UGAE achieved an average BD-PSNR gain of 9.98 dB and 90.98% BD-bitrate savings
for geometry under the D1 metric, as well as a 3.67 dB BD-PSNR improvement with
56.88% BD-bitrate savings for attributes on the Y component. Additionally, it
improved perceptual quality significantly.

TL;DR: 提出了M³T2IBench基准和AlignScore评估指标，用于评估文本到图像生成模型在复杂多实例场景下的图像-文本对齐能力，并提出了无需训练的Revise-Then-Enforce后编辑方法来提升对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型在复杂提示（特别是同一类别多个不同实例）下的图像-文本对齐评估存在不足，要么场景过于简单，要么评估指标与人类评价相关性差。

Method: 构建大规模多类别、多实例、多关系的M³T2IBench基准，开发基于目标检测的AlignScore评估指标，并提出训练无关的Revise-Then-Enforce后编辑方法。

Result: 当前开源文本到图像模型在该挑战性基准上表现不佳，而提出的后编辑方法能在多种扩散模型中普遍提升图像-文本对齐效果。

Conclusion: M³T2IBench和AlignScore为复杂文本到图像生成提供了更好的评估框架，Revise-Then-Enforce方法能有效提升模型性能。

Abstract: Text-to-image models are known to struggle with generating images that
perfectly align with textual prompts. Several previous studies have focused on
evaluating image-text alignment in text-to-image generation. However, these
evaluations either address overly simple scenarios, especially overlooking the
difficulty of prompts with multiple different instances belonging to the same
category, or they introduce metrics that do not correlate well with human
evaluation. In this study, we introduce M$^3$T2IBench, a large-scale,
multi-category, multi-instance, multi-relation along with an
object-detection-based evaluation metric, $AlignScore$, which aligns closely
with human evaluation. Our findings reveal that current open-source
text-to-image models perform poorly on this challenging benchmark.
Additionally, we propose the Revise-Then-Enforce approach to enhance image-text
alignment. This training-free post-editing method demonstrates improvements in
image-text alignment across a broad range of diffusion models. \footnote{Our
code and data has been released in supplementary material and will be made

Result: 使用UniAIDet对各种检测方法进行全面评估，回答了关于泛化能力和检测与定位关系的三个关键研究问题。

Conclusion: 该基准和分析为未来研究提供了坚实基础，有助于推进AI生成图像检测领域的发展。

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of image generative models, the authenticity of
digital images has become a significant concern. While existing studies have
proposed various methods for detecting AI-generated content, current benchmarks
are limited in their coverage of diverse generative models and image
categories, often overlooking end-to-end image editing and artistic images. To
address these limitations, we introduce UniAIDet, a unified and comprehensive
benchmark that includes both photographic and artistic images. UniAIDet covers
a wide range of generative models, including text-to-image, image-to-image,
image inpainting, image editing, and deepfake models. Using UniAIDet, we
conduct a comprehensive evaluation of various detection methods and answer
three key research questions regarding generalization capability and the
relation between detection and localization. Our benchmark and analysis provide
a robust foundation for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归模型在图像生成中计算密集且样本多样性有限，需要更高效的架构来解决这些问题。

Method: 设计多尺度层次模块，采用嵌套自回归架构，其中较大尺度模块以前一个较小尺度模块的输出为条件，每个模块内部使用另一个自回归结构生成token块，并融入流匹配损失和训练目标协调多尺度模块。

Result: NestAR在保持竞争力的图像生成性能的同时，显著降低了计算成本。

Conclusion: 嵌套自回归架构通过多尺度层次设计有效降低了计算复杂度并提高了图像多样性，为高效图像生成提供了可行方案。

Abstract: AutoRegressive (AR) models have demonstrated competitive performance in image
generation, achieving results comparable to those of diffusion models. However,
their token-by-token image generation mechanism remains computationally
intensive and existing solutions such as VAR often lead to limited sample
diversity. In this work, we propose a Nested AutoRegressive~(NestAR) model,
which proposes nested AutoRegressive architectures in generating images. NestAR
designs multi-scale modules in a hierarchical order. These different scaled
modules are constructed in an AR architecture, where one larger-scale module is
conditioned on outputs from its previous smaller-scale module. Within each
module, NestAR uses another AR structure to generate ``patches'' of tokens. The
proposed nested AR architecture reduces the overall complexity from
$\mathcal{O}(n)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ in generating $n$ image tokens, as
well as increases image diversities. NestAR further incorporates flow matching
loss to use continuous tokens, and develops objectives to coordinate these
multi-scale modules in model training. NestAR achieves competitive image
generation performance while significantly lowering computational cost.

TL;DR: HieraMamba是一个用于视频时序定位的分层架构，通过Anchor-MambaPooling块和多粒度对比学习，在长视频中实现了精确的时间定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理长视频时，往往因过度下采样或依赖固定窗口而牺牲时间保真度，需要一种能同时捕捉全局上下文和细粒度时间细节的解决方案。

Method: 使用分层架构和Anchor-MambaPooling块，通过Mamba的选择性扫描生成多粒度锚点标记，结合锚点条件和段池化对比损失来保持局部细节和全局区分性。

Result: 在Ego4D-NLQ、MAD和TACoS数据集上达到了新的最先进水平，证明了在长未修剪视频中精确、时间保真的定位能力。

Conclusion: HieraMamba通过分层设计和对比学习目标，有效解决了长视频时序定位中的时间保真度问题，实现了优越的定位性能。

Abstract: Video temporal grounding, the task of localizing the start and end times of a
natural language query in untrimmed video, requires capturing both global
context and fine-grained temporal detail. This challenge is particularly
pronounced in long videos, where existing methods often compromise temporal
fidelity by over-downsampling or relying on fixed windows. We present
HieraMamba, a hierarchical architecture that preserves temporal structure and
semantic richness across scales. At its core are Anchor-MambaPooling (AMP)
blocks, which utilize Mamba's selective scanning to produce compact anchor
tokens that summarize video content at multiple granularities. Two
complementary objectives, anchor-conditioned and segment-pooled contrastive
losses, encourage anchors to retain local detail while remaining globally
discriminative. HieraMamba sets a new state-of-the-art on Ego4D-NLQ, MAD, and
TACoS, demonstrating precise, temporally faithful localization in long,
untrimmed videos.

Conclusion: 将图像转换为MIND特征空间是提高深度学习形变配准方法泛化能力的有效简单方法，集成策略能进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Deep learning based deformable registration methods have become popular in

TL;DR: EndoWave是一个用于内窥镜视频3D重建的统一时空高斯泼溅框架，通过结合基于光流的几何约束和多分辨率有理小波监督来解决内窥镜场景中的动态视觉伪影问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在机器人辅助微创手术中，从内窥镜视频进行准确的3D重建对下游任务和改善手术结果至关重要。但内窥镜场景存在光度不一致性、非刚性组织运动和视角依赖性高光等独特挑战，仅依赖外观约束的3DGS方法往往不足。

Method: 1. 采用统一的时空高斯表示，直接在4D域中优化基元；2. 提出基于光流的几何约束来增强时间一致性并有效约束场景的3D结构；3. 提出多分辨率有理正交小波作为约束，有效分离内窥镜细节并增强渲染性能。

Result: 在两个真实手术数据集EndoNeRF和StereoMIS上的广泛评估表明，EndoWave相比基线方法实现了最先进的重建质量和视觉精度。

Conclusion: EndoWave通过结合几何约束和小波监督，有效解决了内窥镜3D重建中的动态视觉伪影问题，显著提升了重建质量。

Abstract: In robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery, accurate 3D reconstruction from
endoscopic video is vital for downstream tasks and improved outcomes. However,
endoscopic scenarios present unique challenges, including photometric
inconsistencies, non-rigid tissue motion, and view-dependent highlights. Most
3DGS-based methods that rely solely on appearance constraints for optimizing
3DGS are often insufficient in this context, as these dynamic visual artifacts
can mislead the optimization process and lead to inaccurate reconstructions. To
address these limitations, we present EndoWave, a unified spatio-temporal
Gaussian Splatting framework by incorporating an optical flow-based geometric
constraint and a multi-resolution rational wavelet supervision. First, we adopt
a unified spatio-temporal Gaussian representation that directly optimizes
primitives in a 4D domain. Second, we propose a geometric constraint derived
from optical flow to enhance temporal coherence and effectively constrain the
3D structure of the scene. Third, we propose a multi-resolution rational
orthogonal wavelet as a constraint, which can effectively separate the details
of the endoscope and enhance the rendering performance. Extensive evaluations
on two real surgical datasets, EndoNeRF and StereoMIS, demonstrate that our
method EndoWave achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality and visual
accuracy compared to the baseline method.

Abstract: Multimodal position encoding is essential for vision-language models, yet
there has been little systematic investigation into multimodal position
encoding. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of multimodal Rotary Positional
Embedding (RoPE) by examining its two core components: position design and
frequency allocation. Through extensive experiments, we identify three key
guidelines: positional coherence, full frequency utilization, and preservation
of textual priors-ensuring unambiguous layout, rich representation, and
faithful transfer from the pre-trained LLM. Based on these insights, we propose
Multi-Head RoPE (MHRoPE) and MRoPE-Interleave (MRoPE-I), two simple and
plug-and-play variants that require no architectural changes. Our methods
consistently outperform existing approaches across diverse benchmarks, with
significant improvements in both general and fine-grained multimodal
understanding. Code will be avaliable at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了残差扩散桥模型（RDBM），通过理论推导广义扩散桥的随机微分方程，利用残差调制噪声注入和去除过程，实现自适应图像修复，在多个图像修复任务中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散桥模型缺乏统一分析视角，且通过全局噪声注入和去除会扭曲未退化区域，需要更精确的自适应修复方法。

Method: 理论推导广义扩散桥的随机微分方程，提出残差扩散桥模型，利用分布残差调制噪声过程，实现退化区域自适应修复。

Result: 在多种图像修复任务中取得最先进的定性和定量性能，证明了所提模型的最优性。

Conclusion: RDBM提供了一个统一的分析框架，现有桥模型都是其特例，能够有效实现自适应图像修复。

Abstract: Diffusion bridge models establish probabilistic paths between arbitrary
paired distributions and exhibit great potential for universal image
restoration. Most existing methods merely treat them as simple variants of
stochastic interpolants, lacking a unified analytical perspective. Besides,
they indiscriminately reconstruct images through global noise injection and
removal, inevitably distorting undegraded regions due to imperfect
reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose the Residual Diffusion
Bridge Model (RDBM). Specifically, we theoretically reformulate the stochastic
differential equations of generalized diffusion bridge and derive the
analytical formulas of its forward and reverse processes. Crucially, we
leverage the residuals from given distributions to modulate the noise injection
and removal, enabling adaptive restoration of degraded regions while preserving
intact others. Moreover, we unravel the fundamental mathematical essence of
existing bridge models, all of which are special cases of RDBM and empirically
demonstrate the optimality of our proposed models. Extensive experiments are
conducted to demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method both
qualitatively and quantitatively across diverse image restoration tasks. Code
is publicly available at https://github.com/MiliLab/RDBM.

TL;DR: 提出一个任务无关的多模态融合框架，用于时间序列和单时间戳图像的融合，支持跨模态生成和鲁棒的下游任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索时间序列和图像数据的多模态融合方法，实现跨模态生成和提升下游任务的性能。

Method: 采用确定性和学习策略进行时间序列量化，利用掩码相关性学习目标，在统一表示空间中对齐离散的图像和时间序列标记。

Result: 在Earth observation领域验证，预训练模型能从卫星图像生成一致的全球温度剖面，下游任务中R²平均提高6%，RMSE平均降低2%，优于基线方法50%的R²和12%的RMSE。

Conclusion: 该任务无关的预训练方法在多模态融合中表现出色，通过梯度敏感性分析提供了模型鲁棒性的见解。

Abstract: We propose a task-agnostic framework for multimodal fusion of time series and
single timestamp images, enabling cross-modal generation and robust downstream
performance. Our approach explores deterministic and learned strategies for
time series quantization and then leverages a masked correlation learning
objective, aligning discrete image and time series tokens in a unified
representation space. Instantiated in the Earth observation domain, the
pretrained model generates consistent global temperature profiles from
satellite imagery and is validated through counterfactual experiments. Across
downstream tasks, our task-agnostic pretraining outperforms task-specific
fusion by 6\% in R$^2$ and 2\% in RMSE on average, and exceeds baseline methods
by 50\% in R$^2$ and 12\% in RMSE. Finally, we analyze gradient sensitivity
across modalities, providing insights into model robustness. Code, data, and
weights will be released under a permissive license.

TL;DR: DeepSalt是一个基于深度学习的频谱迁移框架，通过知识蒸馏和新型频谱适配单元，将实验室光谱的高分辨率信息迁移到卫星高光谱传感中，实现无需大量地面采样的准确大尺度土壤盐分估算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 土壤盐渍化严重威胁生态系统和农业，限制植物吸水能力并降低作物产量。实验室光谱测量精确但难以扩展到区域或全球尺度，而卫星高光谱影像覆盖范围广但缺乏实验室仪器的精细可解释性。

Method: 提出DeepSalt框架，采用知识蒸馏策略和新型频谱适配单元，将实验室光谱的高分辨率知识迁移到卫星高光谱数据中，实现跨域光谱信息传递。

Result: DeepSalt在综合实证基准测试中显著优于未使用显式域适应的方法，证明了频谱适配单元和知识蒸馏策略的有效性。模型还能有效泛化到未见过的地理区域，解释了大部分盐分方差。

Conclusion: DeepSalt成功填补了实验室光谱和卫星遥感之间的差距，实现了无需大量地面采样的大尺度土壤盐分准确估算，为区域和全球尺度的土壤盐渍化监测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Soil salinization poses a significant threat to both ecosystems and
agriculture because it limits plants' ability to absorb water and, in doing so,
reduces crop productivity. This phenomenon alters the soil's spectral
properties, creating a measurable relationship between salinity and light
reflectance that enables remote monitoring. While laboratory spectroscopy
provides precise measurements, its reliance on in-situ sampling limits
scalability to regional or global levels. Conversely, hyperspectral satellite
imagery enables wide-area observation but lacks the fine-grained
interpretability of laboratory instruments. To bridge this gap, we introduce
DeepSalt, a deep-learning-based spectral transfer framework that leverages
knowledge distillation and a novel Spectral Adaptation Unit to transfer
high-resolution spectral insights from laboratory-based spectroscopy to
satellite-based hyperspectral sensing. Our approach eliminates the need for
extensive ground sampling while enabling accurate, large-scale salinity
estimation, as demonstrated through comprehensive empirical benchmarks.
DeepSalt achieves significant performance gains over methods without explicit
domain adaptation, underscoring the impact of the proposed Spectral Adaptation
Unit and the knowledge distillation strategy. The model also effectively
generalized to unseen geographic regions, explaining a substantial portion of
the salinity variance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文从总体最小二乘法角度统一了两种结构张量构造方法，证明Granlund和Knutsson 1995的修正项不必要，简化了张量解释并扩展了滤波器选择范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨Bigun和Granlund 1987与Granlund和Knutsson 1995提出的两种看似不同的结构张量构造方法之间的理论联系。

Method: 通过总体最小二乘法线拟合功率谱的统一视角，重新解释两种结构张量构造方法，并分析修正项的必要性。

Result: 证明Granlund和Knutsson 1995的修正项可以省略，确保张量保持半正定性，同时允许使用非正交滤波器和非角度镶嵌。

Conclusion: 两种结构张量方法在TLS框架下可以统一，修正项不必要，这简化了张量解释并扩展了滤波器选择灵活性。

Abstract: This note presents a theoretical discussion of two structure tensor
constructions: one proposed by Bigun and Granlund 1987, and the other by
Granlund and Knutsson 1995. At first glance, these approaches may appear quite
different--the former is implemented by averaging outer products of gradient
filter responses, while the latter constructs the tensor from weighted outer
products of tune-in frequency vectors of quadrature filters. We argue that when
both constructions are viewed through the common lens of Total Least Squares
(TLS) line fitting to the power spectrum, they can be reconciled to a large
extent, and additional benefits emerge. From this perspective, the correction
term introduced in Granlund and Knutsson 1995 becomes unnecessary. Omitting it
ensures that the resulting tensor remains positive semi-definite, thereby
simplifying the interpretation of its eigenvalues. Furthermore, this
interpretation allows fitting more than a single 0rientation to the input by
reinterpreting quadrature filter responses without relying on a structure
tensor. It also removes the constraint that responses must originate strictly
from quadrature filters, allowing the use of alternative filter types and
non-angular tessellations. These alternatives include Gabor filters--which,
although not strictly quadrature, are still suitable for structure tensor
construction--even when they tessellate the spectrum in a Cartesian fashion,
provided they are sufficiently concentrated.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法中，一些参考点往往远离目标物体，容易导致误检。需要确保参考点从物体表面或内部采样，并解决当前帧中部分被遮挡物体的问题。

Method: 使用深度信息和2D检测来生成深度引导查询，确保参考点从物体表面或内部采样；引入混合注意力机制，融合历史检测结果与深度引导查询形成混合查询。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，mAP提升6.3%，NDS提升4.3%，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的深度引导查询生成器和混合注意力机制有效解决了参考点采样不准确和部分遮挡问题，显著提升了3D目标检测性能。

Abstract: 3D object detection from multi-view images in traffic scenarios has garnered
significant attention in recent years. Many existing approaches rely on object
queries that are generated from 3D reference points to localize objects.
However, a limitation of these methods is that some reference points are often
far from the target object, which can lead to false positive detections. In
this paper, we propose a depth-guided query generator for 3D object detection
(DQ3D) that leverages depth information and 2D detections to ensure that
reference points are sampled from the surface or interior of the object.
Furthermore, to address partially occluded objects in current frame, we
introduce a hybrid attention mechanism that fuses historical detection results
with depth-guided queries, thereby forming hybrid queries. Evaluation on the
nuScenes dataset demonstrates that our method outperforms the baseline by 6.3\%
in terms of mean Average Precision (mAP) and 4.3\% in the NuScenes Detection
Score (NDS).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可迁移性评估方法难以准确评估具有多样化架构、训练策略和任务对齐的新兴预训练模型，需要更通用的解决方案。

Method: ITM框架隐式建模模型内在可迁移性，采用Divide-and-Conquer变分近似策略高效近似嵌入空间演化。

Result: 在涵盖广泛训练机制和模型类型的综合基准测试中，ITM在稳定性、有效性和效率方面持续优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ITM框架能够更准确地评估预训练模型的可迁移性，促进预训练-微调范式的发展和应用部署。

Abstract: Transferability estimation identifies the best pre-trained models for
downstream tasks without incurring the high computational cost of full
fine-tuning. This capability facilitates deployment and advances the
pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm. However, existing methods often struggle
to accurately assess transferability for emerging pre-trained models with
diverse architectures, training strategies, and task alignments. In this work,
we propose Implicit Transferability Modeling (ITM), a novel framework that
implicitly models each model's intrinsic transferability, coupled with a
Divide-and-Conquer Variational Approximation (DVA) strategy to efficiently
approximate embedding space evolution. This design enables generalization
across a broader range of models and downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on
a comprehensive benchmark--spanning extensive training regimes and a wider
variety of model types--demonstrate that ITM consistently outperforms existing
methods in terms of stability, effectiveness, and efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应门控融合方法AG-Fusion，通过选择性整合跨模态知识来提升复杂场景下的3D目标检测鲁棒性，在标准数据集和挑战性挖掘机场景数据集上均表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态相机-LiDAR融合方法在传感器退化或环境干扰等挑战性场景中性能显著下降，需要开发更鲁棒的融合策略。

Method: 首先将各模态特征投影到统一的BEV空间，使用基于窗口的注意力机制增强特征，然后设计基于跨模态注意力的自适应门控融合模块来整合特征。

Result: 在标准KITTI数据集上达到93.92%的准确率，在新建的E3D挖掘机数据集上比基线方法提升24.88%，在复杂工业场景中对不可靠模态信息表现出优越鲁棒性。

Conclusion: AG-Fusion方法能够有效处理传感器退化等挑战性场景，通过自适应门控融合机制显著提升了3D目标检测在复杂环境中的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Multimodal camera-LiDAR fusion technology has found extensive application in
3D object detection, demonstrating encouraging performance. However, existing
methods exhibit significant performance degradation in challenging scenarios
characterized by sensor degradation or environmental disturbances. We propose a
novel Adaptive Gated Fusion (AG-Fusion) approach that selectively integrates
cross-modal knowledge by identifying reliable patterns for robust detection in
complex scenes. Specifically, we first project features from each modality into
a unified BEV space and enhance them using a window-based attention mechanism.
Subsequently, an adaptive gated fusion module based on cross-modal attention is
designed to integrate these features into reliable BEV representations robust
to challenging environments. Furthermore, we construct a new dataset named
Excavator3D (E3D) focusing on challenging excavator operation scenarios to
benchmark performance in complex conditions. Our method not only achieves
competitive performance on the standard KITTI dataset with 93.92% accuracy, but
also significantly outperforms the baseline by 24.88% on the challenging E3D
dataset, demonstrating superior robustness to unreliable modal information in
complex industrial scenes.

Motivation: 现有3D场景类比方法需要额外训练和固定对象词汇表，限制了在未见环境中的适应性和规划能力。

Method: 使用基于视觉-语言模型特征的稀疏图和3D形状基础模型特征场的混合神经表示，通过先对齐图再细化特征场对应的粗到细方式寻找3D场景类比。

Result: 方法能够在复杂场景间建立准确的对应关系，并成功应用于轨迹和路径点转移。

Conclusion: 该方法为3D场景类比提供了零样本、开放词汇的解决方案，支持模仿学习和任务规划中的演示转移。

Abstract: Connecting current observations with prior experiences helps robots adapt and
plan in new, unseen 3D environments. Recently, 3D scene analogies have been
proposed to connect two 3D scenes, which are smooth maps that align scene
regions with common spatial relationships. These maps enable detailed transfer
of trajectories or waypoints, potentially supporting demonstration transfer for
imitation learning or task plan transfer across scenes. However, existing
methods for the task require additional training and fixed object vocabularies.
In this work, we propose to use multimodal foundation models for finding 3D
scene analogies in a zero-shot, open-vocabulary setting. Central to our
approach is a hybrid neural representation of scenes that consists of a sparse
graph based on vision-language model features and a feature field derived from
3D shape foundation models. 3D scene analogies are then found in a
coarse-to-fine manner, by first aligning the graph and refining the
correspondence with feature fields. Our method can establish accurate
correspondences between complex scenes, and we showcase applications in
trajectory and waypoint transfer.

TL;DR: 本文研究了视觉语言模型在零样本异常行为识别中的空间推理能力，通过将视频转换为文本描述并使用文本蕴含来评分标签，评估了四种开源模型在UCF-Crime和RWF-2000数据集上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社会广泛使用摄像头产生了海量视频数据，远超人类监控能力，这对公共安全和安防构成了关键挑战，需要及时检测异常或犯罪事件。

Method: 将异常行为识别构建为零样本、基于语言的任务，通过将视频转换为文本描述，使用文本蕴含来评分标签，评估了四种预训练视觉-LLM模型在提示和隐私保护条件下的表现。

Result: 少量样本示例可以提高某些模型的准确性，但可能增加误报；隐私过滤器（尤其是全身GAN变换）会引入不一致性并降低准确性。当前视觉-LLM在简单、空间显著事件上表现良好，但在噪声空间线索和身份混淆方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: 提出了无需任务特定训练即可增强空间基础的具体路径：结构感知提示、跨片段的轻量级空间记忆、描述过程中的场景图或3D姿态先验，以及保留动作相关几何的隐私方法。这为零样本、基于语言的管道作为适应性构建块用于具身现实世界视频理解奠定了基础。

Abstract: The widespread use of cameras in our society has created an overwhelming
amount of video data, far exceeding the capacity for human monitoring. This
presents a critical challenge for public safety and security, as the timely
detection of anomalous or criminal events is crucial for effective response and
prevention. The ability for an embodied agent to recognize unexpected events is
fundamentally tied to its capacity for spatial reasoning. This paper
investigates the spatial reasoning of vision-language models (VLMs) by framing
anomalous action recognition as a zero-shot, language-grounded task, addressing
the embodied perception challenge of interpreting dynamic 3D scenes from sparse
2D video. Specifically, we investigate whether small, pre-trained vision--LLMs
can act as spatially-grounded, zero-shot anomaly detectors by converting video
into text descriptions and scoring labels via textual entailment. We evaluate
four open models on UCF-Crime and RWF-2000 under prompting and
privacy-preserving conditions. Few-shot exemplars can improve accuracy for some
models, but may increase false positives, and privacy filters -- especially
full-body GAN transforms -- introduce inconsistencies that degrade accuracy.
These results chart where current vision--LLMs succeed (simple, spatially
salient events) and where they falter (noisy spatial cues, identity
obfuscation). Looking forward, we outline concrete paths to strengthen spatial
grounding without task-specific training: structure-aware prompts, lightweight
spatial memory across clips, scene-graph or 3D-pose priors during description,
and privacy methods that preserve action-relevant geometry. This positions
zero-shot, language-grounded pipelines as adaptable building blocks for
embodied, real-world video understanding. Our implementation for evaluating
VLMs is publicly available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DecoDINO是一个基于DECO框架的三分支网络，用于改进人体与物体接触预测，在DAMON基准测试中显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DECO模型在野外环境中只能预测二元接触图，且在软表面、遮挡、儿童和足部误报接触方面存在局限，需要更精确的顶点级接触预测。

Method: 使用两个DINOv2 ViT-g/14编码器，采用类别平衡损失加权减少偏差，通过补丁级交叉注意力改进局部推理，最终通过轻量级MLP和softmax分配语义接触标签。

Result: 在DAMON基准测试中：二元接触F1分数提升7%，测地误差减半，增加了对象级语义标签预测，在DAMON挑战赛的两个任务中都优于基准线。

Conclusion: DecoDINO通过LoRA微调和双编码器架构显著改进了人体-物体接触预测，在多个指标上超越了现有方法。

Abstract: Accurate vertex-level contact prediction between humans and surrounding
objects is a prerequisite for high fidelity human object interaction models
used in robotics, AR/VR, and behavioral simulation. DECO was the first in the
wild estimator for this task but is limited to binary contact maps and
struggles with soft surfaces, occlusions, children, and false-positive foot
contacts. We address these issues and introduce DecoDINO, a three-branch
network based on DECO's framework. It uses two DINOv2 ViT-g/14 encoders,
class-balanced loss weighting to reduce bias, and patch-level cross-attention
for improved local reasoning. Vertex features are finally passed through a
lightweight MLP with a softmax to assign semantic contact labels. We also
tested a vision-language model (VLM) to integrate text features, but the
simpler architecture performed better and was used instead. On the DAMON
benchmark, DecoDINO (i) raises the binary-contact F1 score by 7$\%$, (ii)
halves the geodesic error, and (iii) augments predictions with object-level
semantic labels. Ablation studies show that LoRA fine-tuning and the dual
encoders are key to these improvements. DecoDINO outperformed the challenge
baseline in both tasks of the DAMON Challenge. Our code is available at

Conclusion: VR-Drive是端到端自动驾驶系统在现实世界部署中可扩展且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) has emerged as a promising paradigm
that unifies perception, prediction, and planning into a holistic, data-driven
framework. However, achieving robustness to varying camera viewpoints, a common
real-world challenge due to diverse vehicle configurations, remains an open
problem. In this work, we propose VR-Drive, a novel E2E-AD framework that
addresses viewpoint generalization by jointly learning 3D scene reconstruction
as an auxiliary task to enable planning-aware view synthesis. Unlike prior
scene-specific synthesis approaches, VR-Drive adopts a feed-forward inference
strategy that supports online training-time augmentation from sparse views
without additional annotations. To further improve viewpoint consistency, we
introduce a viewpoint-mixed memory bank that facilitates temporal interaction
across multiple viewpoints and a viewpoint-consistent distillation strategy
that transfers knowledge from original to synthesized views. Trained in a fully
end-to-end manner, VR-Drive effectively mitigates synthesis-induced noise and
improves planning under viewpoint shifts. In addition, we release a new
benchmark dataset to evaluate E2E-AD performance under novel camera viewpoints,
enabling comprehensive analysis. Our results demonstrate that VR-Drive is a
scalable and robust solution for the real-world deployment of end-to-end
autonomous driving systems.

Conclusion: PathSearch是一个可扩展且通用的数字病理学检索解决方案，能够有效支持临床诊断和教育。

Abstract: The rapid digitization of histopathology slides has opened up new
possibilities for computational tools in clinical and research workflows. Among
these, content-based slide retrieval stands out, enabling pathologists to
identify morphologically and semantically similar cases, thereby supporting
precise diagnoses, enhancing consistency across observers, and assisting
example-based education. However, effective retrieval of whole slide images
(WSIs) remains challenging due to their gigapixel scale and the difficulty of
capturing subtle semantic differences amid abundant irrelevant content. To
overcome these challenges, we present PathSearch, a retrieval framework that
unifies fine-grained attentive mosaic representations with global-wise slide
embeddings aligned through vision-language contrastive learning. Trained on a
corpus of 6,926 slide-report pairs, PathSearch captures both fine-grained
morphological cues and high-level semantic patterns to enable accurate and
flexible retrieval. The framework supports two key functionalities: (1)
mosaic-based image-to-image retrieval, ensuring accurate and efficient slide
research; and (2) multi-modal retrieval, where text queries can directly
retrieve relevant slides. PathSearch was rigorously evaluated on four public
pathology datasets and three in-house cohorts, covering tasks including
anatomical site retrieval, tumor subtyping, tumor vs. non-tumor discrimination,
and grading across diverse organs such as breast, lung, kidney, liver, and
stomach. External results show that PathSearch outperforms traditional
image-to-image retrieval frameworks. A multi-center reader study further
demonstrates that PathSearch improves diagnostic accuracy, boosts confidence,
and enhances inter-observer agreement among pathologists in real clinical
scenarios. These results establish PathSearch as a scalable and generalizable

### [174] [Through the Lens: Benchmarking Deepfake Detectors Against Moiré-Induced Distortions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23225)
*Razaib Tariq,Minji Heo,Simon S. Woo,Shahroz Tariq*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究系统评估了深度伪造检测器在莫尔条纹影响下的性能，发现莫尔伪影会使检测准确率下降高达25.4%，而去莫尔方法反而会恶化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在现实场景中，智能手机从数字屏幕拍摄媒体时引入的莫尔伪影对深度伪造检测结果造成的扭曲问题，这一议题此前关注较少。

Method: 收集了12,832个视频数据集，涵盖多个公开数据集，并在不同现实条件下拍摄；使用DeepMoiréFake数据集和两种合成莫尔生成技术进行额外实验；评估了15个顶级检测器的性能。

Result: 莫尔伪影使检测性能下降高达25.4%，合成莫尔模式导致准确率下降21.4%；去莫尔方法反而使问题恶化，准确率下降高达17.2%。

Conclusion: 迫切需要能够稳健处理莫尔扭曲及其他现实挑战的检测模型，DMF数据集的引入旨在推动研究填补受控实验与实际深度伪造检测之间的差距。

Abstract: Deepfake detection remains a pressing challenge, particularly in real-world
settings where smartphone-captured media from digital screens often introduces
Moir\'e artifacts that can distort detection outcomes. This study
systematically evaluates state-of-the-art (SOTA) deepfake detectors on
Moir\'e-affected videos, an issue that has received little attention. We
collected a dataset of 12,832 videos, spanning 35.64 hours, from the Celeb-DF,
DFD, DFDC, UADFV, and FF++ datasets, capturing footage under diverse real-world
conditions, including varying screens, smartphones, lighting setups, and camera
angles. To further examine the influence of Moir\'e patterns on deepfake
detection, we conducted additional experiments using our DeepMoir\'eFake,
referred to as (DMF) dataset and two synthetic Moir\'e generation techniques.
Across 15 top-performing detectors, our results show that Moir\'e artifacts
degrade performance by as much as 25.4%, while synthetically generated Moir\'e
patterns lead to a 21.4% drop in accuracy. Surprisingly, demoir\'eing methods,
intended as a mitigation approach, instead worsened the problem, reducing
accuracy by up to 17.2%. These findings underscore the urgent need for
detection models that can robustly handle Moir\'e distortions alongside other
realworld challenges, such as compression, sharpening, and blurring. By
introducing the DMF dataset, we aim to drive future research toward closing the
gap between controlled experiments and practical deepfake detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Eruku方法，将风格化手写文本生成重新定义为多模态提示条件生成任务，通过引入特殊文本标记和改进的自回归模型，解决了内容可控性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归Transformer方法在风格化手写文本生成中需要额外输入、缺乏停止机制、容易产生重复循环和视觉伪影，需要改进内容可控性。

Method: 将HTG作为多模态提示条件生成任务，引入特殊文本输入标记以更好地与视觉标记对齐，并设计了基于Classifier-Free-Guidance的自回归模型策略。

Result: 相比之前方案，Eruku需要更少的输入，对未见风格泛化能力更强，能更忠实地遵循文本提示，提高了内容一致性。

Conclusion: Eruku方法通过重新制定自回归框架，有效解决了风格化手写文本生成中的内容可控性问题，在多个方面优于现有解决方案。

Abstract: Generating faithful and readable styled text images (especially for Styled
Handwritten Text generation - HTG) is an open problem with several possible
applications across graphic design, document understanding, and image editing.
A lot of research effort in this task is dedicated to developing strategies
that reproduce the stylistic characteristics of a given writer, with promising
results in terms of style fidelity and generalization achieved by the recently
proposed Autoregressive Transformer paradigm for HTG. However, this method
requires additional inputs, lacks a proper stop mechanism, and might end up in
repetition loops, generating visual artifacts. In this work, we rethink the
autoregressive formulation by framing HTG as a multimodal prompt-conditioned
generation task, and tackle the content controllability issues by introducing
special textual input tokens for better alignment with the visual ones.
Moreover, we devise a Classifier-Free-Guidance-based strategy for our
autoregressive model. Through extensive experimental validation, we demonstrate
that our approach, dubbed Eruku, compared to previous solutions requires fewer
inputs, generalizes better to unseen styles, and follows more faithfully the
textual prompt, improving content adherence.

TL;DR: 提出了一种渐进式增大图像块尺寸的自动课程学习方法，用于3D医学图像分割，能改善类别平衡并加速训练收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统固定图像块尺寸方法在3D医学图像分割中存在的类别不平衡问题和训练效率低下的问题。

Method: 在模型训练过程中逐步增大图像块尺寸，设计了资源高效模式和性能模式两种设置。

Result: 资源高效模式将训练时间减少到44%的同时保持分割性能；性能模式在15个任务中均超越基线，平均Dice分数提升1.28%，训练时间减少到89%。

Conclusion: 这种简单优雅的数据变换方法能显著提升分割性能和训练效率，且适用于多种分割架构。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Progressive Growing of Patch Size, an automatic
curriculum learning approach for 3D medical image segmentation. Our approach
progressively increases the patch size during model training, resulting in an
improved class balance for smaller patch sizes and accelerated convergence of
the training process. We evaluate our curriculum approach in two settings: a
resource-efficient mode and a performance mode, both regarding Dice score
performance and computational costs across 15 diverse and popular 3D medical
image segmentation tasks. The resource-efficient mode matches the Dice score
performance of the conventional constant patch size sampling baseline with a
notable reduction in training time to only 44%. The performance mode improves
upon constant patch size segmentation results, achieving a statistically
significant relative mean performance gain of 1.28% in Dice Score. Remarkably,
across all 15 tasks, our proposed performance mode manages to surpass the
constant patch size baseline in Dice Score performance, while simultaneously
reducing training time to only 89%. The benefits are particularly pronounced
for highly imbalanced tasks such as lesion segmentation tasks. Rigorous
experiments demonstrate that our performance mode not only improves mean
segmentation performance but also reduces performance variance, yielding more
trustworthy model comparison. Furthermore, our findings reveal that the
proposed curriculum sampling is not tied to a specific architecture but
represents a broadly applicable strategy that consistently boosts performance
across diverse segmentation models, including UNet, UNETR, and SwinUNETR. In
summary, we show that this simple yet elegant transformation on input data
substantially improves both Dice Score performance and training runtime, while
being compatible across diverse segmentation backbones.

*Sam Pollard,Michael Wray*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于Shapley值的特征归因和模态评分方法，评估6个不同上下文长度的VLM模型在4个VQA数据集上的表现，发现模型对文本过度依赖，多选VQA任务退化为模型忽略干扰项的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着对视觉语言模型的依赖增加，需要评估多模态模型是否朝着正确方向发展，特别是解决文本主导问题和探索模态间交互。

Method: 使用Shapley值计算特征归因和模态评分，将视频帧和文本元素视为平等特征，将多选VQA任务视为视频、问题和答案三个模态的交互。

Result: 结果显示模型对文本存在依赖性，多选VQA任务实际上变成了模型忽略干扰项的能力测试。

Conclusion: 当前VLM模型在多选VQA任务中过度依赖文本模态，需要更好的方法来评估和改善多模态交互。

Abstract: As we become increasingly dependent on vision language models (VLMs) to
answer questions about the world around us, there is a significant amount of
research devoted to increasing both the difficulty of video question answering
(VQA) datasets, and the context lengths of the models that they evaluate. The
reliance on large language models as backbones has lead to concerns about
potential text dominance, and the exploration of interactions between
modalities is underdeveloped. How do we measure whether we're heading in the
right direction, with the complexity that multi-modal models introduce? We
propose a joint method of computing both feature attributions and modality
scores based on Shapley values, where both the features and modalities are
arbitrarily definable. Using these metrics, we compare $6$ VLM models of
varying context lengths on $4$ representative datasets, focusing on
multiple-choice VQA. In particular, we consider video frames and whole textual
elements as equal features in the hierarchy, and the multiple-choice VQA task
as an interaction between three modalities: video, question and answer. Our
results demonstrate a dependence on text and show that the multiple-choice VQA
task devolves into a model's ability to ignore distractors. Code available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于YOLO模型的端到端层次化图像检测分类方法，通过新颖的层次架构、改进的损失函数和专用性能指标，解决传统平面分类忽略现实物体层次结构的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界物体具有自然层次结构，传统CNN平面分类方法仅识别图像中指定对象，忽略了对象间的关系，而层次关系能提供更好的上下文理解并控制错误严重程度。

Method: 基于YOLO模型家族构建端到端层次化模型，引入新颖的层次架构、改进的损失函数和针对层次特性的性能评估指标，在两种不同层次分类的数据集上进行训练和评估。

Result: 结果显示该方法能有效处理现实世界物体固有的层次结构，这是传统平面分类算法经常忽略的。

Conclusion: 提出的层次化方法能够更好地捕捉对象间的关系，为图像分类提供更丰富的上下文理解，并控制分类错误的严重程度。

Abstract: Current convolution neural network (CNN) classification methods are
predominantly focused on flat classification which aims solely to identify a
specified object within an image. However, real-world objects often possess a
natural hierarchical organization that can significantly help classification
tasks. Capturing the presence of relations between objects enables better
contextual understanding as well as control over the severity of mistakes.
Considering these aspects, this paper proposes an end-to-end hierarchical model
for image detection and classification built upon the YOLO model family. A
novel hierarchical architecture, a modified loss function, and a performance
metric tailored to the hierarchical nature of the model are introduced. The
proposed model is trained and evaluated on two different hierarchical
categorizations of the same dataset: a systematic categorization that
disregards visual similarities between objects and a categorization accounting
for common visual characteristics across classes. The results illustrate how
the suggested methodology addresses the inherent hierarchical structure present
in real-world objects, which conventional flat classification algorithms often
overlook.

TL;DR: 提出了AdaSDE，一种新颖的单步SDE求解器，通过动态调节误差校正强度来加速扩散采样，在5步内实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于ODE和SDE的求解器存在互补弱点：ODE求解器沿确定性轨迹积累不可约梯度误差，而SDE方法在步数有限时遭受放大的离散化误差。

Method: 引入AdaSDE，一种单步SDE求解器，通过轻量级蒸馏估计每个步骤的可学习系数，动态调节误差校正强度。该框架可与现有求解器集成。

Result: 在5步采样下，AdaSDE在CIFAR-10上达到FID 4.18，FFHQ上8.05，LSUN Bedroom上6.96，表现最先进。

Conclusion: AdaSDE成功统一了ODE的效率和SDE的误差弹性，为扩散采样提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative processes, formulated as differential equation
solving, frequently balance computational speed with sample quality. Our
theoretical investigation of ODE- and SDE-based solvers reveals complementary
weaknesses: ODE solvers accumulate irreducible gradient error along
deterministic trajectories, while SDE methods suffer from amplified
discretization errors when the step budget is limited. Building upon this
insight, we introduce AdaSDE, a novel single-step SDE solver that aims to unify
the efficiency of ODEs with the error resilience of SDEs. Specifically, we
introduce a single per-step learnable coefficient, estimated via lightweight
distillation, which dynamically regulates the error correction strength to
accelerate diffusion sampling. Notably, our framework can be integrated with
existing solvers to enhance their capabilities. Extensive experiments
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance: at 5 NFE, AdaSDE achieves FID scores
of 4.18 on CIFAR-10, 8.05 on FFHQ and 6.96 on LSUN Bedroom. Codes are available

TL;DR: 提出了MMSD3.0多图像讽刺检测基准和CIRM跨图像推理模型，通过跨图像序列建模和细粒度跨模态融合机制，在多图像和单图像讽刺检测任务上都达到了最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有讽刺检测研究主要关注单图像场景，忽略了多图像之间的语义和情感关系，无法有效建模现实世界中由多图像线索触发的讽刺情况。

Method: 提出CIRM模型，包括跨图像序列建模来捕捉图像间潜在联系，以及基于文本-图像对应关系的细粒度跨模态融合机制来减少信息损失。

Result: MMSD3.0被证明是有效可靠的基准，能更好反映现实条件；CIRM在MMSD、MMSD2.0和MMSD3.0数据集上都达到了最先进性能。

Conclusion: 多图像讽刺检测是重要研究方向，CIRM模型通过跨图像推理和细粒度融合机制，在单图像和多图像场景中都表现出色。

Abstract: Despite progress in multimodal sarcasm detection, existing datasets and
methods predominantly focus on single-image scenarios, overlooking potential
semantic and affective relations across multiple images. This leaves a gap in
modeling cases where sarcasm is triggered by multi-image cues in real-world
settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMSD3.0, a new benchmark composed
entirely of multi-image samples curated from tweets and Amazon reviews. We
further propose the Cross-Image Reasoning Model (CIRM), which performs targeted
cross-image sequence modeling to capture latent inter-image connections. In
addition, we introduce a relevance-guided, fine-grained cross-modal fusion
mechanism based on text-image correspondence to reduce information loss during
integration. We establish a comprehensive suite of strong and representative
baselines and conduct extensive experiments, showing that MMSD3.0 is an
effective and reliable benchmark that better reflects real-world conditions.
Moreover, CIRM demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across MMSD, MMSD2.0
and MMSD3.0, validating its effectiveness in both single-image and multi-image
scenarios.

*Yingying Feng,Jie Li,Jie Hu,Yukang Zhang,Lei Tan,Jiayi Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MDReID框架，通过模态解耦学习和模态感知度量学习解决多模态重识别中的模态不一致问题，在匹配和不匹配场景下均取得显著性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的重识别系统面临模态不一致挑战（如RGB、NIR、TIR等不同传感器），现有方法大多假设模态匹配条件，限制了实际应用中的鲁棒性和可扩展性

Method: MDReID包含两个关键组件：模态解耦学习（MDL）将模态特征分解为可预测的模态共享特征和捕获独特特性的模态特定特征；模态感知度量学习（MML）强制两个组件之间的正交性和互补性以增强跨模态判别能力

Result: 在三个多模态重识别基准测试（RGBNT201、RGBNT100、MSVR310）上，MDReID在模态匹配场景下分别获得9.8%、3.0%、11.5%的mAP提升，在模态不匹配场景下平均提升3.4%、11.8%、10.9%

Conclusion: MDReID是一个灵活的任意到任意图像级重识别框架，能够有效处理模态匹配和不匹配场景，通过模态特征分解和专门设计的度量学习策略显著提升了跨模态重识别性能

Abstract: Real-world object re-identification (ReID) systems often face modality
inconsistencies, where query and gallery images come from different sensors
(e.g., RGB, NIR, TIR). However, most existing methods assume modality-matched
conditions, which limits their robustness and scalability in practical
applications. To address this challenge, we propose MDReID, a flexible
any-to-any image-level ReID framework designed to operate under both
modality-matched and modality-mismatched scenarios. MDReID builds on the
insight that modality information can be decomposed into two components:
modality-shared features that are predictable and transferable, and
modality-specific features that capture unique, modality-dependent
characteristics. To effectively leverage this, MDReID introduces two key
components: the Modality Decoupling Learning (MDL) and Modality-aware Metric
Learning (MML). Specifically, MDL explicitly decomposes modality features into
modality-shared and modality-specific representations, enabling effective
retrieval in both modality-aligned and mismatched scenarios. MML, a tailored
metric learning strategy, further enforces orthogonality and complementarity
between the two components to enhance discriminative power across modalities.
Extensive experiments conducted on three challenging multi-modality ReID
benchmarks (RGBNT201, RGBNT100, MSVR310) consistently demonstrate the
superiority of MDReID. Notably, MDReID achieves significant mAP improvements of
9.8\%, 3.0\%, and 11.5\% in general modality-matched scenarios, and average
gains of 3.4\%, 11.8\%, and 10.9\% in modality-mismatched scenarios,
respectively. The code is available at:

Motivation: 现有多视图3D重建方法严重依赖输入视图之间的充分重叠，但在实践中遮挡和稀疏覆盖经常导致严重的不完整重建。扩散式3D生成技术有潜力通过学习生成先验来补全对象的不可见部分，但其随机性限制了生成结果的准确性和可靠性。

Method: 提出ReconViaGen方法，创新性地将重建先验整合到生成框架中，设计了多种策略来有效解决扩散式3D生成方法的一致性问题，包括改进多视图图像特征的构建和利用方式，以及提高迭代去噪在局部细节生成中的可控性。

Result: 大量实验证明，ReconViaGen能够重建与输入视图在全局结构和局部细节上都一致的完整且准确的3D模型。

Conclusion: ReconViaGen成功解决了扩散式3D生成方法的一致性问题，实现了高质量的多视图3D重建，在完整性和准确性方面均表现出色。

Abstract: Existing multi-view 3D object reconstruction methods heavily rely on
sufficient overlap between input views, where occlusions and sparse coverage in
practice frequently yield severe reconstruction incompleteness. Recent
advancements in diffusion-based 3D generative techniques offer the potential to
address these limitations by leveraging learned generative priors to
hallucinate invisible parts of objects, thereby generating plausible 3D
structures. However, the stochastic nature of the inference process limits the
accuracy and reliability of generation results, preventing existing
reconstruction frameworks from integrating such 3D generative priors. In this
work, we comprehensively analyze the reasons why diffusion-based 3D generative
methods fail to achieve high consistency, including (a) the insufficiency in
constructing and leveraging cross-view connections when extracting multi-view
image features as conditions, and (b) the poor controllability of iterative
denoising during local detail generation, which easily leads to plausible but
inconsistent fine geometric and texture details with inputs. Accordingly, we
propose ReconViaGen to innovatively integrate reconstruction priors into the
generative framework and devise several strategies that effectively address
these issues. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ReconViaGen can
reconstruct complete and accurate 3D models consistent with input views in both
global structure and local details.Project page:

Abstract: This thesis works to address a pivotal challenge in medical image analysis:
the reliance on extensive labeled datasets, which are often limited due to the
need for expert annotation and constrained by privacy and legal issues. By
focusing on the development of self-supervised learning techniques and domain
adaptation methods, this research aims to circumvent these limitations,
presenting a novel approach to enhance the utility and efficacy of deep
learning in medical imaging.
  Central to this thesis is the development of the Medformer, an innovative
neural network architecture designed for multitask learning and deep domain
adaptation. This model is adept at pre-training on diverse medical image
datasets, handling varying sizes and modalities, and is equipped with a dynamic
input-output adaptation mechanism. This enables efficient processing and
integration of a wide range of medical image types, from 2D X-rays to complex
3D MRIs, thus mitigating the dependency on large labeled datasets.
  Further, the thesis explores the current state of self-supervised learning in
medical imaging. It introduces novel pretext tasks that are capable of
extracting meaningful information from unlabeled data, significantly advancing
the model's interpretative abilities. This approach is validated through
rigorous experimentation, including the use of the MedMNIST dataset,
demonstrating the model's proficiency in learning generalized features
applicable to various downstream tasks.
  In summary, this thesis contributes to the advancement of medical image
analysis by offering a scalable, adaptable framework that reduces reliance on
labeled data. It paves the way for more accurate, efficient diagnostic tools in
healthcare, signifying a major step forward in the application of deep learning
in medical imaging.

improving over the published baseline by around 20 percentage points, with
trends confirmed by cross-validation. To understand why tiling is effective, we
further apply Grad-CAM and Score-CAM and attention analyses, which enhance

TL;DR: 提出了PlanarTrack，一个用于平面跟踪的大规模高质量基准数据集，包含1150个序列、73.3万帧，支持短期和长期跟踪评估，是目前最大、最多样化、最具挑战性的平面跟踪数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 平面跟踪在机器人和增强现实中具有重要作用，但在深度学习时代的发展受到缺乏大规模平台的限制。

Method: 构建包含1150个序列的大规模数据集，所有视频在无约束条件下录制，每个视频帧通过四角点手动标注，并经过多轮细致检查和精炼，每个序列只捕获一个独特目标以增强目标多样性。

Result: 评估了10个代表性平面跟踪器，结果显示顶级跟踪器在PlanarTrack上性能显著下降，表明需要更多努力来改进平面跟踪。

Conclusion: PlanarTrack是目前最大、最多样化和最具挑战性的平面跟踪数据集，为未来研究提供了比较基准，揭示了当前方法在真实场景中的局限性。

Abstract: Planar tracking has drawn increasing interest owing to its key roles in
robotics and augmented reality. Despite recent great advancement, further
development of planar tracking, particularly in the deep learning era, is
largely limited compared to generic tracking due to the lack of large-scale
platforms. To mitigate this, we propose PlanarTrack, a large-scale high-quality
and challenging benchmark for planar tracking. Specifically, PlanarTrack
consists of 1,150 sequences with over 733K frames, including 1,000 short-term
and 150 new long-term videos, which enables comprehensive evaluation of short-
and long-term tracking performance. All videos in PlanarTrack are recorded in
unconstrained conditions from the wild, which makes PlanarTrack challenging but
more realistic for real-world applications. To ensure high-quality annotations,
each video frame is manually annotated by four corner points with multi-round
meticulous inspection and refinement. To enhance target diversity of
PlanarTrack, we only capture a unique target in one sequence, which is
different from existing benchmarks. To our best knowledge, PlanarTrack is by
far the largest and most diverse and challenging dataset dedicated to planar
tracking. To understand performance of existing methods on PlanarTrack and to
provide a comparison for future research, we evaluate 10 representative planar
trackers with extensive comparison and in-depth analysis. Our evaluation
reveals that, unsurprisingly, the top planar trackers heavily degrade on the
challenging PlanarTrack, which indicates more efforts are required for
improving planar tracking. Our data and results will be released at

Abstract: Super resolution offers a way to harness medium even lowresolution but
historically valuable remote sensing image archives. Generative models,
especially diffusion models, have recently been applied to remote sensing super
resolution (RSSR), yet several challenges exist. First, diffusion models are
effective but require expensive training from scratch resources and have slow
inference speeds. Second, current methods have limited utilization of auxiliary
information as real-world constraints to reconstruct scientifically realistic
images. Finally, most current methods lack evaluation on downstream tasks. In
this study, we present a efficient LSSR framework for RSSR, supported by a new
multimodal dataset of paired 30 m Landsat 8 and 10 m Sentinel 2 imagery. Built
on frozen pretrained Stable Diffusion, LSSR integrates crossmodal attention
with auxiliary knowledge (Digital Elevation Model, land cover, month) and
Synthetic Aperture Radar guidance, enhanced by adapters and a tailored Fourier
NDVI loss to balance spatial details and spectral fidelity. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that LSSR significantly improves crop boundary
delineation and recovery, achieving state-of-the-art performance with Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio/Structural Similarity Index Measure of 32.63/0.84 (RGB)
and 23.99/0.78 (IR), and the lowest NDVI Mean Squared Error (0.042), while
maintaining efficient inference (0.39 sec/image). Moreover, LSSR transfers
effectively to NASA Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel (HLS) super resolution,
yielding more reliable crop classification (F1: 0.86) than Sentinel-2 (F1:
0.85). These results highlight the potential of RSSR to advance precision
agriculture.

TL;DR: 提出VideoTG-R1框架，通过边界反射代理识别部分标注样本，通过难度估计代理设计课程强化学习策略，在仅使用10%训练数据和21%计算预算的情况下，超越全数据方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视频时序定位中部分标注样本带来的模糊监督问题，以及难定位样本在强化学习训练中产生低且不可区分奖励的问题。

Method: 提出边界反射代理识别查询相关时间戳以过滤部分标注样本，引入难度估计代理评估样本训练难度，设计课程强化学习策略动态屏蔽难定位样本的视频内容。

Result: 在VTG和基于视频的问答任务上表现优异，仅用10%训练数据和21%计算预算就超越了全数据方法。

Conclusion: VideoTG-R1通过解决部分标注和难定位样本问题，实现了数据高效的训练，显著提升了视频时序定位的性能。

Abstract: Video temporal grounding (VTG) aims to locate precise segments in videos
based on language queries, which is a fundamental challenge in video
understanding. While recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown
promise in tackling VTG through reinforcement learning (RL), they overlook the
challenges arising from both the quality and difficulty of training samples.
(1) Partially annotated samples. Many samples contain relevant segments beyond
the annotated interval, introducing ambiguous supervision. (2) Hard-to-ground
samples. Samples with poor zero-shot performance produce consistently low and
indistinguishable rewards during RL training, exhibiting no clear preference
among multiple outputs and thus hindering learning efficiency. To address these
challenges, we propose VideoTG-R1, a novel curriculum RL framework with
reflected boundary annotations, enabling data-efficient training. Specifically,
we propose a Boundary Reflection Agent that utilizes MLLMs to predict
query-relevant timestamps outside the annotated intervals, allowing us to
identify and filter out partially annotated samples, thereby reducing
ambiguity. Furthermore, we introduce a Difficulty Estimation Agent to assess
the training difficulty of each sample and design a curriculum RL strategy that
dynamically masks the videos of hard-to-ground samples according to the
training steps, easing the training difficulty and providing clearer
preference. Experiments on the VTG and grounded VideoQA tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method. Remarkably, with only 10% of the training samples
and 21% of the computational budget, VideoTG-R1 outperforms full-data
counterparts under both group relative policy optimization (GRPO) and
supervised fine-tuning (SFT). The code is available at
https://github.com/ldong1111/VideoTG-R1.

Abstract: The project has carried out the re-optimization of image coloring in
accordance with the existing Autocolorization direction model DDColor. For the
experiments on the existing weights of DDColor, we found that it has
limitations in some frequency bands and the color cast problem caused by
insufficient input dimension. We construct two optimization schemes and combine

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 点云学习技术因缺乏大规模数据集而受限，需要一种可任意扩展的数据生成方法来克服数据稀缺问题。

Method: 利用对称性概念创建具有已知结构和高变异性的形状，通过公式驱动的方式生成任意规模的点云数据集。

Conclusion: Symmetria数据集通过公式驱动生成解决了点云数据稀缺问题，支持高效实验和广泛泛化，促进了点云学习研究的进一步发展。

Abstract: Unlike image or text domains that benefit from an abundance of large-scale
datasets, point cloud learning techniques frequently encounter limitations due
to the scarcity of extensive datasets. To overcome this limitation, we present
Symmetria, a formula-driven dataset that can be generated at any arbitrary
scale. By construction, it ensures the absolute availability of precise ground
truth, promotes data-efficient experimentation by requiring fewer samples,
enables broad generalization across diverse geometric settings, and offers easy
extensibility to new tasks and modalities. Using the concept of symmetry, we
create shapes with known structure and high variability, enabling neural
networks to learn point cloud features effectively. Our results demonstrate
that this dataset is highly effective for point cloud self-supervised
pre-training, yielding models with strong performance in downstream tasks such
as classification and segmentation, which also show good few-shot learning
capabilities. Additionally, our dataset can support fine-tuning models to
classify real-world objects, highlighting our approach's practical utility and
application. We also introduce a challenging task for symmetry detection and
provide a benchmark for baseline comparisons. A significant advantage of our
approach is the public availability of the dataset, the accompanying code, and
the ability to generate very large collections, promoting further research and
innovation in point cloud learning.

Motivation: 传统医学影像分析通常依赖2D切片和大量专家标注，难以适应3D脑部解剖结构的完整建模和多模态输入的需求。

Method: 扩展DINO-v2视觉变换器，从连续MRI切片中提取3D体积信息，支持单模态和多模态输入，实现全脑解剖建模。

Result: BrainFound在多种下游任务中持续优于现有自监督预训练策略和监督基线，尤其在标签稀缺和多对比度设置下表现突出。

Conclusion: BrainFound为3D神经影像提供了可扩展的实用解决方案，具有临床部署和研究创新的重要潜力，能显著减少对专家标注的依赖。

Abstract: Foundation models in artificial intelligence (AI) are transforming medical
imaging by enabling general-purpose feature learning from large-scale,
unlabeled datasets. In this work, we introduce BrainFound, a self-supervised
foundation model for brain MRI, built by extending DINO-v2, a vision
transformer originally designed for 2D natural images. BrainFound adapts
DINO-v2 to model full 3D brain anatomy by incorporating volumetric information
from sequential MRI slices, moving beyond conventional single-slice paradigms.
It supports both single- and multimodal inputs, enabling a broad range of
downstream tasks, including disease detection and image segmentation, while
generalising across varied imaging protocols and clinical scenarios. We show
that BrainFound consistently outperforms existing self-supervised pretraining
strategies and supervised baselines, particularly in label-scarce and
multi-contrast settings. By integrating information from diverse 3D MRI
modalities (e.g., T1, T2, FLAIR), it enhances diagnostic accuracy and reduces
dependency on extensive expert annotations. This flexibility makes BrainFound a
scalable and practical solution for 3D neuroimaging pipelines, with significant
potential for clinical deployment and research innovation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决城市环境中点云密度、噪声特性和遮挡场景变化带来的挑战，这些在繁华城市中心很常见。

Method: 引入两种方法：1) 半球检查预处理技术，通过识别相互正交的平面表面来优化分割MLS轨迹数据；2) 平面体素化广义迭代最近点方法，在体素分区中选择性利用平面表面进行精细配准。

Result: 在慕尼黑内城真实数据集上的实验表明，该工作流程实现了亚0.01米的平均配准精度，同时显著缩短了处理时间，计算时间比传统点对面ICP方法减少50%以上。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在推进自动化3D城市建模和更新方面具有潜力，可直接应用于城市规划、基础设施管理和动态城市监测。

Abstract: This study presents a novel workflow designed to efficiently and accurately
register large-scale mobile laser scanning (MLS) point clouds to a target model
point cloud in urban street scenarios. This workflow specifically targets the
complexities inherent in urban environments and adeptly addresses the
challenges of integrating point clouds that vary in density, noise
characteristics, and occlusion scenarios, which are common in bustling city
centers. Two methodological advancements are introduced. First, the proposed
Semi-sphere Check (SSC) preprocessing technique optimally fragments MLS
trajectory data by identifying mutually orthogonal planar surfaces. This step
reduces the impact of MLS drift on the accuracy of the entire point cloud
registration, while ensuring sufficient geometric features within each fragment
to avoid local minima. Second, we propose Planar Voxel-based Generalized
Iterative Closest Point (PV-GICP), a fine registration method that selectively
utilizes planar surfaces within voxel partitions. This pre-process strategy not
only improves registration accuracy but also reduces computation time by more
than 50% compared to conventional point-to-plane ICP methods. Experiments on
real-world datasets from Munich's inner city demonstrate that our workflow
achieves sub-0.01 m average registration accuracy while significantly
shortening processing times. The results underscore the potential of the
proposed methods to advance automated 3D urban modeling and updating, with
direct applications in urban planning, infrastructure management, and dynamic
city monitoring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在CAD逆向工程中存在局限性：自下而上的几何驱动方法无法生成完全参数化输出，自上而下的策略忽略细粒度几何细节，且都忽视了草图级约束这一CAD建模的关键要素。

Method: 受人类设计师手动操作启发，利用多平面截面提取2D模式，更有效地捕捉精细参数细节，将草图约束直接整合到重建过程中。

Result: 能够重建详细且可编辑的CAD模型，在性能上超越了现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法首次实现了在CAD逆向工程中直接整合草图约束，为从3D扫描到参数化CAD表示的转换提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a foundational role in modern manufacturing
and product development, often requiring designers to modify or build upon
existing models. Converting 3D scans into parametric CAD representations--a
process known as CAD reverse engineering--remains a significant challenge due
to the high precision and structural complexity of CAD models. Existing deep
learning-based approaches typically fall into two categories: bottom-up,
geometry-driven methods, which often fail to produce fully parametric outputs,
and top-down strategies, which tend to overlook fine-grained geometric details.
Moreover, current methods neglect an essential aspect of CAD modeling:
sketch-level constraints. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to CAD
reverse engineering inspired by how human designers manually perform the task.
Our method leverages multi-plane cross-sections to extract 2D patterns and
capture fine parametric details more effectively. It enables the reconstruction
of detailed and editable CAD models, outperforming state-of-the-art methods
and, for the first time, incorporating sketch constraints directly into the
reconstruction process.

TL;DR: CURVETE是一种新颖的深度卷积神经网络，通过课程学习和渐进式自监督训练解决医学图像分析中样本有限和类别分布不均衡的问题，在三个医学图像数据集上取得了优越的分类性能。


<details>

Result: 在脑肿瘤数据集上准确率达96.60%，数字膝关节X射线数据集上75.60%，Mini-DDSM数据集上93.35%（基于ResNet-50）；基于DenseNet-121分别达到95.77%、80.36%和93.22%，均优于其他训练策略。

Conclusion: CURVETE通过课程学习和渐进式自监督训练有效解决了医学图像分析中的样本限制和类别不均衡问题，显著提升了分类性能，为医学图像分析提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Identifying high-quality and easily accessible annotated samples poses a
notable challenge in medical image analysis. Transfer learning techniques,
leveraging pre-training data, offer a flexible solution to this issue. However,
the impact of fine-tuning diminishes when the dataset exhibits an irregular
distribution between classes. This paper introduces a novel deep convolutional
neural network, named Curriculum Learning and Progressive Self-supervised
Training (CURVETE). CURVETE addresses challenges related to limited samples,
enhances model generalisability, and improves overall classification
performance. It achieves this by employing a curriculum learning strategy based
on the granularity of sample decomposition during the training of generic
unlabelled samples. Moreover, CURVETE address the challenge of irregular class
distribution by incorporating a class decomposition approach in the downstream
task. The proposed method undergoes evaluation on three distinct medical image
datasets: brain tumour, digital knee x-ray, and Mini-DDSM datasets. We
investigate the classification performance using a generic self-supervised
sample decomposition approach with and without the curriculum learning
component in training the pretext task. Experimental results demonstrate that
the CURVETE model achieves superior performance on test sets with an accuracy
of 96.60% on the brain tumour dataset, 75.60% on the digital knee x-ray
dataset, and 93.35% on the Mini-DDSM dataset using the baseline ResNet-50.
Furthermore, with the baseline DenseNet-121, it achieved accuracies of 95.77%,
80.36%, and 93.22% on the brain tumour, digital knee x-ray, and Mini-DDSM
datasets, respectively, outperforming other training strategies.

Result: 在多个下游任务中表现优异，暗光目标检测提升2.2 mAP，夜间分割提升2.9 mIoU。

Conclusion: FRBNet作为即插即用模块，无需修改损失函数即可集成到现有网络中，有效提升低光视觉任务的性能。

Abstract: Low-light vision remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision due to
severe illumination degradation, which significantly affects the performance of
downstream tasks such as detection and segmentation. While recent
state-of-the-art methods have improved performance through invariant feature
learning modules, they still fall short due to incomplete modeling of low-light
conditions. Therefore, we revisit low-light image formation and extend the
classical Lambertian model to better characterize low-light conditions. By
shifting our analysis to the frequency domain, we theoretically prove that the
frequency-domain channel ratio can be leveraged to extract
illumination-invariant features via a structured filtering process. We then
propose a novel and end-to-end trainable module named \textbf{F}requency-domain
\textbf{R}adial \textbf{B}asis \textbf{Net}work (\textbf{FRBNet}), which
integrates the frequency-domain channel ratio operation with a learnable
frequency domain filter for the overall illumination-invariant feature
enhancement. As a plug-and-play module, FRBNet can be integrated into existing
networks for low-light downstream tasks without modifying loss functions.
Extensive experiments across various downstream tasks demonstrate that FRBNet
achieves superior performance, including +2.2 mAP for dark object detection and
+2.9 mIoU for nighttime segmentation. Code is available at:

Abstract: Recent advances in image reasoning methods, particularly "Thinking with
Images", have demonstrated remarkable success in Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs); however, this dynamic reasoning paradigm has not yet been
extended to video reasoning tasks. In this paper, we propose Video-Thinker,
which empowers MLLMs to think with videos by autonomously leveraging their
intrinsic "grounding" and "captioning" capabilities to generate reasoning clues
throughout the inference process. To spark this capability, we construct
Video-Thinker-10K, a curated dataset featuring autonomous tool usage within
chain-of-thought reasoning sequences. Our training strategy begins with
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to learn the reasoning format, followed by Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to strengthen this reasoning capability.
Through this approach, Video-Thinker enables MLLMs to autonomously navigate
grounding and captioning tasks for video reasoning, eliminating the need for
constructing and calling external tools. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Video-Thinker achieves significant performance gains on both in-domain tasks
and challenging out-of-domain video reasoning benchmarks, including
Video-Holmes, CG-Bench-Reasoning, and VRBench. Our Video-Thinker-7B
substantially outperforms existing baselines such as Video-R1 and establishes

Motivation: 现有协同感知数据集通常局限于单个交叉口或单一车辆，缺乏多车辆和多基础设施传感器在多个交叉口的数据，限制了算法在不同交通环境中的基准测试。

Method: 收集了34个时间对齐和空间校准的传感器序列，每个序列持续20秒，包含来自三个交叉口之一的记录，涉及两辆车和最多三个基础设施传感器杆。

Result: 数据集包含12个车载RGB相机、2个车载LiDAR、17个基础设施热成像相机和12个基础设施LiDAR的数据，共约712k个标注实例，涵盖13个对象类别。

Conclusion: 提供了基于最先进协同感知方法的全面评估，并公开了代码库、数据集、高清地图和完整数据收集环境的数字孪生。

Abstract: Recent cooperative perception datasets have played a crucial role in
advancing smart mobility applications by enabling information exchange between
intelligent agents, helping to overcome challenges such as occlusions and
improving overall scene understanding. While some existing real-world datasets
incorporate both vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure interactions,
they are typically limited to a single intersection or a single vehicle. A
comprehensive perception dataset featuring multiple connected vehicles and
infrastructure sensors across several intersections remains unavailable,
limiting the benchmarking of algorithms in diverse traffic environments.
Consequently, overfitting can occur, and models may demonstrate misleadingly
high performance due to similar intersection layouts and traffic participant
behavior. To address this gap, we introduce UrbanIng-V2X, the first
large-scale, multi-modal dataset supporting cooperative perception involving
vehicles and infrastructure sensors deployed across three urban intersections
in Ingolstadt, Germany. UrbanIng-V2X consists of 34 temporally aligned and
spatially calibrated sensor sequences, each lasting 20 seconds. All sequences
contain recordings from one of three intersections, involving two vehicles and
up to three infrastructure-mounted sensor poles operating in coordinated
scenarios. In total, UrbanIng-V2X provides data from 12 vehicle-mounted RGB
cameras, 2 vehicle LiDARs, 17 infrastructure thermal cameras, and 12
infrastructure LiDARs. All sequences are annotated at a frequency of 10 Hz with
3D bounding boxes spanning 13 object classes, resulting in approximately 712k
annotated instances across the dataset. We provide comprehensive evaluations
using state-of-the-art cooperative perception methods and publicly release the
codebase, dataset, HD map, and a digital twin of the complete data collection
environment.

TL;DR: MergeMix提出了一种结合监督微调(SFT)和强化学习(RL)的训练时增强范式，通过注意力感知的图像混合和偏好驱动训练来提升多模态大语言模型的视觉-语言对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SFT方法需要大规模人工标注且无法捕捉细微偏好，而RL方法虽然引入奖励信号但存在开销大和不稳定的问题。需要一种在可扩展性、鲁棒性和对齐质量之间取得平衡的解决方案。

Method: 1. 通过token合并进行注意力感知的图像混合，保留更多聚类表示和空间上下文；2. 使用混合图像和原始图像构建偏好对；3. 通过SimPO损失进行优化，实现偏好驱动的训练范式。

Result: MergeMix在分类任务中超越了其他基于启发式的方法，增强了注意力一致性和效率，在保持竞争力的准确率的同时提高了训练效率。

Conclusion: MergeMix为分类和多模态大语言模型中的偏好对齐提供了一种可扩展的方法，有效解决了SFT和RL方法各自的局限性。

Abstract: Vision-language alignment in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs)
typically relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning
(RL). SFT is stable and efficient but requires large-scale human annotations
and cannot capture subtle preferences, while RL brings in a reward signal for
training, but suffers from overhead and instability. These limitations
highlight a trade-off between scalability, robustness, and alignment quality.
To address this, we propose MergeMix, a training-time augmentation paradigm
that bridges SFT and RL. It first applies an attention-aware image mixing via
token merge with more cluster representation and spatial context, and then
presents a preference-driven training paradigm for MLLMs by building preference
pairs with mixed images and raw images, and optimizing via SimPO loss. As a
mixup augmentation, MergeMix enhances attention consistency and efficiency,
surpassing other heuristic-based methods in classification. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MergeMix achieves competitive accuracy with
improved efficiency, providing a scalable approach to preference alignment in
classification and MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文发现大型视觉语言模型生成的视觉-文本多模态思维链存在不忠实问题，视觉信息往往不准确但答案正确。作者提出了一种自动评估指标和SCCM学习策略来提升视觉忠实度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型通过强化微调生成的多模态思维链中，视觉信息经常不准确但答案仍然正确，表明推理过程缺乏忠实性。这源于RL奖励只激励视觉-文本交替格式，而不考虑视觉信息的正确性。

Method: 首先通过干预实验探究MCoT的忠实性，然后提出自动化LVLM评估指标从可靠性和充分性两个角度量化视觉线索的忠实度。为解决该问题，提出SCCM学习策略，鼓励生成足够但最少的视觉组件。

Result: 评估显示当前MCoT轨迹中的视觉信息同时不可靠且不充分。SCCM方法在多个细粒度感知和推理基准上一致提高了视觉忠实度。

Conclusion: 提出的SCCM学习策略能够有效提升多模态思维链的视觉忠实度，该方法无需标注且可与各种RFT方法即插即用。

Abstract: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) can generate vision-text
multimodal chain-of-thought (MCoT) traces after reinforcement fine-tuning
(RFT). However, we observe that the visual information incorporated in MCoT is
often inaccurate, though still yield correct answers, indicating a lack of
faithfulness in the MCoT reasoning process. We attribute this unfaithfulness to
the RL reward in RFT, which solely incentivizes the format of interleaved
vision-text cues, ie, it encourages the model to incorporate visual information
into its text reasoning steps without considering the correctness of the visual
information. In this paper, we first probe the faithfulness of MCoT by
measuring how much the prediction changes when its visual and textual thoughts
are intervened. Surprisingly, the model's predictions remain nearly unchanged
under visual intervention but change significantly under textual intervention,
indicating that the visual evidence is largely ignored. To further analyze
visual information, we introduce an automated LVLM-based evaluation metric that
quantifies the faithfulness of visual cues from two perspectives: reliability
and sufficiency. Our evaluation reveals that the visual information in current
MCoT traces is simultaneously unreliable and insufficient. To address this
issue, we propose a novel MCoT learning strategy termed Sufficient-Component
Cause Model (SCCM) learning. This approach encourages the MCoT to generate
sufficient yet minimal visual components that are independently capable of
leading to correct answers. We note that the proposed SCCM is annotation-free
and compatible with various RFT for MCoT in a plug-and-play manner. Empirical
results demonstrate that SCCM consistently improves the visual faithfulness
across a suite of fine-grained perception and reasoning benchmarks. Code is
available at https://github.com/EugeneLiu01/Faithful_Thinking_with_Image.

challenging task, i.a. due to the scarcity of high-quality image-text reasoning
data. Conversely, text-based reasoning resources are abundant and scalable, but
it is still an open question how to leveraging them for VLM reasoning. To
address this problem, we propose VOLD, a framework to transfer reasoning
capabilities from text-only teacher models to VLM student models. To this end,
VOLD combines reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) with on-policy distillation, which allows the student reasoning traces
to be guided by the teacher model, resulting in a significant gain over using
GRPO alone. We further show that a cold-start alignment is essential for an
effective transfer during the online training phase in this scenario and that
without sufficient distributional alignment between teacher and student,
on-policy distillation fails to provide meaningful guidance. We evaluate VOLD
across diverse benchmarks including MMMU-Pro, MathVision, MathVista, and
LogicVista, showing that VOLD outperforms the baseline model significantly and
improves over the state of the art by a margin. Our ablation shows the
importance of a cold-start alignment via SFT for on-policy distillation with a
text-only teacher.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图神经网络在图像分类中未能充分考虑视觉实体间的底层结构和关系，限制了其性能表现。

Method: iPac整合了补丁划分、特征提取、聚类、图构建和图学习等多个阶段，通过捕捉相关特征并组织成簇来构建有意义的图表示。

Result: 在多种医学图像数据集上的实验表明，iPac相比基线方法平均准确率提升高达5%。

Conclusion: iPac为图像分类，特别是医学图像分类，提供了一个通用且有效的解决方案，通过利用图表示并考虑视觉实体间的内在结构和关系。

Abstract: Graph neural networks have emerged as a promising paradigm for image
processing, yet their performance in image classification tasks is hindered by
a limited consideration of the underlying structure and relationships among
visual entities. This work presents iPac, a novel approach to introduce a new
graph representation of images to enhance graph neural network image
classification by recognizing the importance of underlying structure and
relationships in medical image classification. iPac integrates various stages,
including patch partitioning, feature extraction, clustering, graph
construction, and graph-based learning, into a unified network to advance graph
neural network image classification. By capturing relevant features and
organising them into clusters, we construct a meaningful graph representation
that effectively encapsulates the semantics of the image. Experimental
evaluation on diverse medical image datasets demonstrates the efficacy of iPac,
exhibiting an average accuracy improvement of up to 5% over baseline methods.
Our approach offers a versatile and generic solution for image classification,
particularly in the realm of medical images, by leveraging the graph
representation and accounting for the inherent structure and relationships
among visual entities.

*Yaoli Liu,Yao-Xiang Ding,Kun Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeFuse是一种无需训练的多主体文本到图像生成方法，通过自动融合多个主体LoRA，利用交叉注意力层权重动态生成主体掩码，实现高质量的多主体生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么依赖预推理的LoRA权重合并，要么需要分割模型和复杂的噪声混合技术来隔离LoRA输出，这些方法存在效率低、实用性差的问题。

Method: 通过分析交叉注意力层权重自动生成上下文感知的动态主体掩码，在推理过程中直接将这些掩码应用于LoRA输出，无需额外训练或修改LoRA。

Result: 实验验证FreeFuse在多主体生成任务中，在生成质量和可用性方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FreeFuse提供了一种实用高效的多主体生成解决方案，无需额外训练、模型修改或用户定义模板，仅需提供LoRA激活词即可无缝集成到标准工作流程中。

Abstract: This paper proposes FreeFuse, a novel training-free approach for
multi-subject text-to-image generation through automatic fusion of multiple
subject LoRAs. In contrast to existing methods that either focus on
pre-inference LoRA weight merging or rely on segmentation models and complex
techniques like noise blending to isolate LoRA outputs, our key insight is that
context-aware dynamic subject masks can be automatically derived from
cross-attention layer weights. Mathematical analysis shows that directly
applying these masks to LoRA outputs during inference well approximates the
case where the subject LoRA is integrated into the diffusion model and used
individually for the masked region. FreeFuse demonstrates superior practicality
and efficiency as it requires no additional training, no modification to LoRAs,
no auxiliary models, and no user-defined prompt templates or region
specifications. Alternatively, it only requires users to provide the LoRA
activation words for seamless integration into standard workflows. Extensive
experiments validate that FreeFuse outperforms existing approaches in both
generation quality and usability under the multi-subject generation tasks. The

TL;DR: 提出动态伪标签过滤方案和先验引导数据增强管道，提升点云语义分割的无监督域自适应性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实LiDAR点云标注成本高，现有自训练方法未能有效利用未标记数据，依赖固定置信度阈值导致性能不佳

Method: 动态伪标签过滤(DPLF)、先验引导数据增强管道(PG-DAP)、数据混合一致性损失

Result: 在两个合成到真实点云语义分割任务上实现优越性能，消融研究证实DPLF和PG-DAP模块有效性

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效提升点云无监督域自适应语义分割性能，代码已开源

Abstract: Annotating real-world LiDAR point clouds for use in intelligent autonomous
systems is costly. To overcome this limitation, self-training-based
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has been widely used to improve point
cloud semantic segmentation by leveraging synthetic point cloud data. However,
we argue that existing methods do not effectively utilize unlabeled data, as
they either rely on predefined or fixed confidence thresholds, resulting in
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Pseudo-Label
Filtering (DPLF) scheme to enhance real data utilization in point cloud UDA
semantic segmentation. Additionally, we design a simple and efficient
Prior-Guided Data Augmentation Pipeline (PG-DAP) to mitigate domain shift
between synthetic and real-world point clouds. Finally, we utilize data mixing
consistency loss to push the model to learn context-free representations. We
implement and thoroughly evaluate our approach through extensive comparisons
with state-of-the-art methods. Experiments on two challenging synthetic-to-real
point cloud semantic segmentation tasks demonstrate that our approach achieves
superior performance. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the DPLF
and PG-DAP modules. We release the code of our method in this paper.

Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型擅长可见事件推理，但缺乏具身的第一人称理解能力，无法有效推理自我中心视频中不可观察的智能体意图和细粒度交互。

Method: 构建EgoRe-5M大规模自我中心问答数据集，包含1300万个视频片段，带有详细思维链推理和密集手-物体定位标注；采用两阶段学习：首先通过监督微调培养推理技能，然后通过强化微调增强时空定位能力。

Result: EgoThinker在多个自我中心基准测试中优于现有方法，在细粒度时空定位任务上取得显著改进。

Conclusion: 该框架成功赋予多模态大语言模型自我中心推理能力，解决了第一人称视频理解的核心挑战。

Abstract: Egocentric video reasoning centers on an unobservable agent behind the camera
who dynamically shapes the environment, requiring inference of hidden
intentions and recognition of fine-grained interactions. This core challenge
limits current multimodal large language models MLLMs, which excel at visible
event reasoning but lack embodied, first-person understanding. To bridge this
gap, we introduce EgoThinker, a novel framework that endows MLLMs with robust
egocentric reasoning capabilities through spatio-temporal chain-of-thought
supervision and a two-stage learning curriculum. First, we introduce EgoRe-5M,
a large-scale egocentric QA dataset constructed from 13M diverse egocentric
video clips. This dataset features multi-minute segments annotated with
detailed CoT rationales and dense hand-object grounding. Second, we employ SFT
on EgoRe-5M to instill reasoning skills, followed by reinforcement fine-tuning
RFT to further enhance spatio-temporal localization. Experimental results show
that EgoThinker outperforms existing methods across multiple egocentric
benchmarks, while achieving substantial improvements in fine-grained
spatio-temporal localization tasks. Full code and data are released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的生成式深度估计方法在训练时会导致预训练模型的图像生成能力严重退化。作者希望开发一个既能进行深度估计又能保持原始图像生成能力的统一模型。

Method: 提出MERGE框架，包含可插拔转换器实现图像生成和深度估计模式切换，采用组重用机制提高参数利用率，基于固定的预训练文本到图像模型构建。

Result: MERGE在多个深度估计基准测试中达到最先进性能，同时完全保留了预训练模型的图像生成能力。

Conclusion: 预训练文本到图像模型不仅可用于图像生成，还能轻松扩展到深度估计任务，MERGE成功释放了这种潜力而不会损害原始能力。

Abstract: Generative depth estimation methods leverage the rich visual priors stored in
pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating astonishing zero-shot
capability. However, parameter updates during training lead to catastrophic
degradation in the image generation capability of the pre-trained model. We
introduce MERGE, a unified model for image generation and depth estimation,
starting from a fixed pre-trained text-to-image model. MERGE demonstrates that
the pre-trained text-to-image model can do more than image generation, but also
expand to depth estimation effortlessly. Specifically, MERGE introduces a
play-and-plug framework that enables seamless switching between image
generation and depth estimation modes through simple and pluggable converters.
Meanwhile, we propose a Group Reuse Mechanism to encourage parameter reuse and
improve the utilization of the additional learnable parameters. MERGE unleashes
the powerful depth estimation capability of the pre-trained text-to-image model
while preserving its original image generation ability. Compared to other
unified models for image generation and depth estimation, MERGE achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple depth estimation benchmarks. The
code will be made available at https://github.com/H-EmbodVis/MERGE

TL;DR: 提出Lookahead Anchoring方法，通过利用未来时间步的关键帧作为方向性锚点，解决音频驱动人体动画中的身份漂移问题，无需额外关键帧生成阶段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频驱动人体动画模型在时间自回归生成过程中容易出现身份漂移问题，现有使用关键帧作为时间锚点的方法需要额外生成阶段且可能限制自然运动动态。

Method: 提出前瞻锚定方法，利用当前生成窗口前方的未来时间步关键帧作为方向性信标，模型在响应即时音频线索的同时持续追踪这些未来锚点，实现身份一致性保持。

Result: 在三种最新人体动画模型上应用该方法，实现了更好的唇形同步、身份保持和视觉质量，在多种不同架构上都显示出改进的时间条件化效果。

Conclusion: 前瞻锚定方法通过将关键帧从固定边界转变为方向性信标，有效解决了身份漂移问题，且前瞻距离自然控制表达性与一致性的平衡。

Abstract: Audio-driven human animation models often suffer from identity drift during
temporal autoregressive generation, where characters gradually lose their
identity over time. One solution is to generate keyframes as intermediate
temporal anchors that prevent degradation, but this requires an additional
keyframe generation stage and can restrict natural motion dynamics. To address
this, we propose Lookahead Anchoring, which leverages keyframes from future
timesteps ahead of the current generation window, rather than within it. This
transforms keyframes from fixed boundaries into directional beacons: the model
continuously pursues these future anchors while responding to immediate audio
cues, maintaining consistent identity through persistent guidance. This also
enables self-keyframing, where the reference image serves as the lookahead
target, eliminating the need for keyframe generation entirely. We find that the
temporal lookahead distance naturally controls the balance between expressivity
and consistency: larger distances allow for greater motion freedom, while
smaller ones strengthen identity adherence. When applied to three recent human
animation models, Lookahead Anchoring achieves superior lip synchronization,
identity preservation, and visual quality, demonstrating improved temporal
conditioning across several different architectures. Video results are

Motivation: 直接建模原始数据分布的显式似然是机器学习的关键主题，但在视觉像素数据上的连续自回归建模面临序列过长和高维空间的挑战。

Method: 使用可逆自回归流将图像转换为潜在序列，通过自监督维度减少方案划分潜在通道，并设计一步蒸馏和重采样分类器自由引导算法。

Conclusion: FARMER成功统一了归一化流和自回归模型，解决了像素级建模的冗余和复杂性问题，实现了高效的图像生成和似然估计。

Abstract: Directly modeling the explicit likelihood of the raw data distribution is key
topic in the machine learning area, which achieves the scaling successes in
Large Language Models by autoregressive modeling. However, continuous AR
modeling over visual pixel data suffer from extremely long sequences and
high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we present FARMER, a novel end-to-end
generative framework that unifies Normalizing Flows (NF) and Autoregressive
(AR) models for tractable likelihood estimation and high-quality image
synthesis directly from raw pixels. FARMER employs an invertible autoregressive
flow to transform images into latent sequences, whose distribution is modeled
implicitly by an autoregressive model. To address the redundancy and complexity
in pixel-level modeling, we propose a self-supervised dimension reduction
scheme that partitions NF latent channels into informative and redundant
groups, enabling more effective and efficient AR modeling. Furthermore, we
design a one-step distillation scheme to significantly accelerate inference
speed and introduce a resampling-based classifier-free guidance algorithm to
boost image generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FARMER
achieves competitive performance compared to existing pixel-based generative
models while providing exact likelihoods and scalable training.

Motivation: 现有3D算法通常假设相机内参在视频中保持不变，但实际视频中内参经常变化，且缺乏动态内参的基准数据集。

Method: 构建包含386个高分辨率室内外视频的基准数据集，扩展Kalibr工具箱提高标定精度和鲁棒性，建立全面的查找表确保逐帧内参准确性。

Result: 创建了包含143K+标注帧的大规模数据集，评估发现现有方法在动态内参视频上难以实现准确预测。

Conclusion: InFlux基准填补了动态相机内参评估的空白，为相关研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Accurately tracking camera intrinsics is crucial for achieving 3D
understanding from 2D video. However, most 3D algorithms assume that camera
intrinsics stay constant throughout a video, which is often not true for many
real-world in-the-wild videos. A major obstacle in this field is a lack of
dynamic camera intrinsics benchmarks--existing benchmarks typically offer
limited diversity in scene content and intrinsics variation, and none provide
per-frame intrinsic changes for consecutive video frames. In this paper, we
present Intrinsics in Flux (InFlux), a real-world benchmark that provides
per-frame ground truth intrinsics annotations for videos with dynamic
intrinsics. Compared to prior benchmarks, InFlux captures a wider range of
intrinsic variations and scene diversity, featuring 143K+ annotated frames from
386 high-resolution indoor and outdoor videos with dynamic camera intrinsics.
To ensure accurate per-frame intrinsics, we build a comprehensive lookup table
of calibration experiments and extend the Kalibr toolbox to improve its
accuracy and robustness. Using our benchmark, we evaluate existing baseline
methods for predicting camera intrinsics and find that most struggle to achieve
accurate predictions on videos with dynamic intrinsics. For the dataset, code,

TL;DR: PRISM-Bench是一个基于谜题的视觉挑战基准，通过要求模型识别推理链中的第一个错误步骤来评估其逻辑一致性和推理能力，而不仅仅是最终答案准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法只关注最终答案准确性，无法评估模型的推理过程是否忠实可靠。需要一种诊断性评估来揭示模型在生成流畅推理链和实际逻辑一致性之间的差距。

Method: 创建包含多步符号、几何和类比推理的视觉谜题，每个谜题附带包含一个错误的逐步推理链，要求模型识别第一个错误步骤。

Result: 评估显示最先进的多模态大模型在生成合理推理链和定位简单逻辑错误之间存在显著差距，模型往往无法准确识别推理过程中的错误。

Conclusion: PRISM-Bench提供了更精细的多模态推理能力评估框架，强调了在开发可信赖MLLM时需要诊断性评估协议的重要性。

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{PRISM-Bench}, a benchmark of puzzle-based visual
challenges designed to evaluate not only whether models can solve problems, but
how their reasoning unfolds. Unlike prior evaluations that measure only
final-answer accuracy, PRISM-Bench introduces a diagnostic task: given a visual
puzzle and a step-by-step chain-of-thought (CoT) containing exactly one error,
models must identify the first incorrect step. This setting enables
fine-grained assessment of logical consistency, error detection, and visual
reasoning. The puzzles in PRISM-Bench require multi-step symbolic, geometric,
and analogical reasoning, resisting shortcuts based on superficial pattern
matching. Evaluations across state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal a persistent gap
between fluent generation and faithful reasoning: models that produce plausible
CoTs often fail to locate simple logical faults. By disentangling answer
generation from reasoning verification, PRISM-Bench offers a sharper lens on
multimodal reasoning competence and underscores the need for diagnostic
evaluation protocols in the development of trustworthy MLLMs.

Method: 提出尺度自适应对象分词器(SAOT)生成紧凑的对象表示，以及对象中心注入模块预融合全局上下文，构建轻量级的仅对象框架。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，PixelRefer以较少训练样本实现领先性能，PixelRefer-Lite在保持竞争力的同时显著提升效率。

Conclusion: PixelRefer框架在细粒度视觉理解任务上表现出色，其轻量级变体在效率和准确性之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong
general-purpose capabilities in open-world visual comprehension. However, most
existing MLLMs primarily focus on holistic, scene-level understanding, often
overlooking the need for fine-grained, object-centric reasoning. In this paper,
we present PixelRefer, a unified region-level MLLM framework that enables
advanced fine-grained understanding over user-specified regions across both
images and videos. Motivated by the observation that LLM attention
predominantly focuses on object-level tokens, we propose a Scale-Adaptive
Object Tokenizer (SAOT) to generate compact and semantically rich object
representations from free-form regions. Our analysis reveals that global visual
tokens contribute mainly in early LLM layers, inspiring the design of
PixelRefer-Lite, an efficient variant that employs an Object-Centric Infusion
module to pre-fuse global context into object tokens. This yields a lightweight
Object-Only Framework that substantially reduces computational cost while
maintaining high semantic fidelity. To facilitate fine-grained instruction
tuning, we curate PixelRefer-2.2M, a high-quality object-centric instruction
dataset. Extensive experiments across a range of benchmarks validate that
PixelRefer achieves leading performance with fewer training samples, while
PixelRefer-Lite offers competitive accuracy with notable gains in efficiency.

Conclusion: Concerto产生了具有卓越细粒度几何和语义一致性的空间表征，支持开放世界感知。

Abstract: Humans learn abstract concepts through multisensory synergy, and once formed,
such representations can often be recalled from a single modality. Inspired by
this principle, we introduce Concerto, a minimalist simulation of human concept
learning for spatial cognition, combining 3D intra-modal self-distillation with
2D-3D cross-modal joint embedding. Despite its simplicity, Concerto learns more
coherent and informative spatial features, as demonstrated by zero-shot
visualizations. It outperforms both standalone SOTA 2D and 3D self-supervised
models by 14.2% and 4.8%, respectively, as well as their feature concatenation,
in linear probing for 3D scene perception. With full fine-tuning, Concerto sets
new SOTA results across multiple scene understanding benchmarks (e.g., 80.7%
mIoU on ScanNet). We further present a variant of Concerto tailored for
video-lifted point cloud spatial understanding, and a translator that linearly
projects Concerto representations into CLIP's language space, enabling
open-world perception. These results highlight that Concerto emerges spatial
representations with superior fine-grained geometric and semantic consistency.

Motivation: 研究当严格思维链格式约束被放松为开放式结构时，政策优化算法的行为表现，填补这一研究空白。

Method: 通过一系列受控实验和奖励分解实验，分析政策优化在不同模型和算法中的行为模式。

Result: 政策优化始终选择最简单的奖励组件，即使复杂格式被赋予4倍奖励权重，仍会退化为仅输出答案的格式。

Conclusion: 给予政策优化自由度是一把双刃剑：既能发现高奖励捷径，也会导致奖励函数被简单化利用，这对对齐任务构成挑战。

Abstract: Policy optimization (PO) algorithms are used to refine Large Language Models
for complex, multi-step reasoning. Current state-of-the-art pipelines enforce a
strict think-then-answer format to elicit chain-of-thought (CoT); however, the
behavior of PO when these rigid constraints are relaxed into an open-ended CoT
structure remains an under-studied question. We investigate this gap with an
extensive suite of controlled experiments and identify a consistent principle:
\textit{policy optimization consistently follows the path of least resistance}.
When afforded the flexibility to interleave reasoning and response, policy
optimization consistently learns to discard explicit reasoning, causing the
policy to degenerate to a direct \texttt{<answer>}-only format. This outcome
holds true across various models and algorithms. We find that this collapse in
format is persistent even when the complex \texttt{<think><answer>} format is
assigned up to 4x larger reward weights. We formalize this principle through a
series of controlled reward decomposition experiments, demonstrating a clear
hierarchy: PO systematically optimizes for the simplest reward component first,
a preference that holds even when faced with mutually exclusive choices or
strong incentives for more complex behaviors. Finally, we show that successful
convergence on the high-reward shortcut is not a low-effort drift but is driven
by the optimization process that requires the KL-regularized policy to have
sufficient freedom to make a significant shift from its initial prior. Our
findings reveal that granting policies the freedom to diverge is a double-edged
sword: while necessary for discovering high-reward shortcuts, it also creates a
powerful incentive to game the simplest aspects of the reward function, posing
a critical challenge for reward hacking under alignment.

Abstract: Conventional research on large language models (LLMs) has primarily focused
on refining output distributions, while paying less attention to the decoding
process that transforms these distributions into final responses. Recent
advances, such as scaling the computation of inference time with reward models,
have underscored the importance of decoding, but these methods often suffer
from high computational costs and limited applicability. In this paper, we
revisit LLM generation through the lens of recommender systems, conceptualizing
the decoding process as analogous to the ranking stage in recommendation
pipelines. From this perspective, we observe that both traditional decoding
methods and reward models exhibit clear limitations such as redundancy.
Motivated by this insight, we propose Language Ranker, a novel framework that
introduces a lightweight module to rerank candidate responses using features
extracted by the base model. Experiments across a wide range of tasks show that
Language Ranker achieves performance comparable to large-scale reward models,
while requiring only <0.5M additional parameters, significantly reducing the
computational overhead during both training and inference stages. This
highlights the efficiency and effectiveness of our method, showcasing its
potential to fully unlock the capabilities of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RACE框架评估LLM生成解释与逻辑回归特征重要性之间的对齐度，发现正确预测更覆盖支持特征，错误预测更覆盖矛盾特征，揭示了LLM解释的忠实性模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习在敏感领域的应用增加，对透明可解释AI的需求日益增长。虽然LLM能生成自然语言解释，但这些解释是否真实反映决策依据尚不明确。

Method: 提出RACE框架，通过逻辑回归基线获取可解释特征重要性分数，使用token匹配、精确字符串匹配和编辑距离匹配技术，在四个文本分类数据集上分析LLM解释与特征的对齐度。

Result: 实证结果显示一致的不对称性：正确预测对支持特征覆盖更高，错误预测对矛盾特征覆盖更高。编辑距离匹配揭示了释义重叠，增强了覆盖率但保持不对称性。

Conclusion: LLM解释结合了表面层和灵活的证据复用，但在错误情况下也会放大误导线索。RACE为评估神经语言模型推理完整性提供了量化基础。

Abstract: The growing adoption of machine learning (ML) in sensitive domains has
heightened the demand for transparent and interpretable artificial
intelligence. Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of
producing natural language explanations, yet it remains unclear whether these
rationales faithfully capture the predictive signals that underlie decisions.
This paper introduces RACE-Reasoning Alignment for Completeness of
Explanations, a systematic framework to evaluate the alignment between
LLM-generated explanations and interpretable feature importance scores derived
from a logistic regression baseline. We analyze four widely used text
classification datasets-WIKI ONTOLOGY, AG NEWS, IMDB, and GOEMOTIONS-and
compare LLM rationales against top-ranked supporting and contradicting lexical
features. To capture alignment at multiple levels of granularity, RACE
implements token-aware, exact string, and edit-distance matching techniques.
Empirical results reveal a consistent asymmetry: correct predictions exhibit
higher coverage of supporting features, while incorrect predictions are
associated with elevated coverage of contradicting features. Edit-distance
matching further uncovers paraphrastic overlaps, boosting coverage while
preserving this asymmetry. These findings demonstrate that LLM rationales
combine both surface-level and flexible evidence reuse, yet can also amplify
misleading cues in error cases. RACE provides new insights into the
faithfulness of LLM explanations and establishes a quantitative basis for
evaluating reasoning completeness in neural language models.

TL;DR: 提出行为感知采样框架，通过基于指令-响应行为和语义多样性选择安全示例，有效缓解大语言模型微调时的灾难性遗忘问题，仅需0.5%额外训练数据即可将有害输出减少41%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在良性数据上微调时经常丧失之前对齐的安全行为，即灾难性遗忘现象。现有方法通过添加随机安全示例来缓解，但哪种示例最有效尚不明确。

Method: 提出行为感知采样框架，基于两个互补因素选择安全示例：指令-响应行为（如拒绝与服从）和跨伤害类别的语义多样性。

Result: 系统性评估显示该方法显著减少有害输出同时保持有用性，仅使用0.5%额外训练数据即可实现有害性降低41%。

Conclusion: 结果表明有针对性的数据选择可以大规模提高微调的安全性和效率。

Abstract: Large language models often lose previously aligned safety behaviors when
fine-tuned on benign data, a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. Prior
work shows that adding random safety examples can mitigate this effect, but it
remains unclear which examples are most effective. We propose a behavior-aware
sampling framework that selects safety examples based on two complementary
factors: instruction-response behavior (e.g., refusal versus compliance) and
semantic diversity across harm categories. Systematic evaluation shows that
this approach substantially reduces harmful outputs while maintaining
helpfulness, achieving up to a 41% reduction in harmfulness with only 0.5%
additional training data. These results highlight how targeted data selection
can improve the safety and efficiency of fine-tuning at scale.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于语义各向同性的方法来评估LLM长文本响应的可信度，通过分析嵌入向量的分布均匀性来判断事实一致性，无需标注数据或微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在需要准确回答开放式问题的高风险应用领域部署LLM时，需要可靠且计算成本低的方法来评估长文本响应的可信度。现有基于逐项事实核查的方法计算成本高且在长文本中表现脆弱。

Method: 引入语义各向同性概念，通过生成多个长文本响应，嵌入到单位球面上，计算嵌入向量的角度分散度来估计语义各向同性水平。

Result: 研究发现更高的语义各向同性（即更大的嵌入分散度）可靠地表明样本间的事实一致性较低。该方法在多个领域都优于现有方法，仅需少量样本即可预测长文本响应中的非事实性。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种实用、低成本的信任评估方法，可集成到实际的LLM工作流程中，无需标注数据、微调或超参数选择，适用于开放或封闭权重的嵌入模型。

Abstract: To deploy large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes application domains
that require substantively accurate responses to open-ended prompts, we need
reliable, computationally inexpensive methods that assess the trustworthiness
of long-form responses generated by LLMs. However, existing approaches often
rely on claim-by-claim fact-checking, which is computationally expensive and
brittle in long-form responses to open-ended prompts. In this work, we
introduce semantic isotropy -- the degree of uniformity across normalized text
embeddings on the unit sphere -- and use it to assess the trustworthiness of
long-form responses generated by LLMs. To do so, we generate several long-form
responses, embed them, and estimate the level of semantic isotropy of these
responses as the angular dispersion of the embeddings on the unit sphere. We
find that higher semantic isotropy -- that is, greater embedding dispersion --
reliably signals lower factual consistency across samples. Our approach
requires no labeled data, no fine-tuning, and no hyperparameter selection, and
can be used with open- or closed-weight embedding models. Across multiple
domains, our method consistently outperforms existing approaches in predicting
nonfactuality in long-form responses using only a handful of samples --
offering a practical, low-cost approach for integrating trust assessment into
real-world LLM workflows.

TL;DR: NetMind是一个使用自然语言查询网络行为的框架，通过树状配置分块、统一事实图和混合语言设计来解决LLM在理解复杂网络配置时的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代大规模网络配置复杂，传统基于领域特定语言的方法学习曲线陡峭且灵活性有限。自然语言界面更易访问和解释，但LLM在处理长配置、异构设备和复杂拓扑时面临挑战。

Method: 1) 树状配置分块策略保持语义连贯性；2) 构建统一事实图作为中间表示；3) 设计混合命令式-声明式语言减轻LLM推理负担。

Result: 实验表明NetMind在理解网络行为方面准确且可扩展，优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: NetMind通过创新的配置处理、统一表示和混合语言设计，有效解决了LLM在网络行为理解中的关键挑战，实现了准确可扩展的自然语言网络查询。

Abstract: Modern large-scale networks introduce significant complexity in understanding
network behaviors, increasing the risk of misconfiguration. Prior work proposed
to understand network behaviors by mining network configurations, typically
relying on domain-specific languages interfaced with formal models. While
effective, they suffer from a steep learning curve and limited flexibility. In
contrast, natural language (NL) offers a more accessible and interpretable
interface, motivating recent research on NL-guided network behavior
understanding. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) further enhance
this direction, leveraging their extensive prior knowledge of network concepts
and strong reasoning capabilities. However, three key challenges remain: 1)
numerous router devices with lengthy configuration files challenge LLM's
long-context understanding ability; 2) heterogeneity across devices and
protocols impedes scalability; and 3) complex network topologies and protocols
demand advanced reasoning abilities beyond the current capabilities of LLMs. To
tackle the above challenges, we propose NetMind, a novel framework for querying
networks using NL. Our approach introduces a tree-based configuration chunking
strategy to preserve semantic coherence while enabling efficient partitioning.
We then construct a unified fact graph as an intermediate representation to
normalize vendor-specific configurations. Finally, we design a hybrid
imperative-declarative language to reduce the reasoning burden on LLMs and
enhance precision. We contribute a benchmark consisting of NL question-answer
pairs paired with network configurations. Experiments demonstrate that NetMind
achieves accurate and scalable network behavior understanding, outperforming
existing baselines.

Motivation: 现有自动文献综述系统采用一次性检索和静态大纲生成，导致检索噪声大、结构碎片化和上下文过载，限制了综述质量。

Method: 使用规划代理增量式检索、阅读和更新大纲，设计论文卡片提取每篇论文的贡献、方法和发现，并引入审查-精炼循环和可视化增强。

Result: 在既定和新兴主题上的实验表明，该方法在内容覆盖、结构连贯性和引用质量方面显著优于现有基线，生成更易访问和组织更好的综述。

Conclusion: 该方法通过模拟人类研究者的迭代阅读过程，有效提升了自动文献综述的质量，并引入了Survey-Arena基准来更可靠地评估改进。

Abstract: Automatic literature survey generation has attracted increasing attention,
yet most existing systems follow a one-shot paradigm, where a large set of
papers is retrieved at once and a static outline is generated before drafting.
This design often leads to noisy retrieval, fragmented structures, and context
overload, ultimately limiting survey quality. Inspired by the iterative reading
process of human researchers, we propose \ours, a framework based on recurrent
outline generation, in which a planning agent incrementally retrieves, reads,
and updates the outline to ensure both exploration and coherence. To provide
faithful paper-level grounding, we design paper cards that distill each paper
into its contributions, methods, and findings, and introduce a
review-and-refine loop with visualization enhancement to improve textual flow
and integrate multimodal elements such as figures and tables. Experiments on
both established and emerging topics show that \ours\ substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in content coverage, structural coherence, and
citation quality, while producing more accessible and better-organized surveys.
To provide a more reliable assessment of such improvements, we further
introduce Survey-Arena, a pairwise benchmark that complements absolute scoring
and more clearly positions machine-generated surveys relative to human-written
ones. The code is available at

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The number of tokens it takes to encode parallel text in different languages
is known to vary. These disparities are called token premiums. Having high
token premiums leads to less throughput during training and increases costs at
inference. In this paper, we show that even after controlling for dataset size,
vocabulary size, and data content, monolingual tokenizers exhibit a wide range
of token premiums across languages. To understand the cross-linguistic
differences that cause these token premiums, we train a suite of approximately
7,000 comparable monolingual tokenizers for 97 languages, manipulating
tokenization algorithm, vocabulary size, and dataset size. We measure token
premiums and test for a relationship between factors such as data similarity
(between tokenizer training and evaluation), vocabulary size, and
pre-tokenization. We also investigate the role of language-specific features
such as writing system and word length. We find that similarity between
training and test data does not impact token premiums, but vocabulary size and
pre-tokenization do. While simply increasing vocabulary size does not lead to
reduced token premium effects, we can determine an ``optimal'' vocabulary size
for each language to achieve significantly reduced token premium effects. We
also train superword tokenizers which allow merges over whitespaces, and we
find that they both reduce token premium effects and improve compression
overall. Thus, intervening on the vocabulary size or the pre-tokenizer
significantly reduces crosslingual token premium effects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有tokenizer迁移方法主要依赖语义启发式初始化新嵌入，忽略了更高层的模型动态，限制了迁移质量。

Method: 提出Model-Aware Tokenizer Transfer (MATT)，引入Attention Influence Modeling (AIM)目标，在标准语言建模前提供高效预热，利用注意力行为指导嵌入初始化和适配。

Result: 在多样化语言设置下的实验表明，MATT在几个GPU小时内恢复了原始模型性能的很大一部分，优于启发式基线方法。

Conclusion: 整合模型级信号为多语言LLM中的鲁棒tokenizer迁移提供了实用有效的路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained to support an increasing number of
languages, yet their predefined tokenizers remain a bottleneck for adapting
models to lower-resource or distinct-script languages. Existing tokenizer
transfer methods typically rely on semantic heuristics to initialize new
embeddings, ignoring higher-layer model dynamics and limiting transfer quality.
We propose Model-Aware Tokenizer Transfer (MATT), a method that incorporates
model internals into the tokenizer transfer process. MATT introduces an
Attention Influence Modeling (AIM) objective that distills inter-token
communication patterns from a source model into a target model with a new
tokenizer, providing an efficient warm-up before standard language modeling.
Unlike approaches that focus solely on embedding similarity, MATT leverages
attention behavior to guide embedding initialization and adaptation.
Experiments across diverse linguistic settings show that MATT recovers a large
fraction of the original model's performance within a few GPU hours,
outperforming heuristic baselines. These results demonstrate that incorporating
model-level signals offers a practical and effective path toward robust
tokenizer transfer in multilingual LLMs.

Result: 实验表明，针对特定作者训练的GPT-2模型能够更准确地预测该作者的保留文本，成功区分了八位不同作者的写作风格，并确认了R. P. Thompson对《绿野仙踪》第15本书的作者身份。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型能够有效捕捉作者的独特写作风格，为作者身份识别和验证提供了新的技术手段。

Abstract: We show that large language models (LLMs) can be used to distinguish the
writings of different authors. Specifically, an individual GPT-2 model, trained
from scratch on the works of one author, will predict held-out text from that
author more accurately than held-out text from other authors. We suggest that,
in this way, a model trained on one author's works embodies the unique writing
style of that author. We first demonstrate our approach on books written by
eight different (known) authors. We also use this approach to confirm R. P.
Thompson's authorship of the well-studied 15th book of the Oz series,
originally attributed to F. L. Baum.

Result: 实证评估表明，具有说服意识的提示能显著绕过LLM的安全防护措施，成功诱导越狱行为。同时发现LLM在越狱响应中展现出独特的说服特征。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了跨学科洞察在应对LLM安全挑战中的重要性，表明说服理论可以成为理解和防御越狱攻击的有效工具。

Abstract: Despite recent advances, Large Language Models remain vulnerable to jailbreak
attacks that bypass alignment safeguards and elicit harmful outputs. While
prior research has proposed various attack strategies differing in human
readability and transferability, little attention has been paid to the
linguistic and psychological mechanisms that may influence a model's
susceptibility to such attacks. In this paper, we examine an interdisciplinary
line of research that leverages foundational theories of persuasion from the
social sciences to craft adversarial prompts capable of circumventing alignment
constraints in LLMs. Drawing on well-established persuasive strategies, we
hypothesize that LLMs, having been trained on large-scale human-generated text,
may respond more compliantly to prompts with persuasive structures.
Furthermore, we investigate whether LLMs themselves exhibit distinct persuasive
fingerprints that emerge in their jailbreak responses. Empirical evaluations
across multiple aligned LLMs reveal that persuasion-aware prompts significantly
bypass safeguards, demonstrating their potential to induce jailbreak behaviors.
This work underscores the importance of cross-disciplinary insight in
addressing the evolving challenges of LLM safety. The code and data are
available.

Motivation: 尽管离散优化越狱攻击的后缀可转移性已被经验证实，但缺乏对其发生时机和原因的严格分析。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过大量实验设置，识别与转移成功强相关的三个统计属性，并与提示语义相似性进行对比分析。

Result: 发现三个统计属性（拒绝方向激活度、后缀诱导远离强度、正交方向偏移）与转移成功强相关，而提示语义相似性仅弱相关。

Conclusion: 这些发现提供了对可转移性的更精细理解，并通过干预实验展示了统计分析如何转化为攻击成功的实际改进。

Abstract: Discrete optimization-based jailbreaking attacks on large language models aim
to generate short, nonsensical suffixes that, when appended onto input prompts,
elicit disallowed content. Notably, these suffixes are often transferable --
succeeding on prompts and models for which they were never optimized. And yet,
despite the fact that transferability is surprising and empirically
well-established, the field lacks a rigorous analysis of when and why transfer
occurs. To fill this gap, we identify three statistical properties that
strongly correlate with transfer success across numerous experimental settings:
(1) how much a prompt without a suffix activates a model's internal refusal
direction, (2) how strongly a suffix induces a push away from this direction,
and (3) how large these shifts are in directions orthogonal to refusal. On the
other hand, we find that prompt semantic similarity only weakly correlates with
transfer success. These findings lead to a more fine-grained understanding of
transferability, which we use in interventional experiments to showcase how our
statistical analysis can translate into practical improvements in attack
success.

Motivation: 质量评估指标在机器翻译的无参考评估和强化学习等任务中至关重要，但长度偏见的存在和影响尚未得到充分探索，可能对长翻译造成不公平惩罚并导致次优决策。

Method: 对10种不同语言对的顶级回归基和LLM-as-a-Judge QE指标进行系统研究，识别两种关键长度偏见，并提出长度归一化训练和评估时引入参考文本两种缓解方法。

Result: 发现QE指标存在两种系统性的长度偏见：对长翻译过度预测错误，以及在多候选翻译中偏好短翻译。提出的两种策略都能有效减轻这种偏见。

Conclusion: QE指标存在显著的长度偏见问题，需要通过长度归一化和参考文本引入等策略来缓解，以确保公平评估和优化应用决策。

Abstract: Quality Estimation (QE) metrics are vital in machine translation for
reference-free evaluation and as a reward signal in tasks like reinforcement
learning. However, the prevalence and impact of length bias in QE have been
underexplored. Through a systematic study of top-performing regression-based
and LLM-as-a-Judge QE metrics across 10 diverse language pairs, we reveal two
critical length biases: First, QE metrics consistently over-predict errors with
increasing translation length, even for high-quality, error-free texts. Second,
they exhibit a preference for shorter translations when multiple candidates are
available for the same source text. These inherent length biases risk unfairly
penalizing longer, correct translations and can lead to sub-optimal
decision-making in applications such as QE reranking and QE guided
reinforcement learning. To mitigate this, we propose two strategies: (a)
applying length normalization during model training, and (b) incorporating
reference texts during evaluation. Both approaches were found to effectively
reduce the identified length bias.

Abstract: Scaling laws research has focused overwhelmingly on English -- yet the most
prominent AI models explicitly serve billions of international users. In this
work, we undertake the largest multilingual scaling laws study to date,
totaling 774 multilingual training experiments, spanning 10M-8B model
parameters, 400+ training languages and 48 evaluation languages. We introduce
the Adaptive Transfer Scaling Law (ATLAS) for both monolingual and multilingual
pretraining, which outperforms existing scaling laws' out-of-sample
generalization often by more than 0.3 R^2. Our analyses of the experiments shed
light on multilingual learning dynamics, transfer properties between languages,
and the curse of multilinguality. First, we derive a cross-lingual transfer
matrix, empirically measuring mutual benefit scores between 38 x 38=1444
language pairs. Second, we derive a language-agnostic scaling law that reveals
how to optimally scale model size and data when adding languages without
sacrificing performance. Third, we identify the computational crossover points
for when to pretrain from scratch versus finetune from multilingual
checkpoints. We hope these findings provide the scientific foundation for
democratizing scaling laws across languages, and enable practitioners to
efficiently scale models -- beyond English-first AI.

Conclusion: LLMs中存在一致且可操纵的情感几何结构，这为理解模型如何内化和处理情感提供了重要见解。

Abstract: This work investigates how large language models (LLMs) internally represent
emotion by analyzing the geometry of their hidden-state space. The paper
identifies a low-dimensional emotional manifold and shows that emotional
representations are directionally encoded, distributed across layers, and
aligned with interpretable dimensions. These structures are stable across depth
and generalize to eight real-world emotion datasets spanning five languages.
Cross-domain alignment yields low error and strong linear probe performance,
indicating a universal emotional subspace. Within this space, internal emotion
perception can be steered while preserving semantics using a learned
intervention module, with especially strong control for basic emotions across
languages. These findings reveal a consistent and manipulable affective
geometry in LLMs and offer insight into how they internalize and process
emotion.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) still produce gender-stereotyped language even
in occupation-neutral contexts that reflect deep societal biases (Rudinger et
al., 2018). To address this, prior work has proposed prompting, constrained
decoding (Dathathri et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2024), post-processing, and
fine-tuning-based alignment (Rafailov et al., 2023; Ravfogel et al., 2022).
However, the comparative efficacy and learning dynamics remain little
understood. We report a comparative analysis of six control techniques for bias
mitigation: prompt-only, generate-and-filter, DFA-based Ctrl-G decoding,
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and
Iterative Nullspace Projection (INLP). We evaluate each method on a
compositional constraint task. This task requires generating sentences that
contain at least one agentic and one communal descriptor for each of the twenty
Winogender-derived occupations. We quantify trade-offs between control strength
and naturalness with evaluations of constraint compliance, lexical diversity,
and fluency. Our results reveal key contrasts among the methods: SFT achieves
99.87 +- 0.15% compliance and high lexical diversity, while DPO, despite
similar training stability, fails at 4.53 +- 0.82%. Ctrl-G guarantees perfect
compliance, but at the cost of severely reduced fluency and diversity.
Preference-based learning fundamentally differs: it cannot satisfy
compositional constraints, as binary preference signals encode ranking, not
logical conjunctions. Only explicit positive supervision enables mitigation of
compositional biases; preference-based alignment fails to generalize logical
structures, underscoring the limitations of preference learning and the
necessity of explicit supervision for fair and fluent controlled generation.

### [228] [Generalization or Memorization: Dynamic Decoding for Mode Steering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22099)
*Xuanming Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一框架来理解和控制LLMs的泛化与记忆模式，基于信息瓶颈理论开发了动态模式引导算法，通过线性探测和激活引导来提升模型的逻辑一致性和事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs存在泛化能力和死记硬背记忆的双重特性，这种不可预测性在高风险应用中削弱了其可靠性，需要系统性地理解和控制这两种推理模式。

Method: 基于信息瓶颈理论建立理论模型，开发动态模式引导算法，包含轻量级因果线性探测和动态激活引导机制，采用自适应自对比解码框架。

Result: 在推理和忠实性任务上的实验表明，动态模式引导显著改善了逻辑一致性和事实准确性。

Conclusion: 该工作为增强LLM可靠性提供了一种原则性方法，能够有效引导模型从记忆模式转向泛化模式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit a troubling duality, capable of both
remarkable generalization and brittle, verbatim memorization of their training
data. This unpredictability undermines their reliability in high-stakes
applications. In this work, we propose a unified framework to understand,
identify, and control these distinct reasoning modes. First, we introduce a
theoretical model based on the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle,
formalizing generalization as the learning of a compressed, task-relevant
representation and memorization as a failure to compress. Building on this
theory, we develop Dynamic Mode Steering (DMS), a novel inference-time
algorithm which comprises two components: (1) a lightweight, causally-grounded
linear probe that identifies the model's instantaneous reliance on
memorization, and (2) a dynamic activation steering mechanism that nudges the
model's computation towards pre-identified generalization circuits. We frame
DMS as a form of adaptive, self-contrastive decoding. Experiments on reasoning
and faithfulness tasks demonstrate that DMS significantly improves logical
consistency and factual accuracy, thereby offering a principled approach to
enhancing LLM reliability.

### [229] [Gradual Forgetting: Logarithmic Compression for Extending Transformer Context Windows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22109)
*Billy Dickson,Zoran Tiganj*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过输入级别的对数压缩来扩展transformer长程记忆的方法，而不是修改transformer架构本身。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有处理长上下文的方法通常通过增加复杂度（如循环机制或辅助记忆模块）来修改transformer内部架构，本文寻求一种更简单的方法。

Method: 受人类记忆认知模型启发，对输入token应用尺度不变的对数压缩，生成压缩表示后由标准未修改的transformer处理。

Result: 在WikiText-103和PG-19语言建模基准测试中，相比未压缩基线降低了困惑度，且随着压缩时间上下文变长性能持续提升。

Conclusion: 输入级别的对数压缩是扩展transformer长程记忆的简单有效方法，同时保持了架构的简洁性。

Abstract: Most approaches to long-context processing increase the complexity of the
transformer's internal architecture by integrating mechanisms such as
recurrence or auxiliary memory modules. In this work, we introduce an
alternative approach that modifies the input representation itself, rather than
the transformer architecture. Inspired by cognitive models of human memory, our
method applies a scale-invariant logarithmic compression to the input tokens.
The resulting compressed representation is processed by a standard, unmodified
transformer, preserving architectural simplicity. We evaluate this approach on
the WikiText-103 and PG-19 language modeling benchmarks, showing a reduction in
perplexity compared to uncompressed baselines. Moreover, performance improves
consistently with longer compressed temporal contexts, showing that input-level
logarithmic compression is a simple and effective way to extend a transformer's
long-range memory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建一个能够从数百亿扩展到万亿参数规模的统一推理导向语言基础模型，强调高稀疏性、跨尺度一致性和基于经验缩放定律的效率。

Method: 采用高稀疏MoE架构，结合MTP高效推理机制、推理导向数据和训练中思维链激活、基于强化的微调(DFT、Evo-CoT)，以及全尺度FP8训练和细粒度异构流水线。

Result: 在万亿规模上，Ling-1T建立了推理准确性与计算效率的新帕累托前沿，稀疏激活与推理目标正确对齐时能够实现可扩展且高效的智能。

Conclusion: Ling 2.0为推进未来推理和思维模型提供了一个连贯、开放且高效的基础，包括基于相同基础的Ring系列。

Abstract: We introduce Ling 2.0, a series reasoning-oriented language foundation built
upon the principle that every activation boosts reasoning capability. Designed
to scale from tens of billions to one trillion parameters under a unified
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm, Ling 2.0 emphasizes high sparsity,
cross-scale consistency, and efficiency guided by empirical scaling laws. The
series includes three non-thinking (instruct) models - Ling-mini-2.0,
Ling-flash-2.0, and Ling-1T - ranging from 16B to 1T total parameters and
achieving up to 7-fold active-compute efficiency compared with dense
counterparts. Ling 2.0 integrates coordinated innovations across model
architecture, pre-training, post-training, and infrastructure: a high-sparsity
MoE with MTP for efficient reasoning, reasoning-oriented data and mid-training
CoT activation, reinforcement-based fine-tuning (DFT, Evo-CoT), and full-scale
FP8 training with fine-grained heterogeneous pipelines. At the trillion scale,
Ling-1T establishes a new Pareto frontier of reasoning accuracy versus
computational efficiency, demonstrating that sparse activation, when properly
aligned with reasoning objectives, enables scalable and efficient intelligence.
Collectively, Ling 2.0 provides a coherent, open, and efficient foundation for
advancing future reasoning and thinking models, including the Ring series built
upon the same base.

TL;DR: 提出了OlaMind框架，通过Learn-to-Think和Learn-to-Respond两阶段方法，显著提升智能客服系统的人类相似度和自然性，同时有效减少幻觉和业务风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于RAG的智能客服系统存在幻觉问题和机械响应，可能带来业务风险并影响用户体验，特别是在Web客服交互场景下。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：Learn-to-Think阶段学习人类专家的推理过程和响应策略；Learn-to-Respond阶段结合冷启动监督微调和强化学习进行基础到困难的自优化。

Result: 在工业级社交客服环境中进行大规模在线A/B测试，在社区支持/直播互动场景中分别实现智能解决率+28.92%/+18.42%和人工接管率-6.08%/-7.12%的显著提升。

Conclusion: OlaMind框架在不同现实应用中展现出一致的有效性，显著提高了智能客服系统的人类相似度和安全性。

Abstract: Intelligent customer service (ICS) systems via retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) have been widely adopted in Web-based domains such as social platforms
and e-commerce, achieving remarkable improvements in automation and efficiency.
However, notable limitations still remain: these systems are prone to
hallucinations and often generate rigid, mechanical responses, which can
introduce business risks and undermine user experience, especially in Web-based
customer service interactions under the RAG scenarios. In this paper, we
introduce OlaMind, a human-like and hallucination-safe customer service
framework for retrieval-augmented dialogue. Specifically, it first leverages a
Learn-to-Think stage to learn the reasoning processes and response strategies
from human experts, and then employs a Learn-to-Respond stage to perform
cold-start supervised fine-tuning (SFT) combined with reinforcement learning
(RL) for basic-to-hard self-refinement. Our method significantly enhances
human-likeness and naturalness while effectively mitigating hallucinations and
critical business risks. We have conducted large-scale online A/B experiments
in an industry-level social customer service setting, and extensive
experimental results show that OlaMind achieves significant cumulative relative
improvements with intelligent resolution rates +28.92%/+18.42% and human
takeover rate -6.08%/-7.12% in community-support/livestream-interaction
scenarios, respectively, which highlights its consistent effectiveness across
diverse real-world applications. The code and data will be publicly available.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了首个迈蒂利语可解释情感分析数据集，包含3,221个带情感极性和自然语言解释的句子，填补了低资源语言在可解释AI领域的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言迈蒂利语在自然语言处理中的代表性不足问题，特别是缺乏细粒度标注和可解释机制的情感分析资源。

Method: 构建包含3,221个迈蒂利语句子的数据集，每个句子都标注了情感极性和自然语言解释，并由语言专家进行验证以确保标签可靠性和上下文保真度。

Result: 通过经典机器学习和最先进的transformer架构进行广泛实验，证明了该数据集在可解释情感分析方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 这项工作为迈蒂利语建立了首个可解释情感计算基准，为多语言NLP和可解释AI的广泛发展贡献了宝贵资源。

Abstract: Developing benchmark datasets for low-resource languages poses significant
challenges, primarily due to the limited availability of native linguistic
experts and the substantial time and cost involved in annotation. Given these
challenges, Maithili is still underrepresented in natural language processing
research. It is an Indo-Aryan language spoken by more than 13 million people in
the Purvanchal region of India, valued for its rich linguistic structure and
cultural significance. While sentiment analysis has achieved remarkable
progress in high-resource languages, resources for low-resource languages, such
as Maithili, remain scarce, often restricted to coarse-grained annotations and
lacking interpretability mechanisms. To address this limitation, we introduce a
novel dataset comprising 3,221 Maithili sentences annotated for sentiment
polarity and accompanied by natural language justifications. Moreover, the
dataset is carefully curated and validated by linguistic experts to ensure both
label reliability and contextual fidelity. Notably, the justifications are
written in Maithili, thereby promoting culturally grounded interpretation and
enhancing the explainability of sentiment models. Furthermore, extensive
experiments using both classical machine learning and state-of-the-art
transformer architectures demonstrate the dataset's effectiveness for
interpretable sentiment analysis. Ultimately, this work establishes the first
benchmark for explainable affective computing in Maithili, thus contributing a
valuable resource to the broader advancement of multilingual NLP and
explainable AI.

*Maria Korobeynikova,Alessia Battisti,Lukas Fischer,Yingqiang Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了DETECT，首个德语专用的文本简化评估指标，通过LLM生成合成质量分数训练，在简洁性、意义保留和流畅性三个维度上全面评估德语ATS质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前德语自动文本简化评估依赖通用指标如SARI、BLEU和BERTScore，这些指标无法充分捕捉简化质量。虽然英语有专门指标如LENS，但德语缺乏相应工具且缺少人工标注语料。

Method: 将LENS框架适配到德语，并扩展了：(i) 通过LLM生成合成质量分数的流程，无需人工标注即可创建数据集；(ii) 基于LLM的细化步骤，使评分标准与简化要求对齐。还构建了最大的德语人工评估数据集进行验证。

Result: 实验结果显示，DETECT与人类判断的相关性显著高于广泛使用的ATS指标，在意义保留和流畅性方面提升尤其明显。

Conclusion: DETECT填补了德语ATS评估的空白，同时揭示了LLM在自动评估中的潜力和局限性，为通用语言可访问性任务提供了可转移的指导原则。

Abstract: Current evaluation of German automatic text simplification (ATS) relies on
general-purpose metrics such as SARI, BLEU, and BERTScore, which insufficiently
capture simplification quality in terms of simplicity, meaning preservation,
and fluency. While specialized metrics like LENS have been developed for
English, corresponding efforts for German have lagged behind due to the absence
of human-annotated corpora. To close this gap, we introduce DETECT, the first
German-specific metric that holistically evaluates ATS quality across all three
dimensions of simplicity, meaning preservation, and fluency, and is trained
entirely on synthetic large language model (LLM) responses. Our approach adapts
the LENS framework to German and extends it with (i) a pipeline for generating
synthetic quality scores via LLMs, enabling dataset creation without human
annotation, and (ii) an LLM-based refinement step for aligning grading criteria
with simplification requirements. To the best of our knowledge, we also
construct the largest German human evaluation dataset for text simplification
to validate our metric directly. Experimental results show that DETECT achieves
substantially higher correlations with human judgments than widely used ATS
metrics, with particularly strong gains in meaning preservation and fluency.
Beyond ATS, our findings highlight both the potential and the limitations of
LLMs for automatic evaluation and provide transferable guidelines for general
language accessibility tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种测量LLM在成对文本比较中输出错误的方法，无需依赖真实标签，支持均匀错误率和二元位置偏差两种场景，通过Copeland计数构建文本排名来估计错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测量LLM在成对文本比较任务中的错误概率，特别是位置偏差对比较结果的影响，为评估LLM比较性能提供可靠方法。

Method: 使用两种比较场景：(i)均匀错误率，通过每个文本对进行两次比较（交换顺序）估计；(ii)二元位置偏差，假设两种比较顺序有不同错误率，通过重复比较估计。采用Copeland计数从成对偏好构建文本排名。

Result: 在六个LLM（ChatGPT、Claude、DeepSeek、Gemini、Grok、Qwen）和五种文本输入类型上获得一致的错误率估计。两个位置偏差项相似，接近均匀错误。Claude在错误率和提示鲁棒性方面表现最佳。

Conclusion: 该方法在指示LLM成对比较错误方面优于有偏Bradley-Terry模型和交换性评分，为评估LLM比较性能提供了有效工具。

Abstract: We measure LLMs' output error at pairwise text comparison, noting the
probability of error in their preferences. Our method does not rely on the
ground truth and supports two scenarios: (i) uniform error rate regardless of
the order of comparison, estimated with two comparisons for each text pair with
either text placed first; (ii) binary positional bias assuming distinct error
rates for the two orders of comparison, estimated with repeated comparisons
between the texts. The Copeland counting constructs a ranking over the compared
texts from pairwise preferences; the ranking reveals the poor scalability of
LLM-based pairwise comparison and helps yield the estimates for LLMs' error
rates. We apply the method to six LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini,
Grok, Qwen) with five types of text input and obtain consistent estimates of
LLMs' error. In general, the measured two positional bias terms are similar,
close to the uniform error. Considering both the error rates and the robustness
to the variation of prompts, Claude obtained the most desirable performance in
this experiment. Our model outperforms the biased Bradley-Terry model and the
commutativity score in indicating LLMs' error at this task.

TL;DR: 本文分析了Swadesh方法在语言年代学中的局限性，指出即使满足所有基本假设，数学上仍存在估计精度的限制，并提出了考虑词汇渐进修改过程可以提高时间分离估计的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Swadesh方法在语言年代学中广泛使用，但其基本假设往往不现实，且即使假设满足，数学上仍存在估计精度的固有局限。本文旨在分析这些概率性限制，并探讨词汇渐进修改过程对提高估计精度的重要性。

Method: 通过概率分析研究Swadesh方法的数学局限性，并引入词汇渐进修改这一随机过程，从纯概率角度证明考虑这一过程可以显著提高时间分离估计的精度。

Result: 研究发现Swadesh方法存在固有的概率性精度限制，这些限制在词汇统计学研究中常被忽视。同时，词汇渐进修改过程对语言词汇演变有重要贡献，考虑这一过程可以显著提高时间分离估计的准确性。

Conclusion: Swadesh方法在语言年代学中的应用存在数学上的固有精度限制，而考虑词汇渐进修改这一随机过程可以显著改进时间分离的估计精度，这对语言年代学研究具有重要意义。

Abstract: The Swadesh approach for determining the temporal separation between two
languages relies on the stochastic process of words replacement (when a
complete new word emerges to represent a given concept). It is well known that
the basic assumptions of the Swadesh approach are often unrealistic due to
various contamination phenomena and misjudgments (horizontal transfers,
variations over time and space of the replacement rate, incorrect assessments
of cognacy relationships, presence of synonyms, and so on). All of this means
that the results cannot be completely correct.
  More importantly, even in the unrealistic case that all basic assumptions are
satisfied, simple mathematics places limits on the accuracy of estimating the
temporal separation between two languages. These limits, which are purely
probabilistic in nature and which are often neglected in lexicostatistical
studies, are analyzed in detail in this article.
  Furthermore, in this work we highlight that the evolution of a language's
lexicon is also driven by another stochastic process: gradual lexical
modification of words. We show that this process equally also represents a
major contribution to the reshaping of the vocabulary of languages over the
centuries and we also show, from a purely probabilistic perspective, that
taking into account this second random process significantly increases the
precision in determining the temporal separation between two languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进标准CoT提示方法，解决语义模糊和常识错误问题，提升LLM的推理能力。

Method: 提出"Sculpting"方法，这是一种基于规则的约束提示方法。在GSM8K数学推理基准（1,317个问题）上评估了三种提示策略（零样本、标准CoT和Sculpting）在三个OpenAI模型（gpt-4o-mini、gpt-4o、gpt-5）上的表现。

Result: 发现"提示反转"现象：Sculpting在gpt-4o上表现更好（97% vs 93%），但在gpt-5上反而有害（94.00% vs 96.36%）。这是由于"护栏到手铐"的转变——约束在中等模型中防止常识错误，但在先进模型中引发过度字面化。

Conclusion: 最佳提示策略必须与模型能力共同进化，对于更强大的模型，更简单的提示可能更有效。

Abstract: Prompt engineering, particularly Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting,
significantly enhances LLM reasoning capabilities. We introduce "Sculpting," a
constrained, rule-based prompting method designed to improve upon standard CoT
by reducing errors from semantic ambiguity and flawed common sense.
  We evaluate three prompting strategies (Zero Shot, standard CoT, and
Sculpting) across three OpenAI model generations (gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4o, gpt-5)
using the GSM8K mathematical reasoning benchmark (1,317 problems).
  Our findings reveal a "Prompting Inversion": Sculpting provides advantages on
gpt-4o (97% vs. 93% for standard CoT), but becomes detrimental on gpt-5 (94.00%
vs. 96.36% for CoT on full benchmark). We trace this to a
"Guardrail-to-Handcuff" transition where constraints preventing common-sense
errors in mid-tier models induce hyper-literalism in advanced models. Our
detailed error analysis demonstrates that optimal prompting strategies must
co-evolve with model capabilities, suggesting simpler prompts for more capable
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有激活引导方法使用所有历史数据计算引导向量，但并非所有内容都反映真实用户偏好，这会削弱个性化信号

Method: 基于因果推断理论估计token级因果效应来识别偏好驱动token，将这些离散信号转化为连贯描述，然后用于引导个性化LLM生成

Result: 在两个代表性引导骨干方法和真实数据集上的实验表明，SteerX持续提升引导向量质量

Conclusion: SteerX通过关注真正偏好驱动的信息，为更有效的LLM个性化提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success in recent years,
enabling a wide range of applications, including intelligent assistants that
support users' daily life and work. A critical factor in building such
assistants is personalizing LLMs, as user preferences and needs vary widely.
Activation steering, which directly leverages directions representing user
preference in the LLM activation space to adjust its behavior, offers a
cost-effective way to align the model's outputs with individual users. However,
existing methods rely on all historical data to compute the steering vector,
ignoring that not all content reflects true user preferences, which undermines
the personalization signal. To address this, we propose SteerX, a disentangled
steering method that isolates preference-driven components from
preference-agnostic components. Grounded in causal inference theory, SteerX
estimates token-level causal effects to identify preference-driven tokens,
transforms these discrete signals into a coherent description, and then
leverages them to steer personalized LLM generation. By focusing on the truly
preference-driven information, SteerX produces more accurate activation
steering vectors and enhances personalization. Experiments on two
representative steering backbone methods across real-world datasets demonstrate
that SteerX consistently enhances steering vector quality, offering a practical
solution for more effective LLM personalization.

Abstract: Patent text embeddings enable prior art search, technology landscaping, and
patent analysis, yet existing benchmarks inadequately capture patent-specific
challenges. We introduce PatenTEB, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 15
tasks across retrieval, classification, paraphrase, and clustering, with 2.06
million examples. PatenTEB employs domain-stratified splits, domain specific
hard negative mining, and systematic coverage of asymmetric
fragment-to-document matching scenarios absent from general embedding
benchmarks. We develop the patembed model family through multi-task training,
spanning 67M to 344M parameters with context lengths up to 4096 tokens.
External validation shows strong generalization: patembed-base achieves
state-of-the-art on MTEB BigPatentClustering.v2 (0.494 V-measure vs. 0.445
previous best), while patembed-large achieves 0.377 NDCG@100 on DAPFAM.
Systematic ablations reveal that multi-task training improves external

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent years. One
application of LLMs is to support student learning in educational settings.
However, prior work has shown that LLMs still struggle to answer questions
accurately within university-level computer science courses. In this work, we
investigate how incorporating university course materials can enhance LLM
performance in this setting. A key challenge lies in leveraging diverse course
materials such as lecture slides and transcripts, which differ substantially
from typical textual corpora: slides also contain visual elements like images
and formulas, while transcripts contain spoken, less structured language. We
compare two strategies, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Continual
Pre-Training (CPT), to extend LLMs with course-specific knowledge. For lecture
slides, we further explore a multi-modal RAG approach, where we present the
retrieved content to the generator in image form. Our experiments reveal that,
given the relatively small size of university course materials, RAG is more
effective and efficient than CPT. Moreover, incorporating slides as images in
the multi-modal setting significantly improves performance over text-only
retrieval. These findings highlight practical strategies for developing AI
assistants that better support learning and teaching, and we hope they inspire
similar efforts in other educational contexts.

Method: 使用CADEC语料库，评估三类方法：(i) BERT风格编码器(BERT Base、BioClinicalBERT、RoBERTa-large)；(ii) GPT-4o少样本上下文学习(简单vs复杂提示)；(iii) GPT-4o监督微调。

Result: RoBERTa-large和BioClinicalBERT相比BERT Base改进有限；简单上下文学习优于复杂提示；监督微调获得最佳性能(F1≈87.1%)但成本更高；LLM在简化任务(二分类)上表现更好。

Conclusion: 监督微调在临床NER任务中表现最佳，但上下文学习在简化任务中也有竞争力，表明不同方法各有适用场景。

Abstract: We study clinical Named Entity Recognition (NER) on the CADEC corpus and
compare three families of approaches: (i) BERT-style encoders (BERT Base,
BioClinicalBERT, RoBERTa-large), (ii) GPT-4o used with few-shot in-context
learning (ICL) under simple vs.\ complex prompts, and (iii) GPT-4o with
supervised fine-tuning (SFT). All models are evaluated on standard NER metrics
over CADEC's five entity types (ADR, Drug, Disease, Symptom, Finding).
RoBERTa-large and BioClinicalBERT offer limited improvements over BERT Base,
showing the limit of these family of models. Among LLM settings, simple ICL
outperforms a longer, instruction-heavy prompt, and SFT achieves the strongest
overall performance (F1 $\approx$ 87.1%), albeit with higher cost. We find that
the LLM achieve higher accuracy on simplified tasks, restricting classification
to two labels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 寻求比深度神经网络语言建模更高效、更环保的替代方案，减少训练和推理过程中的生态足迹

Method: 使用k近邻分类的快速近似实现基于记忆的语言建模，完全依赖CPU运行，实现低延迟

Result: OLIFANT在下一个词预测准确率、排放估计和速度方面与GPT-2和GPT-Neo进行了比较，表现出良好性能

Abstract: We present memory-based language modeling as an efficient, eco-friendly
alternative to deep neural network-based language modeling. It offers
log-linearly scalable next-token prediction performance and strong memorization
capabilities. Implementing fast approximations of k-nearest neighbor
classification, memory-based language modeling leaves a relatively small
ecological footprint both in training and in inference mode, as it relies fully
on CPUs and attains low token latencies. Its internal workings are simple and
fully transparent. We compare our implementation of memory-based language
modeling, OLIFANT, with GPT-2 and GPT-Neo on next-token prediction accuracy,
estimated emissions and speeds, and offer some deeper analyses of the model.

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个多语言目标立场提取基准，涵盖6种语言，展示了在无需为每种语言单独建模的情况下扩展TSE管道的可行性，但F1分数仅为12.78，突显了多语言任务的挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体数据可用于分析争议性议题的公众意见，但现有的目标立场提取研究仅限于英语，缺乏多语言基准。

Method: 将原始TSE管道扩展到多语言设置，不需要为每种语言单独训练模型，构建了涵盖加泰罗尼亚语、爱沙尼亚语、法语、意大利语、普通话和西班牙语的语料库。

Result: 模型管道获得了12.78的F1分数，表明多语言任务相比英语设置难度显著增加，目标预测是主要瓶颈。

Conclusion: 这项工作为多语言TSE提供了急需的基准，包括资源、算法和评估标准，并首次展示了TSE的F1分数对不同目标表述的敏感性。

Abstract: Social media enables data-driven analysis of public opinion on contested
issues. Target-Stance Extraction (TSE) is the task of identifying the target
discussed in a document and the document's stance towards that target. Many
works classify stance towards a given target in a multilingual setting, but all
prior work in TSE is English-only. This work introduces the first multilingual
TSE benchmark, spanning Catalan, Estonian, French, Italian, Mandarin, and
Spanish corpora. It manages to extend the original TSE pipeline to a
multilingual setting without requiring separate models for each language. Our
model pipeline achieves a modest F1 score of 12.78, underscoring the increased
difficulty of the multilingual task relative to English-only setups and
highlighting target prediction as the primary bottleneck. We are also the first
to demonstrate the sensitivity of TSE's F1 score to different target
verbalizations. Together these serve as a much-needed baseline for resources,
algorithms, and evaluation criteria in multilingual TSE.

*Mohammad Aghajani Asl,Majid Asgari-Bidhendi,Behrooz Minaei-Bidgoli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FAIR-RAG是一个新型的代理框架，通过结构化证据评估和迭代优化循环，解决了传统RAG系统在处理复杂多跳查询时的证据缺口问题，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG框架在处理需要从不同来源综合信息的复杂多跳查询时表现不佳，缺乏系统识别和填补证据缺口的机制，容易传播噪声或无法收集全面上下文。

Method: 提出FAIR-RAG框架，核心是结构化证据评估(SEA)模块控制的迭代优化循环。SEA将初始查询分解为所需发现清单，审核聚合证据以识别确认事实和明确信息缺口，这些缺口信号驱动自适应查询优化代理生成新的针对性子查询来检索缺失信息。

Result: 在HotpotQA、2WikiMultiHopQA和MusiQue等挑战性多跳QA基准测试中，FAIR-RAG显著优于强基线。在HotpotQA上F1得分为0.453，比最强迭代基线绝对提升8.3分，在这些基准上建立了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 具有明确缺口分析的结构化、证据驱动的优化过程对于在复杂知识密集型任务中解锁高级RAG系统的可靠准确推理至关重要。

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates hallucination and
knowledge staleness in Large Language Models (LLMs), existing frameworks often
falter on complex, multi-hop queries that require synthesizing information from
disparate sources. Current advanced RAG methods, employing iterative or
adaptive strategies, lack a robust mechanism to systematically identify and
fill evidence gaps, often propagating noise or failing to gather a
comprehensive context. We introduce FAIR-RAG, a novel agentic framework that
transforms the standard RAG pipeline into a dynamic, evidence-driven reasoning
process. At its core is an Iterative Refinement Cycle governed by a module we
term Structured Evidence Assessment (SEA). The SEA acts as an analytical gating
mechanism: it deconstructs the initial query into a checklist of required
findings and audits the aggregated evidence to identify confirmed facts and,
critically, explicit informational gaps. These gaps provide a precise signal to
an Adaptive Query Refinement agent, which generates new, targeted sub-queries
to retrieve missing information. This cycle repeats until the evidence is
verified as sufficient, ensuring a comprehensive context for a final, strictly
faithful generation. We conducted experiments on challenging multi-hop QA
benchmarks, including HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, and MusiQue. In a unified
experimental setup, FAIR-RAG significantly outperforms strong baselines. On
HotpotQA, it achieves an F1-score of 0.453 -- an absolute improvement of 8.3
points over the strongest iterative baseline -- establishing a new
state-of-the-art for this class of methods on these benchmarks. Our work
demonstrates that a structured, evidence-driven refinement process with
explicit gap analysis is crucial for unlocking reliable and accurate reasoning
in advanced RAG systems for complex, knowledge-intensive tasks.

Abstract: Ironic identification is a challenging task in Natural Language Processing,
particularly when dealing with languages that differ in syntax and cultural
context. In this work, we aim to detect irony in Urdu by translating an English
Ironic Corpus into the Urdu language. We evaluate ten state-of-the-art machine

(8B) achieved the highest performance with an F1-score of 94.61%. These results
demonstrate that combining transliteration techniques with modern NLP models
enables robust irony detection in Urdu, a historically low-resource language.

TL;DR: 提出了VisJudge-Bench，首个用于评估多模态大语言模型在可视化美学和质量评估能力的基准，包含3,090个专家标注样本。研究发现现有MLLMs与人类专家存在显著差距，为此开发了VisJudge模型，显著缩小了与人类判断的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可视化质量评估具有挑战性，需要同时考虑数据编码准确性、信息表达性和视觉美学。虽然MLLMs在自然图像美学评估中表现良好，但缺乏系统性的基准来评估其在可视化领域的表现。

Method: 构建VisJudge-Bench基准，包含3,090个专家标注的真实场景样本，涵盖32种图表类型。提出VisJudge模型专门用于可视化美学和质量评估。

Result: 测试发现最先进的MLLMs（如GPT-5）与人类专家存在显著差距（MAE=0.551，相关性仅0.429）。VisJudge模型将MAE降低至0.442（减少19.8%），与人类专家一致性提升至0.681（提高58.7%）。

Conclusion: VisJudge-Bench填补了可视化质量评估基准的空白，VisJudge模型在可视化美学和质量评估方面显著优于通用MLLMs，为这一领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Visualization, a domain-specific yet widely used form of imagery, is an
effective way to turn complex datasets into intuitive insights, and its value
depends on whether data are faithfully represented, clearly communicated, and
aesthetically designed. However, evaluating visualization quality is
challenging: unlike natural images, it requires simultaneous judgment across
data encoding accuracy, information expressiveness, and visual aesthetics.
Although multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promising
performance in aesthetic assessment of natural images, no systematic benchmark
exists for measuring their capabilities in evaluating visualizations. To
address this, we propose VisJudge-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark for
evaluating MLLMs' performance in assessing visualization aesthetics and
quality. It contains 3,090 expert-annotated samples from real-world scenarios,
covering single visualizations, multiple visualizations, and dashboards across
32 chart types. Systematic testing on this benchmark reveals that even the most
advanced MLLMs (such as GPT-5) still exhibit significant gaps compared to human
experts in judgment, with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.551 and a
correlation with human ratings of only 0.429. To address this issue, we propose
VisJudge, a model specifically designed for visualization aesthetics and
quality assessment. Experimental results demonstrate that VisJudge
significantly narrows the gap with human judgment, reducing the MAE to 0.442 (a
19.8% reduction) and increasing the consistency with human experts to 0.681 (a
58.7% improvement) compared to GPT-5. The benchmark is available at

Result: 创建了CAP数据集，提供问题-答案对、token序列和相应logits，标注了科学幻觉和流畅性信息，支持幻觉检测、多语言LLM评估和可靠科学NLP系统开发。

Conclusion: CAP数据集公开发布，旨在促进幻觉检测、多语言LLM评估以及开发更可靠的科学NLP系统的先进研究。

Abstract: We introduce the CAP (Confabulations from ACL Publications) dataset, a
multilingual resource for studying hallucinations in large language models
(LLMs) within scientific text generation. CAP focuses on the scientific domain,
where hallucinations can distort factual knowledge, as they frequently do. In
this domain, however, the presence of specialized terminology, statistical
reasoning, and context-dependent interpretations further exacerbates these
distortions, particularly given LLMs' lack of true comprehension, limited
contextual understanding, and bias toward surface-level generalization. CAP
operates in a cross-lingual setting covering five high-resource languages
(English, French, Hindi, Italian, and Spanish) and four low-resource languages
(Bengali, Gujarati, Malayalam, and Telugu). The dataset comprises 900 curated
scientific questions and over 7000 LLM-generated answers from 16 publicly
available models, provided as question-answer pairs along with token sequences
and corresponding logits. Each instance is annotated with a binary label
indicating the presence of a scientific hallucination, denoted as a factuality
error, and a fluency label, capturing issues in the linguistic quality or
naturalness of the text. CAP is publicly released to facilitate advanced
research on hallucination detection, multilingual evaluation of LLMs, and the
development of more reliable scientific NLP systems.

TL;DR: CHOIR是一个测试时框架，通过协调多个角色条件下的推理信号来提升LLM推理的鲁棒性，无需额外训练即可显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现LLM在角色分配时，即使微小的身份特征变化（如代词改变）也会导致推理轨迹和正确答案的差异。与其将这些变化视为需要消除的偏见，作者探索将其作为提高推理鲁棒性的建设性资源。

Method: 提出CHOIR框架，在反事实角色之间进行协作解码，动态平衡推理路径中的一致性和分歧，将多个角色条件下的推理信号协调为统一预测。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中，CHOIR持续提升了不同人口统计群体、模型架构、规模和任务的性能，无需额外训练。个别群体改进达26.4%，五个群体平均改进19.2%。即使在基础角色不理想时仍保持有效。

Conclusion: 通过将角色变化重新定义为建设性信号，CHOIR提供了一种可扩展和通用的方法，实现了更可靠的LLM推理。

Abstract: Persona-assigned Large Language Models (LLMs) can adopt diverse roles,
enabling personalized and context-aware reasoning. However, even minor
demographic perturbations in personas, such as simple pronoun changes, can
alter reasoning trajectories, leading to divergent sets of correct answers.
Instead of treating these variations as biases to be mitigated, we explore
their potential as a constructive resource to improve reasoning robustness. We
propose CHOIR (Collaborative Harmonization fOr Inference Robustness), a
test-time framework that harmonizes multiple persona-conditioned reasoning
signals into a unified prediction. CHOIR orchestrates a collaborative decoding
process among counterfactual personas, dynamically balancing agreement and
divergence in their reasoning paths. Experiments on various reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that CHOIR consistently enhances performance across
demographics, model architectures, scales, and tasks - without additional
training. Improvements reach up to 26.4% for individual demographic groups and
19.2% on average across five demographics. It remains effective even when base
personas are suboptimal. By reframing persona variation as a constructive
signal, CHOIR provides a scalable and generalizable approach to more reliable
LLM reasoning.

Motivation: 传统上通过比较重建和声学语音学研究声调发生，但缺乏量化音高功能角色的计算方法。

Method: 通过测量音高操作对自动语音识别性能的影响，分析一组密切相关的藏语方言对音高平坦化的敏感性。

Result: 发现声调发生连续谱：无音调安多方言对音高移除容忍度最高，完全音调卫藏方言显示严重性能下降，中间康方言处于两者之间。

Conclusion: 计算方法能捕捉音变的精细阶段，传统基于最小对立对的功能负载指标可能高估过渡系统中音高的依赖性。

Abstract: Tonogenesis-the historical process by which segmental contrasts evolve into
lexical tone-has traditionally been studied through comparative reconstruction
and acoustic phonetics. We introduce a computational approach that quantifies
the functional role of pitch at different stages of this sound change by
measuring how pitch manipulation affects automatic speech recognition (ASR)
performance. Through analysis on the sensitivity to pitch-flattening from a set
of closely related Tibetan languages, we find evidence of a tonogenesis
continuum: atonal Amdo dialects tolerate pitch removal the most, while fully
tonal U-Tsang varieties show severe degradation, and intermediate Kham dialects
fall measurably between these extremes. These gradient effects demonstrate how
ASR models implicitly learn the shifting functional load of pitch as languages
transition from consonant-based to tone-based lexical contrasts. Our findings
show that computational methods can capture fine-grained stages of sound change
and suggest that traditional functional load metrics, based solely on minimal
pairs, may overestimate pitch dependence in transitional systems where
segmental and suprasegmental cues remain phonetically intertwined.

Result: 在广泛使用的基准测试中，该方法有效且在不同设置下始终优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够与各种基础剪枝技术无缝集成，在压缩过程中保持LLM的专门能力。

Abstract: Pruning provides a practical solution to reduce the resources required to run
large language models (LLMs) to benefit from their effective capabilities as
well as control their cost for training and inference. Research on LLM pruning
often ranks the importance of LLM parameters using their magnitudes and
calibration-data activations and removes (or masks) the less important ones,
accordingly reducing LLMs' size. However, these approaches primarily focus on
preserving the LLM's ability to generate fluent sentences, while neglecting
performance on specific domains and tasks. In this paper, we propose a simple
yet effective pruning approach for LLMs that preserves task-specific
capabilities while shrinking their parameter space. We first analyze how
conventional pruning minimizes loss perturbation under general-domain
calibration and extend this formulation by incorporating task-specific feature
distributions into the importance computation of existing pruning algorithms.
Thus, our framework computes separate importance scores using both general and
task-specific calibration data, partitions parameters into shared and exclusive
groups based on activation-norm differences, and then fuses their scores to
guide the pruning process. This design enables our method to integrate
seamlessly with various foundation pruning techniques and preserve the LLM's
specialized abilities under compression. Experiments on widely used benchmarks
demonstrate that our approach is effective and consistently outperforms the
baselines with identical pruning ratios and different settings.

Motivation: 研究多语言ASR模型在不同语言中学习的子词库如何被利用，以及预训练数据差异是否影响推理过程中这些标记的使用。

Method: 通过记录Whisper模型在49种语言推理过程中的解码候选子词，跟踪它们随时间的累积发现情况，分析模型子词空间的利用模式。

Result: 发现子词发现总数与语言预训练小时数无关，子词发现率遵循一致的指数饱和模式。拉丁文字的语言比西里尔、CJK和闪米特文字表现更好。

Conclusion: 多语言ASR推理中的子词利用更多受语音的统计、类型和正字法结构约束，而非训练数据规模，为更公平的语料构建和跨语言评估提供了实证基础。

Abstract: How much audio is needed to fully observe a multilingual ASR model's learned
sub-token inventory across languages, and does data disparity in multilingual
pre-training affect how these tokens are utilized during inference? We address
this question by analyzing Whisper's decoding behavior during inference across
49 languages. By logging decoding candidate sub-tokens and tracking their
cumulative discovery over time, we study the utilization pattern of the model's
sub-token space. Results show that the total number of discovered tokens
remains largely independent of a language's pre-training hours, indicating that
data disparity does not strongly influence lexical diversity in the model's
hypothesis space. Sub-token discovery rates follow a consistent exponential
saturation pattern across languages, suggesting a stable time window after
which additional audio yields minimal new sub-token activation. We refer to
this convergence threshold as acoustic saturation time (AST). Further analyses
of rank-frequency distributions reveal Zipf-like patterns better modeled by a
Zipf-Mandelbrot law, and mean sub-token length shows a positive correlation
with resource level. Additionally, those metrics show more favorable patterns
for languages in the Latin script than those in scripts such as Cyrillic, CJK,
and Semitic. Together, our study suggests that sub-token utilization during
multilingual ASR inference is constrained more by the statistical, typological,
and orthographic structure of the speech than by training data scale, providing
an empirical basis for more equitable corpus construction and cross-lingual
evaluation.

Method: 使用太平洋西北英语语料库，分析四个种族背景说话者的转录准确性，引入语音错误率指标，分析11个社会语音特征。

Result: 发现元音质量变异，特别是对低后元音合并和前鼻音合并模式的抵抗，与不同种族群体的错误率差异相关，非洲裔美国人受影响最显著。

Conclusion: 方言语音变异的声学建模是商业ASR系统偏见的主要来源，需要在训练数据中更好地代表社会语音多样性。

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic evaluation of racial bias in four major
commercial automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems using the Pacific
Northwest English (PNWE) corpus. We analyze transcription accuracy across
speakers from four ethnic backgrounds (African American, Caucasian American,
ChicanX, and Yakama) and examine how sociophonetic variation contributes to
differential system performance. We introduce a heuristically-determined
Phonetic Error Rate (PER) metric that links recognition errors to specific
linguistically motivated variables derived from sociophonetic annotation. Our
analysis of eleven sociophonetic features reveals that vowel quality variation,
particularly resistance to the low-back merger and pre-nasal merger patterns,
is systematically associated with differential error rates across ethnic
groups, with the most pronounced effects for African American speakers across
all evaluated systems. These findings demonstrate that acoustic modeling of
dialectal phonetic variation, rather than lexical or syntactic factors, remains
a primary source of bias in commercial ASR systems. The study establishes the
PNWE corpus as a valuable resource for bias evaluation in speech technologies
and provides actionable guidance for improving ASR performance through targeted
representation of sociophonetic diversity in training data.

parameter efficient adaptation (LoRA, QLoRA), and zero-shot prompting
strategies for unfair clause detection in Terms of Service (ToS) documents, a
key application in legal NLP. We finetune BERT and DistilBERT, apply 4-bit
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to models such as TinyLlama, LLaMA 3B/7B, and
SaulLM, and evaluate GPT-4o and O-versions in zero-shot settings. Experiments
on the CLAUDETTE-ToS benchmark and the Multilingual Scraper Corpus show that
full fine-tuning achieves the strongest precision recall balance, while
LoRA-based models provide competitive recall with up to 3x lower memory cost.
These findings highlight practical design trade-offs for efficient and
domain-adapted LLMs, contributing open baselines for fine-tuning research in
legal text processing.

*Ziyuan He,Yuxuan Wang,Jiaqi Li,Kexin Liang,Muhan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LooGLE v2是一个评估大语言模型在真实世界长文本应用中上下文理解能力的基准测试，涵盖法律、金融、游戏和代码等领域，文本长度从16k到2M tokens。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型拥有越来越长的上下文窗口，但它们在长依赖任务上的理解能力仍然有限且未被充分探索，特别是在许多真实世界长上下文应用中缺乏基准测试。

Method: 自动收集真实世界长文本，精心设计10种领域特定的长依赖任务，通过可扩展的数据处理流程生成1,934个QA实例，对6个本地部署和4个API-based的LLM进行综合评估。

Result: 评估结果显示，即使在最佳模型上，总体得分仅为59.2%。流行的LLM实际上只能理解比其声称长度短得多的上下文，在处理真实世界长依赖任务时存在显著局限性。

Conclusion: 尽管拥有扩展的上下文窗口，大语言模型在实际长上下文理解能力方面仍有很大改进空间，需要进一步提升处理真实世界长依赖任务的能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are equipped with increasingly extended context
windows recently, yet their long context understanding capabilities over long
dependency tasks remain fundamentally limited and underexplored. This gap is
especially significant in many real-world long-context applications that were
rarely benchmarked. In this paper, we introduce LooGLE v2, a novel benchmark
designed to evaluate LLMs' long context ability in real-world applications and
scenarios. Our benchmark consists of automatically collected real-world long
texts, ranging from 16k to 2M tokens, encompassing domains in law, finance,
game and code. Accordingly, we delicately design 10 types of domain-specific
long-dependency tasks and generate 1,934 QA instances with various diversity
and complexity in a scalable data curation pipeline for further practical
needs. We conduct a comprehensive assessment of 6 locally deployed and 4
API-based LLMs. The evaluation results show that even the best-performing model
achieves only a 59.2% overall score on our benchmark. Despite the extensive
context windows, popular LLMs are only capable of understanding a much shorter
length of context than they claim to be, revealing significant limitations in
their ability to handle real-world tasks with long dependencies and
highlighting substantial room for model improvement in practical long-context
understanding.

### [255] [SABlock: Semantic-Aware KV Cache Eviction with Adaptive Compression Block Size](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22556)
*Jinhan Chen,Jianchun Liu,Hongli Xu,Xianjun Gao,Shilong Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SABlock是一个语义感知的KV缓存驱逐框架，通过自适应块大小来平衡语义连贯性和内存效率，显著减少长上下文LLM推理中的内存占用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存不断增长的内存占用成为长上下文LLM推理的严重可扩展性瓶颈，现有压缩方法难以平衡语义连贯性和内存效率。

Method: SABlock首先进行语义分割以对齐压缩边界与语言结构，然后应用分段引导的令牌评分来优化令牌重要性估计，最后通过预算驱动的搜索策略自适应确定最优块大小。

Result: 在相同内存预算下，SABlock持续优于最先进的基线方法。在NIAH测试中，仅用96个KV条目就达到99.9%的检索准确率，接近保留8K条目的全缓存基准。在1024固定缓存预算下，峰值内存使用减少46.28%，128K上下文长度下解码速度提升高达9.5倍。

Conclusion: SABlock通过语义感知的自适应块大小策略，有效解决了KV缓存的内存瓶颈问题，在保持语义完整性的同时显著提升了压缩效率和推理性能。

Abstract: The growing memory footprint of the Key-Value (KV) cache poses a severe
scalability bottleneck for long-context Large Language Model (LLM) inference.
While KV cache eviction has emerged as an effective solution by discarding less
critical tokens, existing token-, block-, and sentence-level compression
methods struggle to balance semantic coherence and memory efficiency. To this
end, we introduce SABlock, a \underline{s}emantic-aware KV cache eviction
framework with \underline{a}daptive \underline{block} sizes. Specifically,
SABlock first performs semantic segmentation to align compression boundaries
with linguistic structures, then applies segment-guided token scoring to refine
token importance estimation. Finally, for each segment, a budget-driven search
strategy adaptively determines the optimal block size that preserves semantic
integrity while improving compression efficiency under a given cache budget.
Extensive experiments on long-context benchmarks demonstrate that SABlock
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under the same memory
budgets. For instance, on Needle-in-a-Haystack (NIAH), SABlock achieves 99.9%
retrieval accuracy with only 96 KV entries, nearly matching the performance of
the full-cache baseline that retains up to 8K entries. Under a fixed cache
budget of 1,024, SABlock further reduces peak memory usage by 46.28% and
achieves up to 9.5x faster decoding on a 128K context length.

### [256] [A Closed-Loop Personalized Learning Agent Integrating Neural Cognitive Diagnosis, Bounded-Ability Adaptive Testing, and LLM-Driven Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22559)
*Zhifeng Wang,Xinyue Zheng,Chunyan Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个端到端的个性化学习代理EduLoop-Agent，通过整合神经认知诊断模型、自适应测试策略和大型语言模型，构建了"诊断-推荐-反馈"的闭环框架，有效实现个性化学习路径生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前教育个性化方法存在建模、项目选择和反馈相互孤立的问题，导致学生模型粗糙、自适应策略受限以及反馈不够具体。

Method: 结合神经认知诊断模型(NCD)进行细粒度知识掌握评估，使用有界能力估计自适应测试策略(BECAT)动态选择项目，并利用大型语言模型(LLMs)生成结构化可操作的反馈。

Result: 在ASSISTments数据集上的实验表明，NCD模块在响应预测方面表现优异且可解释，自适应推荐策略提高了项目相关性和个性化程度，LLM反馈能提供针对性的学习指导。

Conclusion: 该设计有效且可实际部署，为智能教育中生成个性化学习轨迹提供了可行路径。

Abstract: As information technology advances, education is moving from
one-size-fits-all instruction toward personalized learning. However, most
methods handle modeling, item selection, and feedback in isolation rather than
as a closed loop. This leads to coarse or opaque student models,
assumption-bound adaptivity that ignores diagnostic posteriors, and generic,
non-actionable feedback. To address these limitations, this paper presents an
end-to-end personalized learning agent, EduLoop-Agent, which integrates a
Neural Cognitive Diagnosis model (NCD), a Bounded-Ability Estimation
Computerized Adaptive Testing strategy (BECAT), and large language models
(LLMs). The NCD module provides fine-grained estimates of students' mastery at
the knowledge-point level; BECAT dynamically selects subsequent items to
maximize relevance and learning efficiency; and LLMs convert diagnostic signals
into structured, actionable feedback. Together, these components form a
closed-loop framework of ``Diagnosis--Recommendation--Feedback.'' Experiments
on the ASSISTments dataset show that the NCD module achieves strong performance
on response prediction while yielding interpretable mastery assessments. The
adaptive recommendation strategy improves item relevance and personalization,
and the LLM-based feedback offers targeted study guidance aligned with
identified weaknesses. Overall, the results indicate that the proposed design
is effective and practically deployable, providing a feasible pathway to
generating individualized learning trajectories in intelligent education.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI模型加速了LLM驱动的智能辅导系统发展，但这些系统的进展和影响难以追踪，因为缺乏可靠、普遍接受且以教学法为导向的评估框架和基准。现有评估主要依赖主观协议和非标准化基准，导致不一致性和有限的可推广性。

Method: 作者从主流ITS开发中退一步，通过真实案例研究提供全面的最先进评估实践分析，突出相关挑战。基于先前跨学科AIED研究的见解，提出三个实用、可行且理论扎实的研究方向。

Result: 通过案例研究揭示了现有ITS评估中的不一致性和局限性，强调了标准化评估框架的缺失问题。

Conclusion: 提出了三个基于学习科学原则的研究方向，旨在建立公平、统一和可扩展的智能辅导系统评估方法，为AI教育领域的标准化评估提供实践指导。

Abstract: The interdisciplinary research domain of Artificial Intelligence in Education
(AIED) has a long history of developing Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) by
integrating insights from technological advancements, educational theories, and
cognitive psychology. The remarkable success of generative AI (GenAI) models
has accelerated the development of large language model (LLM)-powered ITSs,
which have potential to imitate human-like, pedagogically rich, and cognitively
demanding tutoring. However, the progress and impact of these systems remain
largely untraceable due to the absence of reliable, universally accepted, and
pedagogy-driven evaluation frameworks and benchmarks. Most existing educational
dialogue-based ITS evaluations rely on subjective protocols and
non-standardized benchmarks, leading to inconsistencies and limited
generalizability. In this work, we take a step back from mainstream ITS
development and provide comprehensive state-of-the-art evaluation practices,
highlighting associated challenges through real-world case studies from careful
and caring AIED research. Finally, building on insights from previous
interdisciplinary AIED research, we propose three practical, feasible, and
theoretically grounded research directions, rooted in learning science
principles and aimed at establishing fair, unified, and scalable evaluation
methodologies for ITSs.

TL;DR: AutoBench是一个全自动、自持的LLM评估框架，通过相互同行评估动态生成新颖任务，模型交替扮演问题生成者、参赛者和评委角色，使用迭代加权机制聚合同行判断形成共识排名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决静态基准测试存在的测试集污染和适应性有限的问题，为持续评估演进的语言模型提供可扩展、抗污染的替代方案。

Method: 采用相互同行评估方法，模型在不同领域交替作为问题生成者、参赛者和评委，通过迭代加权机制放大可靠评估者的影响力，聚合同行判断形成共识排名。

Result: 实验显示与MMLU-Pro和GPQA基准测试分别有78%和63%的强相关性，多评委设计显著优于单评委基线，分布式评估产生更稳健且与人类一致的评估结果。

Conclusion: AutoBench提供了一个可扩展、抗污染的替代方案，用于持续评估演进的语言模型，验证了同行驱动评估范式的有效性。

Abstract: We present AutoBench, a fully automated and self-sustaining framework for
evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) through reciprocal peer assessment.
This paper provides a rigorous scientific validation of the AutoBench
methodology, originally developed as an open-source project by eZecute S.R.L..
Unlike static benchmarks that suffer from test-set contamination and limited
adaptability, AutoBench dynamically generates novel evaluation tasks while
models alternately serve as question generators, contestants, and judges across
diverse domains. An iterative weighting mechanism amplifies the influence of
consistently reliable evaluators, aggregating peer judgments into
consensus-based rankings that reflect collective model agreement. Our
experiments demonstrate strong correlations with established benchmarks
including MMLU-Pro and GPQA (respectively 78\% and 63\%), validating this
peer-driven evaluation paradigm. The multi-judge design significantly
outperforms single-judge baselines, confirming that distributed evaluation
produces more robust and human-consistent assessments. AutoBench offers a
scalable, contamination-resistant alternative to static benchmarks for the
continuous evaluation of evolving language models.

Motivation: 基于数字基础设施和生物医学创新的成功，旨在解决传统医疗的间歇性护理问题，提供持续、实时的健康指导。

Method: 采用多模态智能体、事件中心建模和上下文推理技术，整合个人感知、体验计算和群体分析，构建环境自适应伴侣系统。

Result: PCU系统具备三个核心能力：个性化可信健康信息、主动健康导航和行为指导、医疗事件后的持续恢复和治疗反应解读。

Conclusion: PCU不仅能为个人改善健康结果，还能为公共卫生和科学发现提供新的基础，代表了医疗保健的新范式。

Abstract: Building on decades of success in digital infrastructure and biomedical
innovation, we propose the Personal Care Utility (PCU) - a cybernetic system
for lifelong health guidance. PCU is conceived as a global, AI-powered utility
that continuously orchestrates multimodal data, knowledge, and services to
assist individuals and populations alike. Drawing on multimodal agents,
event-centric modeling, and contextual inference, it offers three essential
capabilities: (1) trusted health information tailored to the individual, (2)
proactive health navigation and behavior guidance, and (3) ongoing
interpretation of recovery and treatment response after medical events. Unlike
conventional episodic care, PCU functions as an ambient, adaptive companion -
observing, interpreting, and guiding health in real time across daily life. By
integrating personal sensing, experiential computing, and population-level
analytics, PCU promises not only improved outcomes for individuals but also a
new substrate for public health and scientific discovery. We describe the
architecture, design principles, and implementation challenges of this emerging
paradigm.

TL;DR: PerCoR是首个大规模波斯语常识推理基准，包含10.6万个多项选择题，采用新颖的连接词分割策略和DRESS-AF干扰项生成方法，在保持人类可解性的同时提高了数据集难度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 创建首个大规模波斯语常识推理基准，填补波斯语自然语言处理在常识推理领域的空白，并开发有效的干扰项生成方法来提高数据集质量。

Method: 使用连接词分割策略生成连贯的句子补全对，提出DRESS-AF方法（基于嵌入相似性评分和对抗性过滤的干扰项排序），从正确答案池中选择干扰项以最大化模型混淆。

Result: 人类标注者准确率为89%，OpenAI-o3达到92.18%，Claude-Sonnet-3.7为91.17%，最强开源模型DeepSeek-R1为82.51%。DRESS-AF方法在英语HellaSwag基准上也有效提高了难度。

Conclusion: PerCoR是一个具有挑战性的波斯语常识推理基准，展示了当前模型在波斯语常识推理方面的性能差距，提出的DRESS-AF方法能有效提高数据集难度且具有跨语言适用性。

Abstract: We introduced PerCoR (Persian Commonsense Reasoning), the first large-scale
Persian benchmark for commonsense reasoning. PerCoR contains 106K
multiple-choice sentence-completion problems drawn from more than forty news,
cultural, and other web sources. We introduce a novel conjunction-based
segmentation strategy to generate coherent sentence-completion pairs, enabling
broad topical and structural diversity. To create challenging distractors, we
propose DRESS-AF (Distractor Ranking via Embedding Similarity Scoring and
Adversarial Filtering), a generation-free adversarial filtering method that
selects distractors from the pool of gold continuations while maximising model
confusion. Human annotators score 89% on PerCoR, while OpenAI-o3 achieves the
highest performance at 92.18%, followed closely by Claude-Sonnet-3.7 (91.17%).
The strongest open-source model, DeepSeek-R1, reaches 82.51%, underscoring both
the dataset's difficulty and the remaining performance gap in Persian
commonsense reasoning. We further show that DRESS-AF transfers to the English
HellaSwag benchmark, increasing its difficulty without hurting human
solvability. The dataset is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保护语言多样性，因为每种语言都提供独特的世界观。Toto语言是印度西孟加拉邦的濒危语言，需要通过数字化手段进行存档和推广。

Method: 通过田野调查收集详细的语言文档，创建词素标记的三语语料库，训练小型语言模型和基于Transformer的翻译引擎，开发脚本标准化和数字素养工具。

Result: 成功开发了包含屈折形态学（人称-数-性一致、时-体-语气区分、格标记）和派生策略分析的语言学习应用，实现了脚本标准化和数字工具集成。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个将传统语言学方法与AI技术相结合的保护濒危语言的可持续模型，强调了跨学科合作在社区语言复兴中的价值。

Abstract: Preserving linguistic diversity is necessary as every language offers a
distinct perspective on the world. There have been numerous global initiatives
to preserve endangered languages through documentation. This paper is a part of
a project which aims to develop a trilingual (Toto-Bangla-English) language
learning application to digitally archive and promote the endangered Toto
language of West Bengal, India. This application, designed for both native Toto
speakers and non-native learners, aims to revitalize the language by ensuring
accessibility and usability through Unicode script integration and a structured
language corpus. The research includes detailed linguistic documentation
collected via fieldwork, followed by the creation of a morpheme-tagged,
trilingual corpus used to train a Small Language Model (SLM) and a
Transformer-based translation engine. The analysis covers inflectional
morphology such as person-number-gender agreement, tense-aspect-mood
distinctions, and case marking, alongside derivational strategies that reflect
word-class changes. Script standardization and digital literacy tools were also
developed to enhance script usage. The study offers a sustainable model for
preserving endangered languages by incorporating traditional linguistic
methodology with AI. This bridge between linguistic research with technological
innovation highlights the value of interdisciplinary collaboration for
community-based language revitalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以捕捉复杂关系模式并缓解数据稀疏性，特别是在处理长尾分布问题时表现不佳。

Method: 使用邻域聚合编码器整合高阶邻居信息，共轭关系学习器结合隐式条件扩散关系模块和稳定关系模块，以及流形共轭解码器在流形空间中评估和推理缺失三元组。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，该方法优于现有最先进方法，取得了优越性能。

Conclusion: CR-FKGC框架有效解决了FKGC中的关键挑战，通过共轭关系建模显著提升了少样本知识图谱补全的性能。

Abstract: Few-shot Knowledge Graph Completion (FKGC) infers missing triples from
limited support samples, tackling long-tail distribution challenges. Existing
methods, however, struggle to capture complex relational patterns and mitigate
data sparsity. To address these challenges, we propose a novel FKGC framework
for conjugate relation modeling (CR-FKGC). Specifically, it employs a
neighborhood aggregation encoder to integrate higher-order neighbor
information, a conjugate relation learner combining an implicit conditional
diffusion relation module with a stable relation module to capture stable
semantics and uncertainty offsets, and a manifold conjugate decoder for
efficient evaluation and inference of missing triples in manifold space.
Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves superior
performance over state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个用于解释检索增强生成(RAG)大语言模型的规则生成方法，通过分析检索源与模型输出的关系来揭示输出来源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着RAG技术在LLM中的广泛应用，需要可解释的方法来理解检索源如何影响模型输出，传统规则解释方法无法直接应用于这种动态检索场景。

Method: 提出基于Apriori剪枝优化的规则生成算法，通过系统性地测试不同检索源组合对LLM输出的影响，识别出关键的条件-结果规则。

Result: 实验证明该方法能有效生成解释性规则，如"如果检索到泰晤士高等教育排名文章，则LLM将牛津大学排在第一"，且优化算法显著提高了规则生成效率。

Conclusion: 该研究为RAG-LLM系统提供了首个可解释性框架，通过规则揭示检索源与输出之间的因果关系，有助于增强模型透明度和可信度。

Abstract: If-then rules are widely used to explain machine learning models; e.g., "if
employed = no, then loan application = rejected." We present the first proposal
to apply rules to explain the emerging class of large language models (LLMs)
with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Since RAG enables LLM systems to
incorporate retrieved information sources at inference time, rules linking the
presence or absence of sources can explain output provenance; e.g., "if a Times
Higher Education ranking article is retrieved, then the LLM ranks Oxford
first." To generate such rules, a brute force approach would probe the LLM with
all source combinations and check if the presence or absence of any sources
leads to the same output. We propose optimizations to speed up rule generation,
inspired by Apriori-like pruning from frequent itemset mining but redefined
within the scope of our novel problem. We conclude with qualitative and
quantitative experiments demonstrating our solutions' value and efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管指令调优的大语言模型具有强大的泛化能力，但在文本分类基准测试中表现不佳，需要改进其分类性能。

Method: 将每个类别标签映射到不同的输出标记，构建提示以引发单标记响应，在推理时仅将模型输出投影到相关类别标记的logits上。

Result: SALSA在多个基准测试中取得了最先进的结果，证明了其在基于LLM的分类应用中的鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: SALSA通过结构化提示和参数高效微调，显著提升了LLM在文本分类任务上的性能，为LLM分类应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite their impressive generalization capabilities, instruction-tuned Large
Language Models often underperform on text classification benchmarks. We
introduce SALSA, a coherent pipeline that combines structured prompting,
class-to-token mapping, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, thereby avoiding
cold-start training. Each class label is mapped to a distinct output token, and
prompts are constructed to elicit a single-token response. During inference,
the model's output is projected only onto the logits of the relevant class
tokens, enabling efficient and accurate classification in a single forward
pass. SALSA achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse benchmarks,
demonstrating its robustness and scalability for LLM-based classification
applications.

TL;DR: 提出E²Rank框架，通过列表排序目标继续训练单个文本嵌入模型，使其既能进行高质量检索又能执行列表重排序，在保持效率的同时显著提升重排序性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统文本嵌入模型在检索效率方面表现优异，但在排序保真度方面不如专门的reranker，特别是基于LLM的列表重排序器。需要统一检索和重排序功能。

Method: 使用查询和文档嵌入的余弦相似度作为统一排序函数，构建包含原始查询和候选文档的列表排序提示，类似于传统检索中的伪相关反馈(PRF)。

Result: 在BEIR重排序基准测试中达到最先进水平，在BRIGHT推理密集型基准上表现有竞争力，重排序延迟极低，且在MTEB基准上嵌入性能也有所提升。

Conclusion: 单个嵌入模型可以有效统一检索和重排序功能，在计算效率和排序准确性方面都具有竞争力。

Abstract: Text embedding models serve as a fundamental component in real-world search
applications. By mapping queries and documents into a shared embedding space,
they deliver competitive retrieval performance with high efficiency. However,
their ranking fidelity remains limited compared to dedicated rerankers,
especially recent LLM-based listwise rerankers, which capture fine-grained
query-document and document-document interactions. In this paper, we propose a
simple yet effective unified framework $\text{E}^2\text{Rank}$, means Efficient
Embedding-based Ranking (also means Embedding-to-Rank), which extends a single
text embedding model to perform both high-quality retrieval and listwise
reranking through continued training under a listwise ranking objective,
thereby achieving strong effectiveness with remarkable efficiency. By applying
cosine similarity between the query and document embeddings as a unified
ranking function, the listwise ranking prompt, which is constructed from the
original query and its candidate documents, serves as an enhanced query
enriched with signals from the top-K documents, akin to pseudo-relevance
feedback (PRF) in traditional retrieval models. This design preserves the
efficiency and representational quality of the base embedding model while
significantly improving its reranking performance. Empirically,
$\textrm{E}^2\text{Rank}$ achieves state-of-the-art results on the BEIR
reranking benchmark and demonstrates competitive performance on the
reasoning-intensive BRIGHT benchmark, with very low reranking latency. We also
show that the ranking training process improves embedding performance on the
MTEB benchmark. Our findings indicate that a single embedding model can
effectively unify retrieval and reranking, offering both computational
efficiency and competitive ranking accuracy.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型主要局限于高资源语言的问题，探索在有限数据和计算资源下将模型适配到低资源方言的方法，为少数语言群体提供高质量LLM访问。

Method: 采用低秩适应(LoRA)和计算高效的持续预训练方法，仅更新不到1%的模型参数，使用小规模数据集将三个LLM适配到魁北克法语方言。

Result: 在COLE套件基准测试中，方言性能显著提升，同时对主流语言基准测试的回归最小，性能增益高度依赖于语料库组成。

Conclusion: 参数高效微调(PEFT)的持续预训练能够以成本效益高的方式缩小方言差距，为少数语言群体扩展高质量LLM访问，并发布了首个魁北克法语LLM。

Abstract: Despite the widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs), their
strongest capabilities remain largely confined to a small number of
high-resource languages for which there is abundant training data. Recently,
continual pre-training (CPT) has emerged as a means to fine-tune these models
to low-resource regional dialects. In this paper, we study the use of CPT for
dialect learning under tight data and compute budgets. Using low-rank
adaptation (LoRA) and compute-efficient continual pre-training, we adapt three
LLMs to the Qu\'ebec French dialect using a very small dataset and benchmark
them on the COLE suite. Our experiments demonstrate an improvement on the
minority dialect benchmarks with minimal regression on the prestige language
benchmarks with under 1% of model parameters updated. Analysis of the results
demonstrate that gains are highly contingent on corpus composition. These
findings indicate that CPT with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) can
narrow the dialect gap by providing cost-effective and sustainable language
resource creation, expanding high-quality LLM access to minority linguistic
communities. We release the first Qu\'ebec French LLMs on HuggingFace.

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型在上下文学习中的时间偏差，发现模型在预测下一个token时倾向于选择序列开头或结尾附近重复出现的token，这与人类情景记忆的时间分离机制类似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大型语言模型如何像人类情景记忆一样，通过时间关系来区分和检索上下文信息，理解模型在上下文学习中的时间偏差机制。

Method: 通过向不同预训练LLM（包括transformer和状态空间模型）输入包含重复token的序列，固定重复token位置并置换其他token，消除语义干扰来孤立时间效应。使用消融实验分析transformer中的归纳头作用。

Result: 模型在预测时对重复token后的token赋予最高概率，但存在明显偏向序列开头或结尾的偏差。中间位置嵌入的记忆检索可靠性较低。transformer和状态空间模型表现出相似的时间偏差。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了上下文学习中时间偏差的存在，这些偏差能够实现时间分离和情景检索，深化了对模型记忆检索机制的理解。

Abstract: In-context learning is governed by both temporal and semantic relationships,
shaping how Large Language Models (LLMs) retrieve contextual information.
Analogous to human episodic memory, where the retrieval of specific events is
enabled by separating events that happened at different times, this work probes
the ability of various pretrained LLMs, including transformer and state-space
models, to differentiate and retrieve temporally separated events.
Specifically, we prompted models with sequences containing multiple
presentations of the same token, which reappears at the sequence end. By fixing
the positions of these repeated tokens and permuting all others, we removed
semantic confounds and isolated temporal effects on next-token prediction.
Across diverse sequences, models consistently placed the highest probabilities
on tokens following a repeated token, but with a notable bias for those nearest
the beginning or end of the input. An ablation experiment linked this
phenomenon in transformers to induction heads. Extending the analysis to unique
semantic contexts with partial overlap further demonstrated that memories
embedded in the middle of a prompt are retrieved less reliably. Despite
architectural differences, state-space and transformer models showed comparable
temporal biases. Our findings deepen the understanding of temporal biases in
in-context learning and offer an illustration of how these biases can enable
temporal separation and episodic retrieval.

TL;DR: EchoMind是首个关联多层次的基准测试，通过顺序任务评估语音语言模型在共情对话中的表现，发现现有模型在处理高表达性语音线索方面存在困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试通常孤立评估语言、声学、推理或对话能力，忽视了这些技能整合对于实现人类般情感智能对话的重要性。

Method: 设计EchoMind基准，包含口语内容理解、语音线索感知、整合推理和响应生成四个顺序任务，使用语义中性脚本和受控的语音风格变化。

Result: 测试12个先进SLM显示，即使最先进的模型也难以处理高表达性语音线索，限制了共情响应质量。在指令遵循、自然语音变化适应性和有效利用语音线索方面存在持续弱点。

Conclusion: 需要开发能够整合语言内容和多样化语音线索的SLM，以实现真正的共情对话能力。

Abstract: Speech Language Models (SLMs) have made significant progress in spoken
language understanding. Yet it remains unclear whether they can fully perceive
non lexical vocal cues alongside spoken words, and respond with empathy that
aligns with both emotional and contextual factors. Existing benchmarks
typically evaluate linguistic, acoustic, reasoning, or dialogue abilities in
isolation, overlooking the integration of these skills that is crucial for
human-like, emotionally intelligent conversation. We present EchoMind, the
first interrelated, multi-level benchmark that simulates the cognitive process
of empathetic dialogue through sequential, context-linked tasks: spoken-content
understanding, vocal-cue perception, integrated reasoning, and response
generation. All tasks share identical and semantically neutral scripts that are
free of explicit emotional or contextual cues, and controlled variations in
vocal style are used to test the effect of delivery independent of the
transcript. EchoMind is grounded in an empathy-oriented framework spanning 3
coarse and 12 fine-grained dimensions, encompassing 39 vocal attributes, and
evaluated using both objective and subjective metrics. Testing 12 advanced SLMs
reveals that even state-of-the-art models struggle with high-expressive vocal
cues, limiting empathetic response quality. Analyses of prompt strength, speech
source, and ideal vocal cue recognition reveal persistent weaknesses in
instruction-following, resilience to natural speech variability, and effective
use of vocal cues for empathy. These results underscore the need for SLMs that
integrate linguistic content with diverse vocal cues to achieve truly
empathetic conversational ability.

TL;DR: MMPersuade框架系统研究大型视觉语言模型在多模态说服中的动态，发现多模态输入显著增强说服效果，先验偏好降低易感性，不同说服策略在不同情境下效果各异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LVLMs在购物、健康、新闻等领域的部署，它们面临普遍的说服性内容。关键问题是这些模型如何作为被说服者被多模态输入影响，因为过度易受影响的模型可能采纳误导性信念、覆盖用户偏好或生成不道德输出。

Method: 提出MMPersuade框架，包括：(i)包含图像和视频的多模态数据集，涵盖商业、主观行为和对立情境的说服原则；(ii)通过第三方协议评分和对话历史中自估计标记概率来量化说服效果和模型易感性的评估框架。

Result: 对六个领先LVLMs的研究发现：(i)多模态输入相比纯文本显著提高说服效果和模型易感性，尤其在错误信息场景；(ii)先验偏好降低易感性，但多模态信息保持说服优势；(iii)不同策略在不同情境下效果不同，互惠在商业和主观情境最有效，可信度和逻辑在对立情境占主导。

Conclusion: 通过联合分析说服效果和易感性，MMPersuade为开发在面对说服性多模态内容时稳健、偏好一致且符合伦理的模型提供了原则性基础。

Abstract: As Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are increasingly deployed in domains
such as shopping, health, and news, they are exposed to pervasive persuasive
content. A critical question is how these models function as persuadees-how and
why they can be influenced by persuasive multimodal inputs. Understanding both
their susceptibility to persuasion and the effectiveness of different
persuasive strategies is crucial, as overly persuadable models may adopt
misleading beliefs, override user preferences, or generate unethical or unsafe
outputs when exposed to manipulative messages. We introduce MMPersuade, a
unified framework for systematically studying multimodal persuasion dynamics in
LVLMs. MMPersuade contributes (i) a comprehensive multimodal dataset that pairs
images and videos with established persuasion principles across commercial,
subjective and behavioral, and adversarial contexts, and (ii) an evaluation
framework that quantifies both persuasion effectiveness and model
susceptibility via third-party agreement scoring and self-estimated token
probabilities on conversation histories. Our study of six leading LVLMs as
persuadees yields three key insights: (i) multimodal inputs substantially
increase persuasion effectiveness-and model susceptibility-compared to text
alone, especially in misinformation scenarios; (ii) stated prior preferences
decrease susceptibility, yet multimodal information maintains its persuasive
advantage; and (iii) different strategies vary in effectiveness across
contexts, with reciprocity being most potent in commercial and subjective
contexts, and credibility and logic prevailing in adversarial contexts. By
jointly analyzing persuasion effectiveness and susceptibility, MMPersuade
provides a principled foundation for developing models that are robust,
preference-consistent, and ethically aligned when engaging with persuasive
multimodal content.

Motivation: 现有基于测试的监督方法存在可扩展性限制：测试沙箱构建运行成本高且脆弱，高覆盖率测试数据稀缺且易受边缘案例测试黑客攻击。

Method: R4P将补丁验证视为推理任务，采用群体目标进行强化学习训练，能够验证多个补丁并相互比较修改，获得密集奖励以实现稳定训练。

Result: R4P在SWE-bench-verified上达到72.2%的补丁验证准确率，超越OpenAI o3。基于R4P训练的Mini-SE在SWE-bench-verified上达到26.2% Pass@1，比原Qwen3-32B提升10.0%。R4P验证补丁仅需1秒，比平均测试快50倍。

Conclusion: R4P通过推理驱动的补丁验证为软件工程代理提供了高效、可扩展的奖励机制，解决了传统测试监督的可扩展性瓶颈。

Abstract: While large language model agents have advanced software engineering tasks,
the unscalable nature of existing test-based supervision is limiting the
potential improvement of data scaling. The reason is twofold: (1) building and
running test sandbox is rather heavy and fragile, and (2) data with
high-coverage tests is naturally rare and threatened by test hacking via edge
cases. In this paper, we propose R4P, a patch verifier model to provide
scalable rewards for training and testing SWE agents via reasoning. We consider
that patch verification is fundamentally a reasoning task, mirroring how human
repository maintainers review patches without writing and running new
reproduction tests. To obtain sufficient reference and reduce the risk of
reward hacking, R4P uses a group-wise objective for RL training, enabling it to
verify multiple patches against each other's modification and gain a dense
reward for stable training. R4P achieves 72.2% Acc. for verifying patches from
SWE-bench-verified, surpassing OpenAI o3. To demonstrate R4P's practicality, we
design and train a lite scaffold, Mini-SE, with pure reinforcement learning
where all rewards are derived from R4P. As a result, Mini-SE achieves 26.2%
Pass@1 on SWE-bench-verified, showing a 10.0% improvement over the original
Qwen3-32B. This can be further improved to 32.8% with R4P for test-time
scaling. Furthermore, R4P verifies patches within a second, 50x faster than
testing on average. The stable scaling curves of rewards and accuracy along
with high efficiency reflect R4P's practicality.

Motivation: 人道组织面临关键选择：投资昂贵的商业API还是依赖免费的开源模型进行多语言人权监控。商业系统提供可靠性，但开源替代方案缺乏实证验证——特别是在冲突地区常见的低资源语言方面。

Method: 在78,000次多语言推理中评估六个模型（四个对齐模型和两个开源模型），使用标准分类指标和新的跨语言可靠性度量：校准偏差、决策偏差、语言鲁棒性得分和语言稳定性得分。

Result: 结果显示对齐而非规模决定稳定性：对齐模型在类型学差异大和低资源语言中保持近乎不变的准确性和平衡校准，而开源模型表现出显著的提示-语言敏感性和校准漂移。

Conclusion: 多语言对齐实现了语言无关的推理，为人道组织在多语言部署中平衡预算约束与可靠性提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Humanitarian organizations face a critical choice: invest in costly
commercial APIs or rely on free open-weight models for multilingual human
rights monitoring. While commercial systems offer reliability, open-weight
alternatives lack empirical validation -- especially for low-resource languages
common in conflict zones. This paper presents the first systematic comparison
of commercial and open-weight large language models (LLMs) for
human-rights-violation detection across seven languages, quantifying the
cost-reliability trade-off facing resource-constrained organizations. Across
78,000 multilingual inferences, we evaluate six models -- four
instruction-aligned (Claude-Sonnet-4, DeepSeek-V3, Gemini-Flash-2.0,
GPT-4.1-mini) and two open-weight (LLaMA-3-8B, Mistral-7B) -- using both
standard classification metrics and new measures of cross-lingual reliability:
Calibration Deviation (CD), Decision Bias (B), Language Robustness Score (LRS),
and Language Stability Score (LSS). Results show that alignment, not scale,
determines stability: aligned models maintain near-invariant accuracy and
balanced calibration across typologically distant and low-resource languages
(e.g., Lingala, Burmese), while open-weight models exhibit significant
prompt-language sensitivity and calibration drift. These findings demonstrate
that multilingual alignment enables language-agnostic reasoning and provide
practical guidance for humanitarian organizations balancing budget constraints
with reliability in multilingual deployment.

Motivation: 理解小组对话中思想的发展和流动对于分析协作学习至关重要。话题线索作为对话的结构特征，在异步文本环境中已被广泛研究，但在同步口语对话中检测线索仍然具有挑战性。同时，大型语言模型在自动化话语分析方面显示出潜力，但在需要追踪对话链接的长上下文任务中常常表现不佳。

Conclusion: 这项工作推进了将LLM与稳健的对话线索结构相结合的方法，以理解复杂的实时群体互动。

Abstract: Understanding how ideas develop and flow in small-group conversations is
critical for analyzing collaborative learning. A key structural feature of
these interactions is threading, the way discourse talk naturally organizes
into interwoven topical strands that evolve over time. While threading has been
widely studied in asynchronous text settings, detecting threads in synchronous
spoken dialogue remains challenging due to overlapping turns and implicit cues.
At the same time, large language models (LLMs) show promise for automating
discourse analysis but often struggle with long-context tasks that depend on
tracing these conversational links. In this paper, we investigate whether
explicit thread linkages can improve LLM-based coding of relational moves in
group talk. We contribute a systematic guidebook for identifying threads in
synchronous multi-party transcripts and benchmark different LLM prompting
strategies for automated threading. We then test how threading influences
performance on downstream coding of conversational analysis frameworks, that
capture core collaborative actions such as agreeing, building, and eliciting.
Our results show that providing clear conversational thread information
improves LLM coding performance and underscores the heavy reliance of
downstream analysis on well-structured dialogue. We also discuss practical
trade-offs in time and cost, emphasizing where human-AI hybrid approaches can
yield the best value. Together, this work advances methods for combining LLMs
and robust conversational thread structures to make sense of complex, real-time
group interactions.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在零样本推理方面表现出色，但在复杂多步推理任务中仍存在困难。现有的CoT和PoT方法虽然能提升性能，但经常产生不理想的解决方案，特别是在算法领域。

Method: PIPS方法在实例级别生成和优化程序，使用结构反馈而不依赖任务特定指导或显式测试用例。还包含置信度指标，动态选择直接推理或程序合成。

Result: 在3个前沿LLM和30个基准测试中，PIPS相比PoT和CoT分别将绝对调和平均准确率提升8.6%和9.4%，在算法任务中比PoT减少65.1%的不良程序生成。

Conclusion: PIPS通过实例级程序合成和结构反馈，在复杂推理任务中显著优于现有方法，有效减少了不良解决方案的产生。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at zero-shot inference but continue to
struggle with complex, multi-step reasoning. Recent methods that augment LLMs
with intermediate reasoning steps such as Chain of Thought (CoT) and Program of
Thought (PoT) improve performance but often produce undesirable solutions,
especially in algorithmic domains. We introduce Per-Instance Program Synthesis
(PIPS), a method that generates and refines programs at the instance-level
using structural feedback without relying on task-specific guidance or explicit
test cases. To further improve performance, PIPS incorporates a confidence
metric that dynamically chooses between direct inference and program synthesis
on a per-instance basis. Experiments across three frontier LLMs and 30
benchmarks including all tasks of Big Bench Extra Hard (BBEH), visual question
answering tasks, relational reasoning tasks, and mathematical reasoning tasks
show that PIPS improves the absolute harmonic mean accuracy by up to 8.6% and
9.4% compared to PoT and CoT respectively, and reduces undesirable program
generations by 65.1% on the algorithmic tasks compared to PoT with
Gemini-2.0-Flash.

TL;DR: 提出了一种残差解缠方法，从语言模型中分离出词汇、句法、意义和推理四个几乎正交的嵌入表示，用于分析大脑对语言处理的神经机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型的内部表示高度"纠缠"，混合了词汇、句法、意义和推理信息，这导致传统脑编码分析偏向于浅层语言特征，难以分离认知深层过程的神经基础。

Method: 通过探测语言模型识别特征特定层，迭代回归掉低层表示，生成四个正交嵌入：词汇、句法、意义和推理。使用这些解缠嵌入建模颅内脑电图记录。

Result: 1) 推理嵌入具有独特预测能力，能解释其他语言特征无法解释的神经活动方差，甚至扩展到经典语言区域之外的视觉区域；2) 推理的神经信号时间上更晚（350-400ms），符合处理层次顶端的定位；3) 标准非解缠嵌入可能产生误导，其预测成功主要归因于浅层语言特征。

Conclusion: 解缠方法揭示了推理处理的独特神经特征，表明深层认知过程在大脑中有特定的时空表征，而传统方法可能掩盖这些微妙贡献。

Abstract: Understanding how the human brain progresses from processing simple
linguistic inputs to performing high-level reasoning is a fundamental challenge
in neuroscience. While modern large language models (LLMs) are increasingly
used to model neural responses to language, their internal representations are
highly "entangled," mixing information about lexicon, syntax, meaning, and
reasoning. This entanglement biases conventional brain encoding analyses toward
linguistically shallow features (e.g., lexicon and syntax), making it difficult
to isolate the neural substrates of cognitively deeper processes. Here, we
introduce a residual disentanglement method that computationally isolates these
components. By first probing an LM to identify feature-specific layers, our
method iteratively regresses out lower-level representations to produce four
nearly orthogonal embeddings for lexicon, syntax, meaning, and, critically,
reasoning. We used these disentangled embeddings to model intracranial (ECoG)
brain recordings from neurosurgical patients listening to natural speech. We
show that: 1) This isolated reasoning embedding exhibits unique predictive
power, accounting for variance in neural activity not explained by other
linguistic features and even extending to the recruitment of visual regions
beyond classical language areas. 2) The neural signature for reasoning is
temporally distinct, peaking later (~350-400ms) than signals related to
lexicon, syntax, and meaning, consistent with its position atop a processing
hierarchy. 3) Standard, non-disentangled LLM embeddings can be misleading, as
their predictive success is primarily attributable to linguistically shallow
features, masking the more subtle contributions of deeper cognitive processing.

TL;DR: 研究发现大语言模型存在不确定性现象，即模型会将先前正确的答案翻转为错误答案。通过识别并屏蔽少数关注误导性标记的注意力头，可将翻转行为减少15%，但下游任务存在权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在重新提示时会改变先前正确的答案，这种不确定性行为会破坏信任并在高风险领域带来严重风险，需要研究其机制并找到缓解方法。

Method: 采用Needle-in-a-Haystack检索框架，集成Flip式重新评估提示来模拟真实的答案翻转场景，识别并分析导致不确定性的注意力头。

Result: 发现检索头不是避免不确定性的主要原因，而是少数非检索注意力头会过度关注误导性标记。屏蔽这些头可将翻转行为减少15%，且不会引入不连贯或过度校正。

Conclusion: 研究为机械可解释性领域做出贡献，提供了一种简单有效的技术来缓解LLM中不确定性驱动的故障模式，但在下游任务中存在权衡。

Abstract: Despite their impressive capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit
unwanted uncertainty, a phenomenon where a model changes a previously correct
answer into an incorrect one when re-prompted. This behavior undermines trust
and poses serious risks in high-stakes domains. In this work, we investigate
the mechanisms that drive this phenomenon. We adapt the Needle-in-a-Haystack
retrieval framework and integrate a Flip-style re-evaluation prompt to simulate
realistic answer-flipping scenarios. We find that retrieval heads are not
primarily responsible for avoiding uncertainty. Instead, we identify a small
set of non-retrieval attention heads that disproportionately attend to
misleading tokens in uncertain contexts. Masking these heads yields significant
improvements, reducing flip behavior by up to 15% without introducing
incoherence or overcorrection. However, when tested for downstream tasks, we
observe trade-offs with flip behavior. Our findings contribute to the growing
field of mechanistic interpretability and present a simple yet effective
technique for mitigating uncertainty-driven failure modes in LLMs.

detecting AI-generated text and attributing it to specific models requires
large-scale, diverse, and well-annotated datasets. In this work, we present a
comprehensive dataset comprising over 58,000 text samples that combine
authentic New York Times articles with synthetic versions generated by multiple
state-of-the-art LLMs including Gemma-2-9b, Mistral-7B, Qwen-2-72B, LLaMA-8B,
Yi-Large, and GPT-4-o. The dataset provides original article abstracts as
prompts, full human-authored narratives. We establish baseline results for two
key tasks: distinguishing human-written from AI-generated text, achieving an
accuracy of 58.35\%, and attributing AI texts to their generating models with
an accuracy of 8.92\%. By bridging real-world journalistic content with modern
generative models, the dataset aims to catalyze the development of robust
detection and attribution methods, fostering trust and transparency in the era
of generative AI. Our dataset is available at:

### [281] [Batch Speculative Decoding Done Right](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22876)
*Ranran Haoran Zhang,Soumik Dey,Ashirbad Mishra,Hansi Wu,Binbin Li,Rui Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了EQSPEC和EXSPEC两种批量推测解码方法，解决了批量处理中的不规则张量问题，在保持输出等价性的同时显著提升了推理吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推测解码通过使用小型草稿模型并行验证多个token来加速LLM推理，但在批量处理时会出现不规则张量问题，导致位置ID、注意力掩码和KV缓存状态损坏，现有实现违反输出等价性要求。

Method: 首先分析保证正确性的同步要求，提出EQSPEC方法暴露重对齐开销，然后引入EXSPEC方法维护滑动序列池并动态形成等长分组，减少重对齐开销同时保持每个序列的推测加速效果。

Result: 在SpecBench数据集上，针对Vicuna-7B/68M、Qwen3-8B/0.6B和GLM-4-9B/0.6B目标/草稿模型对，在批量大小为8时相比批量大小为1实现了最高3倍的吞吐量提升，同时保持95%的输出等价性。

Conclusion: 该方法无需自定义内核，可干净地集成到现有推理栈中，有效解决了批量推测解码中的正确性问题，实现了高效的批量扩展。

Abstract: Speculative decoding speeds up LLM inference by using a small draft model to
propose multiple tokens that a target model verifies in parallel. Extending
this idea to batches is essential for production serving, but it introduces the
ragged tensor problem: sequences in the same batch accept different numbers of
draft tokens, breaking right-alignment and corrupting position IDs, attention
masks, and KV-cache state. We show that several existing batch implementations
violate output equivalence-the fundamental requirement that speculative
decoding must produce identical token sequences to standard autoregressive
generation. These violations occur precisely due to improper handling of the
ragged tensor problem. In response, we (1) characterize the synchronization
requirements that guarantee correctness, (2) present a correctness-first batch
speculative decoding EQSPEC that exposes realignment as consuming 40% of
overhead, and (3) introduce EXSPEC, which maintains a sliding pool of sequences
and dynamically forms same-length groups, to reduce the realignment overhead
while preserving per-sequence speculative speedups. On the SpecBench dataset,
across Vicuna-7B/68M, Qwen3-8B/0.6B, and GLM-4-9B/0.6B target/draft pairs, our
approach achieves up to 3$\times$ throughput improvement at batch size 8
compared to batch size 1, with efficient scaling through batch size 8, while
maintaining 95% output equivalence. Our method requires no custom kernels and
integrates cleanly with existing inference stacks. Our code is available at

### [282] [Language Server CLI Empowers Language Agents with Process Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22907)
*Yifan Zhang,Lanser Contributors*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Lanser-CLI是一个CLI优先的编排层，通过语言服务器协议为编码代理和CI提供确定性、可重放的工作流，解决了大语言模型在API幻觉和编辑定位方面的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型经常产生API幻觉和错误定位编辑，而语言服务器能够计算关于真实代码的已验证IDE级事实。需要一种方法来桥接这两者，提供确定性的工作流程。

Method: 开发Lanser-CLI，包含：1）基于Selector DSL的鲁棒寻址方案；2）确定性分析包；3）变异操作的安全信封；4）基于语言服务器事实的过程奖励函数。

Result: 建立了在冻结快照下的确定性形式化，并为过程奖励建立了单调性属性，使其适用于过程监督和反事实分析。

Conclusion: 语言服务器不仅提供结构信息，还提供可操作的过程奖励，使代理的规划循环与程序现实对齐。Lanser-CLI为编码代理和CI提供了可靠的基础设施。

Abstract: Large language models routinely hallucinate APIs and mislocalize edits, while
language servers compute verified, IDE-grade facts about real code. We present
Lanser-CLI, a CLI-first orchestration layer that pins and mediates a Language
Server Protocol (LSP) server for coding agents and CI, exposing deterministic,
replayable workflows. Our position is that language servers provide not only
structural information (definitions, references, types, diagnostics) but also
an actionable process reward: machine-checked, step-wise signals that align an
agent's planning loop with program reality. In this work, Lanser-CLI
contributes: (i) a robust addressing scheme beyond brittle "file:line:col" via
a Selector DSL (symbolic, AST-path, and content-anchored selectors) with a
principled relocation algorithm; (ii) deterministic Analysis Bundles that
normalize Language Server responses and capture environment/capability metadata
with stable content hashes; (iii) a safety envelope for mutating operations
(rename, code actions) with preview, workspace jails, and Git-aware,
transactional apply; and (iv) a process-reward functional derived from Language
Server facts (diagnostic deltas, disambiguation confidence, and safe-apply
checks) that is computable online and replayable offline. We formalize
determinism under frozen snapshots and establish a monotonicity property for
the process reward, making it suitable for process supervision and
counterfactual analysis. Project Page:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了Infinity-Chat数据集，用于评估语言模型在开放性问题上的多样性，揭示了语言模型存在严重的模式崩溃和人工蜂群效应问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在生成多样化、类似人类的创意内容方面存在困难，这可能导致人类思维长期同质化，但目前缺乏可扩展的方法来评估语言模型输出的多样性。

Method: 引入Infinity-Chat数据集，包含26K个多样化的真实世界开放性问题，建立了首个全面的开放性问题分类法，包含6个顶级类别和17个子类别，并收集了31,250个人类标注。

Result: 研究发现语言模型存在明显的模式崩溃和人工蜂群效应：(1)模型内重复，单个模型生成相似回答；(2)模型间同质性，不同模型产生惊人相似的输出。语言模型、奖励模型和语言模型评判者对引发不同个体偏好的模型生成内容的人类评分校准较差。

Conclusion: Infinity-Chat为系统研究真实世界开放性问题提供了首个大规模资源，揭示了缓解人工蜂群效应带来的长期AI安全风险的关键见解。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) often struggle to generate diverse, human-like creative
content, raising concerns about the long-term homogenization of human thought
through repeated exposure to similar outputs. Yet scalable methods for
evaluating LM output diversity remain limited, especially beyond narrow tasks
such as random number or name generation, or beyond repeated sampling from a
single model. We introduce Infinity-Chat, a large-scale dataset of 26K diverse,
real-world, open-ended user queries that admit a wide range of plausible
answers with no single ground truth. We introduce the first comprehensive
taxonomy for characterizing the full spectrum of open-ended prompts posed to
LMs, comprising 6 top-level categories (e.g., brainstorm & ideation) that
further breaks down to 17 subcategories. Using Infinity-Chat, we present a
large-scale study of mode collapse in LMs, revealing a pronounced Artificial
Hivemind effect in open-ended generation of LMs, characterized by (1)
intra-model repetition, where a single model consistently generates similar
responses, and more so (2) inter-model homogeneity, where different models
produce strikingly similar outputs. Infinity-Chat also includes 31,250 human
annotations, across absolute ratings and pairwise preferences, with 25
independent human annotations per example. This enables studying collective and
individual-specific human preferences in response to open-ended queries. Our
findings show that LMs, reward models, and LM judges are less well calibrated
to human ratings on model generations that elicit differing idiosyncratic
annotator preferences, despite maintaining comparable overall quality. Overall,
INFINITY-CHAT presents the first large-scale resource for systematically
studying real-world open-ended queries to LMs, revealing critical insights to
guide future research for mitigating long-term AI safety risks posed by the
Artificial Hivemind.

TL;DR: 提出TAG（标签增强生成）方法，通过在长上下文场景中添加标签来提升LLM性能，无需改变文档完整性，在NoLima和NovelQA基准上取得显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在长上下文问答和推理方面存在局限，RAG等方法依赖复杂预处理且对分块策略敏感，需要更轻量化的解决方案。

Method: 使用标签增强生成策略，在上下文或提示中添加标签定义，保持文档完整性同时提升模型理解能力。

Result: 在32K token上下文中性能提升达17%，复杂多跳推理问答提升2.9%，在NoLima和NovelQA基准上表现一致改善。

Conclusion: TAG是一种轻量有效的数据增强方法，能显著提升LLM在长上下文场景下的性能，无需复杂预处理步骤。

Abstract: Recent investigations into effective context lengths of modern flagship large
language models (LLMs) have revealed major limitations in effective question
answering (QA) and reasoning over long and complex contexts for even the
largest and most impressive cadre of models. While approaches like
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and chunk-based re-ranking attempt to
mitigate this issue, they are sensitive to chunking, embedding and retrieval
strategies and models, and furthermore, rely on extensive pre-processing,
knowledge acquisition and indexing steps. In this paper, we propose
Tagging-Augmented Generation (TAG), a lightweight data augmentation strategy
that boosts LLM performance in long-context scenarios, without degrading and
altering the integrity and composition of retrieved documents. We validate our
hypothesis by augmenting two challenging and directly relevant
question-answering benchmarks -- NoLima and NovelQA -- and show that tagging
the context or even just adding tag definitions into QA prompts leads to
consistent performance gains over the baseline -- up to 17% for 32K token
contexts, and 2.9% in complex reasoning question-answering for multi-hop
queries requiring knowledge across a wide span of text. Additional details are

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个系统化评估长文本事实准确性的框架，包括构建中文长文本数据集LongHalluQA、开发基于辩论的多智能体验证系统MAD-Fact，以及引入事实重要性层次结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在生物医学、法律、教育等高风险领域的广泛应用引发了对其输出事实准确性的担忧，现有短文本评估方法难以应对长文本中复杂的推理链、交织观点和累积信息。

Method: 构建LongHalluQA中文长文本事实性数据集；开发MAD-Fact基于辩论的多智能体验证系统；引入事实重要性层次结构来捕捉长文本中不同声明的重要性差异。

Result: 在两个基准测试上的实验表明，更大的LLM通常保持更高的事实一致性，而国产模型在中文内容上表现更优。

Conclusion: 该工作为评估和增强长文本LLM输出的事实可靠性提供了结构化框架，指导其在敏感领域的安全部署。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) raises critical
concerns about the factual accuracy of their outputs, especially in high-risk
domains such as biomedicine, law, and education. Existing evaluation methods
for short texts often fail on long-form content due to complex reasoning
chains, intertwined perspectives, and cumulative information. To address this,
we propose a systematic approach integrating large-scale long-form datasets,
multi-agent verification mechanisms, and weighted evaluation metrics. We
construct LongHalluQA, a Chinese long-form factuality dataset; and develop
MAD-Fact, a debate-based multi-agent verification system. We introduce a fact
importance hierarchy to capture the varying significance of claims in long-form
texts. Experiments on two benchmarks show that larger LLMs generally maintain
higher factual consistency, while domestic models excel on Chinese content. Our
work provides a structured framework for evaluating and enhancing factual
reliability in long-form LLM outputs, guiding their safe deployment in
sensitive domains.

*Michael Hardy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用基于句子嵌入的定制LLM来客观评估教学质量，这些模型在课堂观察中达到甚至超过人类评分水平，并与教师增值测量相关，但尚未完全泛化到单个项目级别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 教育中需要客观可扩展的教学质量测量方法，传统通用LLM在处理复杂的课堂观察工具时存在困难，需要更适合长文本解释性内容的架构。

Method: 使用基于句子级嵌入的定制LLM，系统评估五种不同句子嵌入，采用数据高效训练机制防止过拟合，分析注释上下文窗口。

Result: 专业模型达到人类水平甚至超人类表现，专家评分相关性超过0.65，优于平均人类评分相关性；更先进的模型将更多分数变异归因于课程级特征而非孤立话语；聚合模型分数与教师增值测量相关。

Conclusion: 建立了一种可行且强大的AI驱动教学测量新方法，为教育者发展提供可扩展、可靠且有效的反馈路径，但模型尚未实现完全泛化。

Abstract: Objective and scalable measurement of teaching quality is a persistent
challenge in education. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential,
general-purpose models have struggled to reliably apply complex, authentic
classroom observation instruments. This paper uses custom LLMs built on
sentence-level embeddings, an architecture better suited for the long-form,
interpretive nature of classroom transcripts than conventional subword
tokenization. We systematically evaluate five different sentence embeddings
under a data-efficient training regime designed to prevent overfitting. Our
results demonstrate that these specialized models can achieve human-level and
even super-human performance with expert human ratings above 0.65 and
surpassing the average human-human rater correlation. Further, through analysis
of annotation context windows, we find that more advanced models-those better
aligned with human judgments-attribute a larger share of score variation to
lesson-level features rather than isolated utterances, challenging the
sufficiency of single-turn annotation paradigms. Finally, to assess external
validity, we find that aggregate model scores align with teacher value-added
measures, indicating they are capturing features relevant to student learning.
However, this trend does not hold at the individual item level, suggesting that
while the models learn useful signals, they have not yet achieved full
generalization. This work establishes a viable and powerful new methodology for
AI-driven instructional measurement, offering a path toward providing scalable,
reliable, and valid feedback for educator development.

TL;DR: 对最先进的transformer、状态空间和混合大语言模型在基于知识的上下文学习任务上进行深入评估，发现不同架构的LLM在任务表现上可能相似，但内部机制存在差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深入理解不同架构大语言模型在上下文学习中的内部机制差异，特别是transformer、状态空间和混合模型在知识型任务中的表现。

Method: 结合行为探测和基于干预的方法，分析函数向量在自注意力和Mamba层中的分布，比较不同架构模型在参数知识检索和上下文知识理解中的表现。

Result: 发现负责上下文学习的函数向量主要位于自注意力和Mamba层，Mamba2可能使用不同于函数向量的机制进行上下文学习。函数向量对涉及参数知识检索的上下文学习更重要，但对上下文知识理解不重要。

Conclusion: 不同架构的LLM在任务表现上可能相似但内部机制不同，需要结合行为和机制分析来全面理解LLM能力，为跨架构和任务类型的理解提供了更细致的视角。

Abstract: We perform in-depth evaluations of in-context learning (ICL) on
state-of-the-art transformer, state-space, and hybrid large language models
over two categories of knowledge-based ICL tasks. Using a combination of
behavioral probing and intervention-based methods, we have discovered that,
while LLMs of different architectures can behave similarly in task performance,
their internals could remain different. We discover that function vectors (FVs)
responsible for ICL are primarily located in the self-attention and Mamba
layers, and speculate that Mamba2 uses a different mechanism from FVs to
perform ICL. FVs are more important for ICL involving parametric knowledge
retrieval, but not for contextual knowledge understanding. Our work contributes
to a more nuanced understanding across architectures and task types.
Methodologically, our approach also highlights the importance of combining both
behavioural and mechanistic analyses to investigate LLM capabilities.

TL;DR: TIR-Judge是一个端到端的强化学习框架，用于训练集成代码执行器的LLM评估器，在多个基准测试中超越了基于推理的评估器，并在零蒸馏训练下达到与蒸馏变体相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM评估器仅依赖文本推理，无法验证复杂约束或进行精确计算，而工具集成推理在其他任务中表现出色，因此需要开发能够集成工具进行精确评估的LLM评估器。

Method: 基于三个原则构建的端到端RL框架：跨可验证和不可验证领域的多样化训练、灵活的评估格式（点对点、成对、列表式）、无需蒸馏的迭代强化学习。

Result: 在7个公共基准测试中，TIR-Judge在点对点评估上超越强推理评估器6.4%，成对评估上超越7.7%，列表式评估性能与Claude-Opus-4相当（仅8B参数）。TIR-Judge-Zero在零蒸馏训练下达到与蒸馏变体相当的性能。

Conclusion: 工具增强的评估器可以通过迭代强化学习自我进化，无需蒸馏轨迹，证明了TIR-Judge框架的有效性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used as judges to evaluate response
quality, providing a scalable alternative to human evaluation. However, most
LLM judges operate solely on intrinsic text-based reasoning, limiting their
ability to verify complex constraints or perform accurate computation.
Motivated by the success of tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) in numerous tasks,
we propose TIR-Judge, an end-to-end RL framework for training LLM judges that
integrates a code executor for precise evaluation. TIR-Judge is built on three
principles: (i) diverse training across verifiable and non-verifiable domains,
(ii) flexible judgment formats (pointwise, pairwise, listwise), and (iii)
iterative RL that bootstraps directly from the initial model without
distillation. On seven public benchmarks, TIR-Judge surpasses strong
reasoning-based judges by up to 6.4% (pointwise) and 7.7% (pairwise), and
achieves listwise performance comparable to Claude-Opus-4 despite having only
8B parameters. Remarkably, TIR-Judge-Zero - trained entirely without distilled
judge trajectories, matches the performance of distilled variants,
demonstrating that tool-augmented judges can self-evolve through iterative
reinforcement learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Multi-head attention (MHA) has become the cornerstone of modern large
language models, enhancing representational capacity through parallel attention
heads. However, increasing the number of heads inherently weakens individual
head capacity, and existing attention mechanisms - whether standard MHA or its
variants like grouped-query attention (GQA) and grouped-tied attention (GTA) -
simply concatenate outputs from isolated heads without strong interaction. To
address this limitation, we propose knocking-heads attention (KHA), which
enables attention heads to "knock" on each other - facilitating cross-head
feature-level interactions before the scaled dot-product attention. This is
achieved by applying a shared, diagonally-initialized projection matrix across
all heads. The diagonal initialization preserves head-specific specialization
at the start of training while allowing the model to progressively learn
integrated cross-head representations. KHA adds only minimal parameters and
FLOPs and can be seamlessly integrated into MHA, GQA, GTA, and other attention
variants. We validate KHA by training a 6.1B parameter MoE model (1.01B
activated) on 1T high-quality tokens. Compared to baseline attention
mechanisms, KHA brings superior and more stable training dynamics, achieving
better performance across downstream tasks.

TL;DR: QTT-RAG通过在mRAG中显式评估翻译质量（语义等价性、语法准确性和自然流畅性），并将评分作为元数据附加而不改变原始内容，从而在低资源语言环境下提升跨语言检索增强生成的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的mRAG方法在低资源语言环境下检索英文文档并翻译时，翻译质量差会降低响应生成性能。现有方法要么假设翻译质量足够好，要么使用重写方法导致事实扭曲和幻觉。

Method: 提出QTT-RAG方法，从三个维度评估翻译质量：语义等价性、语法准确性和自然流畅性，将这些评分作为元数据附加到文档中，不改变原始内容。

Result: 在两个开放域QA基准（XORQA、MKQA）上使用6个指令调优LLM（2.4B到14B参数）评估，涵盖韩语、芬兰语（低资源）和中文（高资源）。QTT-RAG优于基线方法CrossRAG和DKM-RAG，在保持事实完整性的同时让生成模型基于翻译可靠性做出明智决策。

Conclusion: QTT-RAG为低资源环境下有限母语文档的跨语言文档使用提供了实用且稳健的解决方案，在保持事实完整性的同时有效利用跨语言文档。

Abstract: Multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) often retrieves English
documents and translates them into the query language for low-resource
settings. However, poor translation quality degrades response generation
performance. Existing approaches either assume sufficient translation quality
or utilize the rewriting method, which introduces factual distortion and
hallucinations. To mitigate these problems, we propose Quality-Aware
Translation Tagging in mRAG (QTT-RAG), which explicitly evaluates translation
quality along three dimensions-semantic equivalence, grammatical accuracy, and
naturalness&fluency-and attach these scores as metadata without altering the
original content. We evaluate QTT-RAG against CrossRAG and DKM-RAG as baselines
in two open-domain QA benchmarks (XORQA, MKQA) using six instruction-tuned LLMs
ranging from 2.4B to 14B parameters, covering two low-resource languages
(Korean and Finnish) and one high-resource language (Chinese). QTT-RAG
outperforms the baselines by preserving factual integrity while enabling
generator models to make informed decisions based on translation reliability.
This approach allows for effective usage of cross-lingual documents in
low-resource settings with limited native language documents, offering a
practical and robust solution across multilingual domains.

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have highlighted the significant
benefits of multi-stage training, with a particular emphasis on the emergence
of mid-training as a vital stage that bridges pre-training and post-training.
Mid-training is distinguished by its use of intermediate data and computational
resources, systematically enhancing specified capabilities such as mathematics,
coding, reasoning, and long-context extension, while maintaining foundational
competencies. This survey provides a formal definition of mid-training for
large language models (LLMs) and investigates optimization frameworks that
encompass data curation, training strategies, and model architecture
optimization. We analyze mainstream model implementations in the context of
objective-driven interventions, illustrating how mid-training serves as a
distinct and critical stage in the progressive development of LLM capabilities.
By clarifying the unique contributions of mid-training, this survey offers a
comprehensive taxonomy and actionable insights, supporting future research and
innovation in the advancement of LLMs.

Motivation: 现有方法忽视了时间序列数据独特的统计特性和时间依赖性，需要专门设计来弥补这一差距。

Method: 提出四个专门的提示组件：全局领域提示、局部领域提示、统计提示和时间提示，结合原始时间序列嵌入，通过跨模态对齐模块生成统一表示。

Result: 在八个不同数据集上的实验显示，MAP4TS持续优于最先进的基于LLM的方法，且提示感知设计显著提升了性能稳定性。

Conclusion: 结构化提示与GPT-2骨干网络结合，在长期预测任务中优于更大的模型如LLaMA，证明了专门提示设计的有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances have investigated the use of pretrained large language models
(LLMs) for time-series forecasting by aligning numerical inputs with LLM
embedding spaces. However, existing multimodal approaches often overlook the
distinct statistical properties and temporal dependencies that are fundamental
to time-series data. To bridge this gap, we propose MAP4TS, a novel
Multi-Aspect Prompting Framework that explicitly incorporates classical
time-series analysis into the prompt design. Our framework introduces four
specialized prompt components: a Global Domain Prompt that conveys
dataset-level context, a Local Domain Prompt that encodes recent trends and
series-specific behaviors, and a pair of Statistical and Temporal Prompts that
embed handcrafted insights derived from autocorrelation (ACF), partial
autocorrelation (PACF), and Fourier analysis. Multi-Aspect Prompts are combined
with raw time-series embeddings and passed through a cross-modality alignment
module to produce unified representations, which are then processed by an LLM
and projected for final forecasting. Extensive experiments across eight diverse
datasets show that MAP4TS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based
methods. Our ablation studies further reveal that prompt-aware designs
significantly enhance performance stability and that GPT-2 backbones, when
paired with structured prompts, outperform larger models like LLaMA in
long-term forecasting tasks.

Method: 研究了两种层次组织方法，在三个大语言模型上进行测试，使用自动指标、基于模型的指标和领域专家评估（偏好、可理解性、清晰度、复杂性、相关性、覆盖度、事实性和连贯性）进行综合评估。

Result: 人类专家更偏好模型生成的摘要而非人工撰写的摘要。层次化方法在保持信息事实性、覆盖度和连贯性的同时，提高了人类对摘要的偏好。GPT-4的模拟判断与人类判断在更客观的评估维度上具有更高一致性。

Conclusion: 层次结构可以提高医学摘要的清晰度，同时保持内容覆盖度，为提高生成摘要的人类偏好提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Medical multi-document summarization (MDS) is a complex task that requires
effectively managing cross-document relationships. This paper investigates
whether incorporating hierarchical structures in the inputs of MDS can improve
a model's ability to organize and contextualize information across documents
compared to traditional flat summarization methods. We investigate two ways of
incorporating hierarchical organization across three large language models
(LLMs), and conduct comprehensive evaluations of the resulting summaries using
automated metrics, model-based metrics, and domain expert evaluation of
preference, understandability, clarity, complexity, relevance, coverage,
factuality, and coherence. Our results show that human experts prefer
model-generated summaries over human-written summaries. Hierarchical approaches
generally preserve factuality, coverage, and coherence of information, while
also increasing human preference for summaries. Additionally, we examine
whether simulated judgments from GPT-4 align with human judgments, finding
higher agreement along more objective evaluation facets. Our findings
demonstrate that hierarchical structures can improve the clarity of medical
summaries generated by models while maintaining content coverage, providing a
practical way to improve human preference for generated summaries.

*Tomáš Sourada,Jana Straková*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种紧凑的单模型多语言词形变化方法，在73种语言上联合训练，性能优于单语言基线，简化了部署需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决缺乏开源、通用、多语言形态变化系统的问题，特别是能够处理未见词汇的系统。

Method: 使用单模型在73种语言数据上联合训练，引入基于频率加权和词干分离的训练-开发-测试重采样方法。

Result: 模型轻量、对未见词汇鲁棒，在大多数语言中优于单语言基线模型。

Conclusion: 证明了多语言建模在词形变化任务中的有效性，具有实际部署优势。

Abstract: We present a compact, single-model approach to multilingual inflection, the
task of generating inflected word forms from base lemmas to express grammatical
categories. Our model, trained jointly on data from 73 languages, is
lightweight, robust to unseen words, and outperforms monolingual baselines in
most languages. This demonstrates the effectiveness of multilingual modeling
for inflection and highlights its practical benefits: simplifying deployment by
eliminating the need to manage and retrain dozens of separate monolingual
models. In addition to the standard SIGMORPHON shared task benchmarks, we
evaluate our monolingual and multilingual models on 73 Universal Dependencies
(UD) treebanks, extracting lemma-tag-form triples and their frequency counts.
To ensure realistic data splits, we introduce a novel frequency-weighted,
lemma-disjoint train-dev-test resampling procedure. Our work addresses the lack
of an open-source, general-purpose, multilingual morphological inflection
system capable of handling unseen words across a wide range of languages,
including Czech. All code is publicly released at:

*Shiwei Li,Xiandi Luo,Haozhao Wang,Xing Tang,Ziqiang Cui,Dugang Liu,Yuhua Li,Xiuqiang He,Ruixuan Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了TopLoRA方法，通过动态调整LoRA权重来学习token级别的输入-输出投影，解决了标准LoRA无法捕捉token特定信息的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准LoRA中所有输入token共享相同权重，限制了其捕捉token特定信息的能力，因为不同token之间存在固有的语义差异。

Method: TopLoRA将权重表示为BΣ_XA，其中A和B是低秩矩阵，Σ_X是从每个输入token生成的对角矩阵，动态调整LoRA权重以适应不同token。

Result: 在多个模型和数据集上的广泛实验表明，TopLoRA始终优于LoRA及其变体。

Conclusion: TopLoRA在不增加LoRA权重秩的情况下，通过学习token级别的LoRA权重实现了更细粒度的适应。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method
widely used in large language models (LLMs). LoRA essentially describes the
projection of an input space into a low-dimensional output space, with the
dimensionality determined by the LoRA rank. In standard LoRA, all input tokens
share the same weights and undergo an identical input-output projection. This
limits LoRA's ability to capture token-specific information due to the inherent
semantic differences among tokens. To address this limitation, we propose
Token-wise Projected Low-Rank Adaptation (TopLoRA), which dynamically adjusts
LoRA weights according to the input token, thereby learning token-wise
input-output projections in an end-to-end manner. Formally, the weights of
TopLoRA can be expressed as $B\Sigma_X A$, where $A$ and $B$ are low-rank
matrices (as in standard LoRA), and $\Sigma_X$ is a diagonal matrix generated
from each input token $X$. Notably, TopLoRA does not increase the rank of LoRA
weights but achieves more granular adaptation by learning token-wise LoRA
weights (i.e., token-wise input-output projections). Extensive experiments
across multiple models and datasets demonstrate that TopLoRA consistently
outperforms LoRA and its variants. The code is available at

*Tomáš Sourada,Jana Straková*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文探索在形态屈折任务中引入语料库频率信息，通过频率加权的训练-开发-测试分割、结合类型准确率和标记准确率的评估方法，以及频率感知训练策略，在43种语言中的26种上优于均匀采样。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统形态屈折方法缺乏对词频分布的考虑，而实际应用中用户输入反映了自然文本的真实频率分布，因此需要将语料库频率信息整合到系统开发中。

Method: 采用三种频率整合方法：(i) 词干不相交且频率加重的训练-开发-测试分割；(ii) 结合类型准确率和标记准确率的评估；(iii) 频率感知训练，在训练过程中显式纳入词频信息。

Result: 频率感知训练在43种语言中的26种上表现优于均匀采样，表明频率信息对形态屈折任务具有积极影响。

Conclusion: 将语料库频率信息整合到形态屈折任务的系统开发中能更好地反映实际应用场景，频率感知训练策略在多数语言中有效提升性能。

Abstract: The traditional approach to morphological inflection (the task of modifying a
base word (lemma) to express grammatical categories) has been, for decades, to
consider lexical entries of lemma-tag-form triples uniformly, lacking any
information about their frequency distribution. However, in production
deployment, one might expect the user inputs to reflect a real-world
distribution of frequencies in natural texts. With future deployment in mind,
we explore the incorporation of corpus frequency information into the task of
morphological inflection along three key dimensions during system development:
(i) for train-dev-test split, we combine a lemma-disjoint approach, which
evaluates the model's generalization capabilities, with a frequency-weighted
strategy to better reflect the realistic distribution of items across different
frequency bands in training and test sets; (ii) for evaluation, we complement
the standard type accuracy (often referred to simply as accuracy), which treats
all items equally regardless of frequency, with token accuracy, which assigns
greater weight to frequent words and better approximates performance on running
text; (iii) for training data sampling, we introduce a method novel in the
context of inflection, frequency-aware training, which explicitly incorporates
word frequency into the sampling process. We show that frequency-aware training
outperforms uniform sampling in 26 out of 43 languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ENTP框架通过神经符号方法从低质量数据中提取价值，通过符号净化和神经重建增强SFT数据质量，仅使用低质量数据就能超越传统数据选择方法和完整数据集的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SFT方法只关注高质量数据，忽视了低质量数据中的有价值信号，且依赖不完美的质量过滤器。

Method: 提出ENTP框架，包含符号模块（基于统计先验识别和修剪噪声样本）和神经组件（利用潜在表示和模型知识合成增强的指令-响应对）。

Result: 仅使用低质量数据构建的ENTP增强数据集在五个指令跟随基准测试中超越了13个现有数据选择基线，甚至优于在完整原始数据集（约30万样本）上的微调。

Conclusion: 低质量数据具有未开发的潜力，智能净化和合成对于高效的指令对齐至关重要。

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) adapts pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs)
to domain-specific instructions by training on a carefully curated subset of
high-quality instruction-response pairs, typically drawn from a larger dataset
that often contains many low-quality or noisy samples. However, existing
quality-first paradigms often overlook valuable signals in discarded
low-quality data and rely on imperfect quality filters. We introduce ENTP
(Enhancing low-quality SFT data via Neural-symbolic Text Purge-Mix), a
framework that revitalizes low-quality corpora through symbolic purification
and neural reconstruction. The symbolic module identifies and prunes noisy
samples based on statistical priors, while the neural component synthesizes
enriched instruction-response pairs by leveraging latent representations and
model knowledge. This neural-symbolic synergy enhances data informativeness and
diversity. Experiments show that ENTP-augmented datasets, constructed
exclusively from low-quality data, outperform 13 established data-selection
baselines across five instruction-following benchmarks, and even surpass
fine-tuning on the full original dataset (approximately 300K examples). Our
results highlight the untapped potential of low-quality data and underscore the
importance of intelligent purification and synthesis for efficient instruction
alignment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出双阶段精炼框架，将剧本创作分解为创意叙事生成和格式转换两个独立阶段，解决了LLM在剧本创作中同时处理创意和格式的困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM端到端生成剧本的方法往往只能模仿表面格式而缺乏深层结构完整性，因为单个模型难以同时掌握创意叙事构建和严格格式遵循这两种不同能力。

Method: 双阶段精炼框架：第一阶段将简要大纲转化为丰富的小说风格散文，第二阶段将叙事精炼为专业格式的剧本。通过混合数据合成解决训练数据稀缺问题。

Result: 专业编剧盲评显示，DSR相对于Gemini-2.5-Pro等强基线达到75%的胜率，达到人类水平表现的82.7%。

Conclusion: 分解生成架构结合定制化数据合成能够有效专业化LLM在复杂创意领域的应用。

Abstract: The screenplay serves as the foundation for television production, defining
narrative structure, character development, and dialogue. While Large Language
Models (LLMs) show great potential in creative writing, direct end-to-end
generation approaches often fail to produce well-crafted screenplays. We argue
this failure stems from forcing a single model to simultaneously master two
disparate capabilities: creative narrative construction and rigid format
adherence. The resulting outputs may mimic superficial style but lack the deep
structural integrity and storytelling substance required for professional use.
To enable LLMs to generate high-quality screenplays, we introduce Dual-Stage
Refinement (DSR), a decomposed framework that decouples creative narrative
generation from format conversion. The first stage transforms a brief outline
into rich, novel-style prose. The second stage refines this narrative into a
professionally formatted screenplay. This separation enables the model to
specialize in one distinct capability at each stage. A key challenge in
implementing DSR is the scarcity of paired outline-to-novel training data. We
address this through hybrid data synthesis: reverse synthesis deconstructs
existing screenplays into structured inputs, while forward synthesis leverages
these inputs to generate high-quality narrative texts as training targets.
Blind evaluations by professional screenwriters show that DSR achieves a 75%
win rate against strong baselines like Gemini-2.5-Pro and reaches 82.7% of
human-level performance. Our work demonstrates that decomposed generation
architecture with tailored data synthesis effectively specializes LLMs in
complex creative domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MATCH是一种新的无参考评估指标，使用对比学习生成代码和自然语言任务描述的嵌入，通过相似性评分来衡量生成代码实现任务的程度，比现有指标在功能正确性和人类偏好方面有更强的相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI代码生成日益普及，但准确评估生成代码与开发者意图的匹配程度仍具挑战性。传统评估方法如单元测试不可扩展且成本高，语法相似性指标无法捕捉代码功能，而CodeBERTScore等指标需要参考代码，但参考代码并非总是可用。

Method: MATCH使用对比学习生成代码和自然语言任务描述的有意义嵌入，实现相似性评分，反映生成代码实现任务的程度。

Result: MATCH在多种编程语言中，与功能正确性和人类偏好的相关性均强于现有指标。

Conclusion: MATCH填补了无参考评估的空白，提供了一种更有效的代码生成评估方法。

Abstract: AI-based code generation is increasingly prevalent, with GitHub Copilot
estimated to generate 46% of the code on GitHub. Accurately evaluating how well
generated code aligns with developer intent remains a critical challenge.
Traditional evaluation methods, such as unit tests, are often unscalable and
costly. Syntactic similarity metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE) fail to capture code
functionality, and metrics like CodeBERTScore require reference code, which is
not always available. To address the gap in reference-free evaluation, with few
alternatives such as ICE-Score, this paper introduces MATCH, a novel
reference-free metric. MATCH uses Contrastive Learning to generate meaningful
embeddings for code and natural language task descriptions, enabling similarity
scoring that reflects how well generated code implements the task. We show that
MATCH achieves stronger correlations with functional correctness and human
preference than existing metrics across multiple programming languages.

*Shuai Huang,Wenxuan Zhao,Jun Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SI-Bench是一个评估大语言模型社交智能的新基准，包含2,221个真实多轮对话，实验显示SOTA模型在复杂社交情境的过程推理上超越人类专家，但在回复质量上仍落后于人类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型发展出类人能力，它们越来越多地被部署为与人类互动的自主代理。然而，在现实复杂社交互动中评估其性能仍是一个重大挑战，现有数据集大多通过模拟代理间交互构建，无法捕捉真实人类对话中的语言风格和关系动态。

Method: 基于广泛的社会科学理论，SI-Bench收集了来自社交网络应用的2,221个真实多轮对话，并从中选取312个对话对8个主要模型进行手动标注。

Result: 实验表明，SOTA模型在复杂社交情境的过程推理上超越了人类专家，但在回复质量上仍落后于人类。此外，引入思维链推理可能会降低LLMs在社交对话任务中的表现。

Conclusion: SI-Bench为评估LLMs的社交智能提供了重要基准，揭示了当前模型在社交互动中的优势与不足，所有数据集已开源。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) develop anthropomorphic abilities, they are
increasingly being deployed as autonomous agents to interact with humans.
However, evaluating their performance in realistic and complex social
interactions remains a significant challenge. Most previous research built
datasets through simulated agent-to-agent interactions, which fails to capture
the authentic linguistic styles and relational dynamics found in real human
conversations. To address this gap, we introduce SI-Bench, a novel benchmark
designed to evaluate aspects of social intelligence in LLMs. Grounded in broad
social science theories, SI-Bench contains 2,221 authentic multi-turn dialogues
collected from a social networking application. We further selected a subset of
312 dialogues for manual annotation across 8 major models. The experiments show
that SOTA models have surpassed the human expert in process reasoning under
complex social situations, yet they still fall behind humans in reply quality.
Moreover, introducing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning may degrade the
performance of LLMs in social dialogue tasks. All datasets are openly available
at https://github.com/SI-Bench/SI-Bench.git.

TL;DR: 提出DREAM方法，使用预训练关系抽取模型从医学文本中提取药物关系并构建本体，然后用大语言模型验证提取结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 药物关系抽取对识别药物相互作用和预测副作用至关重要，但该领域缺乏专门数据集，需要采用迁移学习。

Method: 先使用训练好的关系抽取模型发现实体间关系，然后应用于医学文本语料库构建药物关系本体，最后用大语言模型验证提取的关系。

Result: 定量结果显示LLM对PubMed摘要子集中71%的提取关系表示同意，定性分析表明该方法能揭示医学领域的歧义性。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效提取药物关系，但医学领域的关系抽取仍面临挑战，特别是语义歧义问题。

Abstract: Relation extraction between drugs plays a crucial role in identifying drug
drug interactions and predicting side effects. The advancement of machine
learning methods in relation extraction, along with the development of large
medical text databases, has enabled the low cost extraction of such relations
compared to other approaches that typically require expert knowledge. However,
to the best of our knowledge, there are limited datasets specifically designed
for drug drug relation extraction currently available. Therefore, employing
transfer learning becomes necessary to apply machine learning methods in this
domain. In this study, we propose DREAM, a method that first employs a trained
relation extraction model to discover relations between entities and then
applies this model to a corpus of medical texts to construct an ontology of
drug relationships. The extracted relations are subsequently validated using a
large language model. Quantitative results indicate that the LLM agreed with 71
of the relations extracted from a subset of PubMed abstracts. Furthermore, our
qualitative analysis indicates that this approach can uncover ambiguities in
the medical domain, highlighting the challenges inherent in relation extraction
in this field.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种句子级别的过程奖励模型(PRM)，用于检测大型视觉语言模型生成的放射学报告中的临床幻觉，该模型在弱监督下训练，能有效提升报告质量并具有良好的跨模型泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的放射学报告自动生成模型经常产生临床关键性幻觉，存在严重风险，而现有的幻觉检测方法缺乏句子级粒度或对不同的LVLM生成器缺乏鲁棒泛化能力。

Method: 采用句子级别的过程奖励模型(PRM)，基于临床上下文和先前文本预测每个生成句子的真实性，在MIMIC-CXR数据集上使用弱监督标签进行微调。

Result: 轻量级0.5B参数PRM在多个指标上优于现有验证技术，在未见过的LVLM上表现出强泛化能力，能有效过滤低质量报告并提升临床指标。

Conclusion: 轻量级、上下文感知的PRM为临床LVLM提供了模型无关的安全层，无需访问内部激活状态即可有效检测和减轻幻觉风险。

Abstract: Automating radiology report generation with Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) holds great potential, yet these models often produce clinically
critical hallucinations, posing serious risks. Existing hallucination detection
methods frequently lack the necessary sentence-level granularity or robust
generalization across different LVLM generators. We introduce a novel approach:
a sentence-level Process Reward Model (PRM) adapted for this vision-language
task. Our PRM predicts the factual correctness of each generated sentence,
conditioned on clinical context and preceding text. When fine-tuned on
MIMIC-CXR with weakly-supervised labels, a lightweight 0.5B-parameter PRM
outperforms existing verification techniques, demonstrating, for instance,
relative improvements of 7.5% in Matthews Correlation Coefficient and 1.8% in
AUROC over strong white-box baselines on outputs from one LVLM. Unlike methods
reliant on internal model states, our PRM demonstrates strong generalization to
an unseen LVLM. We further show its practical utility: PRM scores effectively
filter low-quality reports, improving F1-CheXbert scores by 4.5% (when
discarding the worst 10% of reports). Moreover, when guiding a novel weighted
best-of-N selection process on the MIMIC-CXR test set, our PRM show relative
improvements in clinical metrics of 7.4% for F1-CheXbert and 0.6% for
BERTScore. These results demonstrate that a lightweight, context-aware PRM
provides a model-agnostic safety layer for clinical LVLMs without access to
internal activations

Motivation: 研究方言变异对自动语音识别的影响，传统研究依赖标准形式，而方言ASR被视为微调任务。

Method: 开发Ben-10语料库，从语言学和数据驱动角度分析，比较零样本和微调设置下的表现。

Result: 语音基础模型在方言ASR中表现严重不佳，所有深度学习方法都难以建模方言变异数据，但方言特定训练能改善问题。

Conclusion: 方言变异对ASR构成重大挑战，Ben-10数据集可作为资源受限条件下ASR建模的分布外资源。

Abstract: Conventional research on speech recognition modeling relies on the canonical
form for most low-resource languages while automatic speech recognition (ASR)
for regional dialects is treated as a fine-tuning task. To investigate the
effects of dialectal variations on ASR we develop a 78-hour annotated Bengali
Speech-to-Text (STT) corpus named Ben-10. Investigation from linguistic and
data-driven perspectives shows that speech foundation models struggle heavily
in regional dialect ASR, both in zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We observe
that all deep learning methods struggle to model speech data under dialectal
variations but dialect specific model training alleviates the issue. Our
dataset also serves as a out of-distribution (OOD) resource for ASR modeling
under constrained resources in ASR algorithms. The dataset and code developed
for this project are publicly available

Motivation: 解决现有阿拉伯语言模型依赖英语翻译数据导致的文化真实性不足、意图检测失败和检索增强生成效果差的问题，同时应对"效用差距危机"——即事实正确的答案无法解决用户核心需求的问题。

Method: 使用专有阿拉伯OCR引擎数字化历史手稿，扩展真实阿拉伯语源训练集；采用深度语言工程框架；核心创新是实用闭合架构，优先考虑清晰度和决定性指导；结合深度遗产专业化和多学科专家模块。

Result: 模型能够精确理解古典文本、当代写作和地区方言，掌握阿拉伯语的意义和雄辩性，在文化保存和通用知识领域均表现出强大性能。

Conclusion: Mubeen从信息存储库转变为决定性指南，确保文化真实性和准确性，与沙特2030愿景保持一致，解决了阿拉伯语言AI模型的关键挑战。

Abstract: Mubeen is a proprietary Arabic language model developed by MASARAT SA,
optimized for deep understanding of Arabic linguistics, Islamic studies, and
cultural heritage. Trained on an extensive collection of authentic Arabic
sources significantly expanded by digitizing historical manuscripts via a
proprietary Arabic OCR engine, the model incorporates seminal scholarly works
in linguistics, jurisprudence, hadith, and Quranic exegesis, alongside
thousands of academic theses and peer-reviewed research papers. Conditioned
through a deep linguistic engineering framework, Mubeen masters not just the
meaning but the eloquence of Arabic, enabling precise understanding across
classical texts, contemporary writing, and regional dialects with focus on
comprehending user intent and delivering accurate, contextually relevant
responses. Unlike other Arabic models relying on translated English data that
often fail in intent detection or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), Mubeen
uses native Arabic sources to ensure cultural authenticity and accuracy. Its
core innovation is the Practical Closure Architecture, designed to solve the
"Utility Gap Crisis" where factually correct answers fail to resolve users'
core needs, forcing them into frustrating cycles of re-prompting. By
prioritizing clarity and decisive guidance, Mubeen transforms from an
information repository into a decisive guide, aligning with Saudi Vision 2030.
The model's architecture combines deep heritage specialization with
multi-disciplinary expert modules, enabling robust performance across both
cultural preservation and general knowledge domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLM在传统编程任务上表现出色，但在视觉导向的编码任务中生成的代码美观度较差，需要专门的方法来提升代码美学质量。

Method: 构建AesCode-358K指令调优数据集；提出多代理奖励反馈系统评估可执行性、静态美学和交互美学；开发GRPO-AR算法进行功能和美学联合优化；创建OpenDesign基准评估代码美学。

Result: 在AesCode-358K上进行监督微调并结合强化学习显著提升了OpenDesign基准上的性能，并在PandasPlotBench等现有基准上也有改进。AesCoder-4B超越了GPT-4o和GPT-4.1，性能可与480B-685B参数的大型开源模型相媲美。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了LLM生成代码的美学质量，证明了代码美学优化的可行性和重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become valuable assistants for developers
in code-related tasks. While LLMs excel at traditional programming tasks such
as code generation and bug fixing, they struggle with visually-oriented coding
tasks, often producing suboptimal aesthetics. In this paper, we introduce a new
pipeline to enhance the aesthetic quality of LLM-generated code. We first
construct AesCode-358K, a large-scale instruction-tuning dataset focused on
code aesthetics. Next, we propose agentic reward feedback, a multi-agent system
that evaluates executability, static aesthetics, and interactive aesthetics.
Building on this, we develop GRPO-AR, which integrates these signals into the
GRPO algorithm for joint optimization of functionality and code aesthetics.
Finally, we develop OpenDesign, a benchmark for assessing code aesthetics.
Experimental results show that combining supervised fine-tuning on AesCode-358K
with reinforcement learning using agentic reward feedback significantly
improves performance on OpenDesign and also enhances results on existing
benchmarks such as PandasPlotBench. Notably, our AesCoder-4B surpasses GPT-4o
and GPT-4.1, and achieves performance comparable to large open-source models
with 480B-685B parameters, underscoring the effectiveness of our approach.

Motivation: 解决自然多参与者对话中极端语音重叠（高达100%）和高度碎片化对话轮次的识别问题，通过多模态方法提升在嘈杂环境下的语音识别和说话者聚类准确性。

Method: 使用音频、视觉和上下文线索联合转录每个说话者的语音，并将其聚类到各自的对话中。数据收集基于非脚本化的自然群组聊天录音。

Abstract: We introduce the task of Multi-Modal Context-Aware Recognition (MCoRec) in
the ninth CHiME Challenge, which addresses the cocktail-party problem of
overlapping conversations in a single-room setting using audio, visual, and
contextual cues. MCoRec captures natural multi-party conversations where the
recordings focus on unscripted, casual group chats, leading to extreme speech
overlap of up to 100% and highly fragmented conversational turns. The task
requires systems to answer the question "Who speaks when, what, and with whom?"
by jointly transcribing each speaker's speech and clustering them into their
respective conversations from audio-visual recordings. Audio-only baselines
exceed 100% word error rate, whereas incorporating visual cues yields
substantial 50% improvements, highlighting the importance of multi-modality. In
this manuscript, we present the motivation behind the task, outline the data
collection process, and report the baseline systems developed for the MCoRec.

### [308] [DCMM-SQL: Automated Data-Centric Pipeline and Multi-Model Collaboration Training for Text-to-SQL Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23284)
*Yuanzhen Xie,Liu Ye,Jiqun Chu,Mochi Gao,Hehuan Liu,Yunzhi Tan,Bo Hu,Zang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种完全自动化的数据为中心的方法来改进文本到SQL任务，包括自适应数据修复和错误数据增强，以及多模型协作训练策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然基于代理的框架在文本到SQL任务中取得了显著改进，但数据为中心策略的影响却很少被探索。

Method: 设计了完全自动化的数据为中心流程，包括自适应数据修复（自动发现和修复训练数据集中的错误）和错误数据增强（扩散和增强初始训练模型预测的错误数据）。同时提出多模型协作训练方案，训练具有不同增强数据的多个模型，使其具备不同能力并相互补充。

Result: 实验结果表明，数据为中心流程和多模型交互迭代策略有效，在轻量级文本到SQL模型（70B以内）中取得了第一名。

Conclusion: 数据为中心的方法和多模型协作策略显著提升了文本到SQL任务的性能，证明了数据质量对模型性能的重要性。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL tasks have gained attractive improvements since the release of
ChatGPT. Among them, agent-based frameworks have been widely used in this
field. However, the impact of data-centric strategies on text-to-SQL tasks has
rarely been explored. In this paper, we systemically design a fully automated
data-centric pipeline for text-to-SQL tasks, including \emph{adaptive data
repair}, which can automatically find and fix errors in the training dataset;
and \emph{error data augmentation}, where we specifically diffuse and enhance
erroneous data predicted by the initially trained models. Meanwhile, we propose
a Multi-Model collaboration training schema, aiming to train multiple models
with different augmented data, enabling them to possess distinct capabilities
and work together to complement each other, because it has been found that the
capability of a single fine-tuned model is very limited. Furthermore, we
utilize an ensemble strategy to integrate the capabilities of multiple models
to solve a multiple-choice question, aiming to further improve the accuracy of
text-to-SQL tasks. The experiment results and ablation study have demonstrated
the effectiveness of data-centric pipeline and Multi-Model(MM) interactive
iterative strategies, achieving first place in lightweight text-to-SQL models
(within 70B).

*Mouhand Alkadri,Dania Desouki,Khloud Al Jallad*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了阿拉伯语儿童语音数据集Arabic Little STT，并在该数据集上评估了Whisper模型的性能，发现其对儿童语音识别效果较差，强调了儿童语音基准测试的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决阿拉伯语等低资源语言中儿童语音数据稀缺的问题，填补儿童特定语音语料库的空白。

Method: 创建了包含355个话语的Levantine阿拉伯语儿童语音数据集，并在8个Whisper变体上进行了系统评估，与成人阿拉伯语基准进行比较。

Result: 即使表现最好的Whisper Large_v3模型在儿童语音上的词错误率也高达0.66，远高于其在成人数据集上低于0.20的表现。

Conclusion: 强调了在ASR开发中需要专门的儿童语音基准测试和包容性训练数据，同时必须遵守严格的伦理和隐私框架来保护儿童敏感信息。

Abstract: The performance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems fundamentally depends
on high-quality training data. However, low-resource languages like Arabic
suffer from severe data scarcity. Moreover, the absence of child-specific
speech corpora is an essential gap that poses significant challenges. To
address this gap, we present our created dataset, Arabic Little STT, a dataset
of Levantine Arabic child speech recorded in classrooms, containing 355
utterances from 288 children (ages 6 - 13). We further conduct a systematic
assessment of Whisper, a state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR)
model, on this dataset and compare its performance with adult Arabic
benchmarks. Our evaluation across eight Whisper variants reveals that even the
best-performing model (Large_v3) struggles significantly, achieving a 0.66 word
error rate (WER) on child speech, starkly contrasting with its sub 0.20 WER on
adult datasets. These results align with other research on English speech.
Results highlight the critical need for dedicated child speech benchmarks and
inclusive training data in ASR development. Emphasizing that such data must be
governed by strict ethical and privacy frameworks to protect sensitive child
information. We hope that this study provides an initial step for future work
on equitable speech technologies for Arabic-speaking children. We hope that our
publicly available dataset enrich the children's demographic representation in
ASR datasets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdaSearch是一种新颖的块状搜索策略，通过自适应分配固定计算预算来优化LLM对齐，在无害性生成、情感控制和数学推理任务中相比Best-of-N基线提升超过10%的胜率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM对齐仍是一个关键挑战，推理时方法虽然比微调更灵活，但其均匀的计算努力往往导致次优的对齐效果。作者假设在多数对齐任务中，响应的初始标记更为关键。

Method: 提出AdaSearch块状搜索策略，使用采样调度自适应分配固定计算预算，将搜索努力集中在关键标记上。同时提出其树搜索对应方法AdaBeam，应用于顺序解码。

Result: 在八个LLM上的综合评估显示，AdaSearch优于强大的Best-of-N和微调基线，在无害性生成、受控情感生成和数学推理任务中，胜率相比Best-of-N提高超过10%。

Conclusion: AdaSearch通过自适应计算预算分配，有效提升了LLM对齐性能，证明了关注关键初始标记的策略优势。

Abstract: LLM alignment remains a critical challenge. Inference-time methods provide a
flexible alternative to fine-tuning, but their uniform computational effort
often yields suboptimal alignment. We hypothesize that for many alignment
tasks, the initial tokens of a response are disproportionately more critical.
To leverage this principle, we introduce AdaSearch, a novel blockwise search
strategy. It adaptively allocates a fixed computational budget using a sampling
schedule, focusing search effort on these critical tokens. We apply AdaSearch
to sequential decoding and introduce its tree-search counterpart, AdaBeam. Our
comprehensive evaluation across eight LLMs demonstrates that AdaSearch
outperforms strong Best-of-N and fine-tuning baselines. Specifically, win-rates
improve by over 10% for harmlessness generation, controlled sentiment
generation, and for mathematical reasoning tasks relative to Best-of-N.

*Siyuan Zheng,Pai Liu,Xi Chen,Jizheng Dong,Sihan Jia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了首个基于八字命理的人格推理问答数据集和BaZi-LLM系统，将符号推理与大语言模型结合，生成时间动态且细粒度的虚拟人格，相比主流LLM准确率提升30.3%-62.6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前虚拟角色生成方法严重依赖标注数据或手工制作的人格提示，难以规模化生成真实且上下文一致的人格。需要一种能生成文化背景丰富、上下文连贯的虚拟人格的方法。

Method: 创建了首个基于八字命理的人格推理问答数据集，将人类经验分类为财富、健康、亲属、职业和关系等维度。提出了BaZi-LLM系统，将符号推理与大语言模型集成。

Result: 相比DeepSeek-v3和GPT-5-mini等主流LLM，准确率提升30.3%-62.6%。当使用错误的八字信息时，模型准确率下降20%-45%，证明了文化基础符号-LLM集成的潜力。

Conclusion: 基于文化的符号推理与LLM集成在实现真实角色模拟方面具有显著潜力，能够生成时间动态且细粒度的虚拟人格。

Abstract: Human-like virtual characters are crucial for games, storytelling, and
virtual reality, yet current methods rely heavily on annotated data or
handcrafted persona prompts, making it difficult to scale up and generate
realistic, contextually coherent personas. We create the first QA dataset for
BaZi-based persona reasoning, where real human experiences categorized into
wealth, health, kinship, career, and relationships are represented as
life-event questions and answers. Furthermore, we propose the first BaZi-LLM
system that integrates symbolic reasoning with large language models to
generate temporally dynamic and fine-grained virtual personas. Compared with
mainstream LLMs such as DeepSeek-v3 and GPT-5-mini, our method achieves a
30.3%-62.6% accuracy improvement. In addition, when incorrect BaZi information
is used, our model's accuracy drops by 20%-45%, showing the potential of
culturally grounded symbolic-LLM integration for realistic character
simulation.

TL;DR: LightKGG是一个使用小型语言模型从文本中高效提取知识图谱的框架，通过上下文集成图提取和拓扑增强关系推理两个关键技术，在低资源环境下实现准确的知识图谱构建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量知识图谱的稀缺是下游AI应用的关键瓶颈，现有提取方法依赖错误率高的模式匹配或计算密集型大语言模型，限制了在低资源环境中的可访问性。

Method: 采用两个关键技术：上下文集成图提取将上下文信息与节点和边集成到统一图结构中；拓扑增强关系推理利用提取图的固有拓扑结构高效推断关系。

Result: 该框架能够在最小硬件要求下实现准确的知识图谱构建，填补了自动化知识提取与实际部署场景之间的差距。

Conclusion: LightKGG通过优化小型语言模型在结构化NLP任务中的效率，为低资源环境下的知识图谱提取提供了科学严谨的方法。

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality knowledge graphs (KGs) remains a critical
bottleneck for downstream AI applications, as existing extraction methods rely
heavily on error-prone pattern-matching techniques or resource-intensive large
language models (LLMs). While recent tools leverage LLMs to generate KGs, their
computational demands limit accessibility for low-resource environments. Our
paper introduces LightKGG, a novel framework that enables efficient KG
extraction from textual data using small-scale language models (SLMs) through
two key technical innovations: (1) Context-integrated Graph extraction
integrates contextual information with nodes and edges into a unified graph
structure, reducing the reliance on complex semantic processing while
maintaining more key information; (2) Topology-enhanced relationship inference
leverages the inherent topology of the extracted graph to efficiently infer
relationships, enabling relationship discovery without relying on complex
language understanding capabilities of LLMs. By enabling accurate KG
construction with minimal hardware requirements, this work bridges the gap
between automated knowledge extraction and practical deployment scenarios while
introducing scientifically rigorous methods for optimizing SLM efficiency in
structured NLP tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个评估大语言模型预测AI对就业影响能力的基准，结合了美国部门级职位发布数据和全球AI采用导致的职业变化预测数据，通过多种提示策略评估LLMs的预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工智能正在重塑劳动力市场，但缺乏系统预测AI对就业影响的工具。现有研究表明LLMs能够提取情感、总结经济报告和模拟预测者行为，但很少评估其在前瞻性劳动力预测中的应用。

Method: 构建了一个结合美国部门级高频职位发布指数和全球AI采用职业变化预测的基准数据集，采用时间分割避免信息泄露，使用任务支架、角色驱动和混合等多种提示策略评估不同模型家族。

Result: 结构化任务提示能持续提高预测稳定性，角色提示在短期趋势上有优势，但性能在不同部门和预测时间跨度上差异显著，需要领域感知提示和严格评估协议。

Conclusion: 该基准支持未来劳动力预测、提示设计和基于LLM的经济推理研究，为研究AI作为劳动力市场预测工具的局限性和机会提供了可复现的测试平台。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is reshaping labor markets, yet we lack tools to
systematically forecast its effects on employment. This paper introduces a
benchmark for evaluating how well large language models (LLMs) can anticipate
changes in job demand, especially in occupations affected by AI. Existing
research has shown that LLMs can extract sentiment, summarize economic reports,
and emulate forecaster behavior, but little work has assessed their use for
forward-looking labor prediction. Our benchmark combines two complementary
datasets: a high-frequency index of sector-level job postings in the United
States, and a global dataset of projected occupational changes due to AI
adoption. We format these data into forecasting tasks with clear temporal
splits, minimizing the risk of information leakage. We then evaluate LLMs using
multiple prompting strategies, comparing task-scaffolded, persona-driven, and
hybrid approaches across model families. We assess both quantitative accuracy
and qualitative consistency over time. Results show that structured task
prompts consistently improve forecast stability, while persona prompts offer
advantages on short-term trends. However, performance varies significantly
across sectors and horizons, highlighting the need for domain-aware prompting
and rigorous evaluation protocols. By releasing our benchmark, we aim to
support future research on labor forecasting, prompt design, and LLM-based
economic reasoning. This work contributes to a growing body of research on how
LLMs interact with real-world economic data, and provides a reproducible
testbed for studying the limits and opportunities of AI as a forecasting tool
in the context of labor markets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究比较了基于规则的方法和大型语言模型在检测气候相关文本中宗教语言的效果，发现基于规则的方法比LLMs识别出更多宗教语言，揭示了宗教语言检测的方法论挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究宗教语言在当代话语中的持续存在，特别是在环境行动主义和气候变化辩论等看似世俗的领域中，探索如何计算检测宗教语言。

Method: 采用双重方法：基于生态神学文献构建宗教术语层次树的规则模型，以及在零样本设置下运行的大型语言模型，使用超过88万句的数据集进行比较分析。

Result: 基于规则的方法始终比LLMs标记更多句子为宗教语言，两种方法在宗教语言检测上存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了计算检测宗教语言的方法论挑战，以及宗教语言是否应仅由词汇定义还是由上下文意义定义这一更广泛的张力，为宗教研究中的数字方法做出贡献。

Abstract: Religious language continues to permeate contemporary discourse, even in
ostensibly secular domains such as environmental activism and climate change
debates. This paper investigates how explicit and implicit forms of religious
language appear in climate-related texts produced by secular and religious
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). We introduce a dual methodological
approach: a rule-based model using a hierarchical tree of religious terms
derived from ecotheology literature, and large language models (LLMs) operating
in a zero-shot setting. Using a dataset of more than 880,000 sentences, we
compare how these methods detect religious language and analyze points of
agreement and divergence. The results show that the rule-based method
consistently labels more sentences as religious than LLMs. These findings
highlight not only the methodological challenges of computationally detecting
religious language but also the broader tension over whether religious language
should be defined by vocabulary alone or by contextual meaning. This study
contributes to digital methods in religious studies by demonstrating both the
potential and the limitations of approaches for analyzing how the sacred
persists in climate discourse.

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合专家(MoE)框架，结合了xLSTM、增强线性模型、PatchTST和minGRU等最先进的时间序列预测模型，通过基于Transformer的门控网络集成这些互补模型，在标准基准测试中超越了所有现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对时间序列预测领域Transformer模型有效性的争议，以及数据更倾向于近期历史且可能受不可预测事件影响的特点，需要开发一个能够整合多种互补模型的强大框架。

Method: 使用基于Transformer的混合专家(MoE)门控网络，集成xLSTM、增强线性模型、PatchTST、minGRU等最先进的多样化时间序列预测模型。

Result: 在标准基准测试中超越了所有现有的时间序列预测模型，包括最新的基于MoE框架的方法。

Conclusion: 提出的混合专家框架通过整合多种互补模型，在时间序列预测任务中取得了最先进的性能，证明了集成多样化模型的有效性。

Abstract: The immense success of the Transformer architecture
  in Natural Language Processing has led to its adoption in Time Se ries
Forecasting (TSF), where superior performance has been shown.
  However, a recent important paper questioned their effectiveness by
  demonstrating that a simple single layer linear model outperforms
  Transformer-based models. This was soon shown to be not as valid,
  by a better transformer-based model termed PatchTST. More re cently, TimeLLM
demonstrated even better results by repurposing a
  Large Language Model (LLM) for the TSF domain. Again, a follow
  up paper challenged this by demonstrating that removing the LLM
  component or replacing it with a basic attention layer in fact yields
  better performance. One of the challenges in forecasting is the fact
  that TSF data favors the more recent past, and is sometimes subject
  to unpredictable events. Based upon these recent insights in TSF, we
  propose a strong Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework. Our method
  combines the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models including xLSTM, en hanced
Linear, PatchTST, and minGRU, among others. This set of
  complimentary and diverse models for TSF are integrated in a Trans former
based MoE gating network. Our proposed model outperforms
  all existing TSF models on standard benchmarks, surpassing even the
  latest approaches based on MoE frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励模型主要关注文本和图像模态，对视频、音频等其他模态支持有限；且基于固定二元偏好对的训练无法捕捉个性化偏好的复杂性。

Method: 构建了Omni-RewardBench基准测试、Omni-RewardData数据集，并开发了包含判别式和生成式奖励模型的Omni-RewardModel。

Result: 在Omni-RewardBench及其他广泛使用的奖励建模基准测试中取得了强劲性能。

Conclusion: Omni-Reward是迈向支持自由形式偏好的通用多模态奖励建模的重要一步。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in aligning AI behaviors with human
preferences, yet they face two fundamental challenges: (1) Modality Imbalance,
where most RMs are mainly focused on text and image modalities, offering
limited support for video, audio, and other modalities; and (2) Preference
Rigidity, where training on fixed binary preference pairs fails to capture the
complexity and diversity of personalized preferences. To address the above
challenges, we propose Omni-Reward, a step toward generalist omni-modal reward
modeling with support for free-form preferences, consisting of: (1) Evaluation:
We introduce Omni-RewardBench, the first omni-modal RM benchmark with free-form
preferences, covering nine tasks across five modalities including text, image,
video, audio, and 3D; (2) Data: We construct Omni-RewardData, a multimodal
preference dataset comprising 248K general preference pairs and 69K
instruction-tuning pairs for training generalist omni-modal RMs; (3) Model: We
propose Omni-RewardModel, which includes both discriminative and generative
RMs, and achieves strong performance on Omni-RewardBench as well as other
widely used reward modeling benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注单轮场景下的置信度，而对复杂多轮交互中的置信度研究有限。本文旨在探索LLM搜索代理是否能在长序列动作后通过语言化置信度分数传达自信

Method: 在开源代理模型上进行实验，发现模型在高置信度时任务准确率更高。基于此提出测试时缩放(TTS)方法，使用置信度分数确定答案质量，鼓励模型在达到满意置信度水平前重试

Result: 模型在高置信度时表现出更高的任务准确率，在低置信度时准确率接近零。提出的TTS方法显著减少了token消耗，同时与基线固定预算TTS方法相比表现出竞争力

Conclusion: LLM搜索代理能够通过语言化置信度分数传达自信，基于置信度的测试时缩放方法在减少资源消耗的同时保持了性能竞争力

Abstract: Confidence in LLMs is a useful indicator of model uncertainty and answer
reliability. Existing work mainly focused on single-turn scenarios, while
research on confidence in complex multi-turn interactions is limited. In this
paper, we investigate whether LLM-based search agents have the ability to
communicate their own confidence through verbalized confidence scores after
long sequences of actions, a significantly more challenging task compared to
outputting confidence in a single interaction. Experimenting on open-source
agentic models, we first find that models exhibit much higher task accuracy at
high confidence while having near-zero accuracy when confidence is low. Based
on this observation, we propose Test-Time Scaling (TTS) methods that use
confidence scores to determine answer quality, encourage the model to try again
until reaching a satisfactory confidence level. Results show that our proposed
methods significantly reduce token consumption while demonstrating competitive
performance compared to baseline fixed budget TTS methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SEC文件和财报电话会议记录中的财务叙述对投资者很重要，但长度、专业术语和微妙语言使得细粒度分析困难，现有方法需要大量标注数据。

Method: 从10-K年报和财报电话会议记录中提取句子，使用ChatGPT-o3-pro模型进行立场标注（积极、消极、中性），并系统评估现代大语言模型在零样本、少样本和思维链提示策略下的表现。

Result: 少样本结合思维链提示策略表现最佳，优于监督基线方法，且大语言模型在SEC和财报电话会议数据集上的表现存在差异。

Conclusion: 研究证明了在不需大量标注数据的情况下，利用大语言模型进行财务领域目标特定立场检测的可行性。

Abstract: Financial narratives from U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
filing reports and quarterly earnings call transcripts (ECTs) are very
important for investors, auditors, and regulators. However, their length,
financial jargon, and nuanced language make fine-grained analysis difficult.
Prior sentiment analysis in the financial domain required a large, expensive
labeled dataset, making the sentence-level stance towards specific financial
targets challenging. In this work, we introduce a sentence-level corpus for
stance detection focused on three core financial metrics: debt, earnings per
share (EPS), and sales. The sentences were extracted from Form 10-K annual
reports and ECTs, and labeled for stance (positive, negative, neutral) using
the advanced ChatGPT-o3-pro model under rigorous human validation. Using this
corpus, we conduct a systematic evaluation of modern large language models
(LLMs) using zero-shot, few-shot, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting
strategies. Our results show that few-shot with CoT prompting performs best
compared to supervised baselines, and LLMs' performance varies across the SEC
and ECT datasets. Our findings highlight the practical viability of leveraging
LLMs for target-specific stance in the financial domain without requiring
extensive labeled data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准大多忽视了数学辅导所需的诊断学生困难和逐步指导的能力，需要专门评估AI模型的数学辅导技能。

Method: 构建包含685个问题的MMTutorBench基准，每个问题配有特定评分标准，评估三个任务：洞察发现、操作制定和操作执行，使用基于评分标准的LLM-as-a-Judge方法进行可靠评估。

Result: 发现专有模型与开源模型之间存在明显性能差距，与人类导师相比还有很大提升空间；OCR流水线会降低辅导质量，少样本提示效果有限，基于评分标准的LLM评估方法可靠性高。

Conclusion: MMTutorBench既展示了AI数学辅导的难度，也证明了其在诊断AI辅导能力方面的价值，有助于推进AI辅导技术的发展。

Abstract: Effective math tutoring requires not only solving problems but also
diagnosing students' difficulties and guiding them step by step. While
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise, existing benchmarks
largely overlook these tutoring skills. We introduce MMTutorBench, the first
benchmark for AI math tutoring, consisting of 685 problems built around
pedagogically significant key-steps. Each problem is paired with
problem-specific rubrics that enable fine-grained evaluation across six
dimensions, and structured into three tasks-Insight Discovery, Operation
Formulation, and Operation Execution. We evaluate 12 leading MLLMs and find
clear performance gaps between proprietary and open-source systems, substantial
room compared to human tutors, and consistent trends across input variants: OCR
pipelines degrade tutoring quality, few-shot prompting yields limited gains,
and our rubric-based LLM-as-a-Judge proves highly reliable. These results
highlight both the difficulty and diagnostic value of MMTutorBench for
advancing AI tutoring.

Conclusion: M4FC数据集解决了现有数据集的局限性，为多模态事实核查研究提供了更全面和多样化的资源。

Abstract: Existing real-world datasets for multimodal automated fact-checking have
multiple limitations: they contain few instances, focus on only one or two
languages and tasks, suffer from evidence leakage, or depend on external sets
of news articles for sourcing true claims. To address these shortcomings, we
introduce M4FC, a new real-world dataset comprising 4,982 images paired with
6,980 claims. The images, verified by professional fact-checkers from 22
organizations, represent diverse cultural and geographic contexts. Each claim
is available in one or two out of ten languages. M4FC spans six multimodal
fact-checking tasks: visual claim extraction, claimant intent prediction, fake

TL;DR: 提出了IPQA基准，用于评估个性化问答中的核心意图识别能力，发现现有模型在识别用户优先意图方面存在困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准仅评估回答质量或检索性能，缺乏对意图识别能力的直接衡量，而理解用户优先意图对于生成满足个性化信息需求的回答至关重要。

Method: 基于满意理论，从用户答案选择行为中推导核心意图，通过系统过滤、LLM标注和严格质量控制构建多领域数据集。

Result: 实验表明现有语言模型在个性化情境下难以识别核心意图，性能随问题复杂度增加而下降。

Conclusion: 核心意图识别是PQA的关键挑战，IPQA基准将促进该方向的研究发展。

Abstract: Intent identification serves as the foundation for generating appropriate
responses in personalized question answering (PQA). However, existing
benchmarks evaluate only response quality or retrieval performance without
directly measuring intent identification capabilities. This gap is critical
because without understanding which intents users prioritize, systems cannot
generate responses satisfying individual information needs. To address this, we
introduce the concept of core intents: intents users prioritize when selecting
answers to satisfy their information needs. To evaluate these core intents, we
propose IPQA, a benchmark for core Intent identification in Personalized
Question Answering. Since users do not explicitly state their prioritized
intents, we derive core intents from observable behavior patterns in answer
selection, grounded in satisficing theory where users choose answers meeting
their acceptance thresholds. We construct a dataset with various domains
through systematic filtering, LLM-based annotation, and rigorous quality
control combining automated verification with human validation. Experimental
evaluations across state-of-the-art language models reveal that current systems
struggle with core intent identification in personalized contexts. Models fail
to identify core intents from user histories, with performance degrading as
question complexity increases. The code and dataset will be made publicly
available to facilitate future research in this direction.

### [322] [LimRank: Less is More for Reasoning-Intensive Information Reranking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23544)
*Tingyu Song,Yilun Zhao,Siyue Zhang,Chen Zhao,Arman Cohan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LIMRANK是一个使用少量合成数据训练的LLM重排序器，在推理密集型检索和指令跟随检索任务中表现优异，仅需传统方法5%的训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖大规模微调来适配LLM进行信息重排序，计算成本高昂。本文旨在证明现代LLM可以通过最小化高质量监督有效适配。

Method: 设计了LIMRANK-SYNTHESIZER管道生成多样化、具有挑战性的合成重排序示例，使用这些合成数据微调LIMRANK模型。

Result: LIMRANK在BRIGHT和FollowIR两个基准测试中取得有竞争力的性能，同时展示出在下游任务（科学文献搜索和知识密集型问题解决的检索增强生成）中的强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过高质量的合成数据，可以显著减少训练数据需求，同时保持重排序性能，证明了小规模高质量监督的有效性。

Abstract: Existing approaches typically rely on large-scale fine-tuning to adapt LLMs
for information reranking tasks, which is computationally expensive. In this
work, we demonstrate that modern LLMs can be effectively adapted using only
minimal, high-quality supervision. To enable this, we design
LIMRANK-SYNTHESIZER, a reusable and open-source pipeline for generating
diverse, challenging, and realistic reranking examples. Using this synthetic
data, we fine-tune our reranker model, LIMRANK. We evaluate LIMRANK on two
challenging benchmarks, i.e., BRIGHT for reasoning-intensive retrieval and
FollowIR for instruction-following retrieval. Our experiments demonstrate that
LIMRANK achieves competitive performance, while being trained on less than 5%
of the data typically used in prior work. Further ablation studies demonstrate
the effectiveness of LIMRANK-SYNTHESIZER and the strong generalization
capabilities of LIMRANK across downstream tasks, including scientific
literature search and retrieval-augmented generation for knowledge-intensive
problem solving.

### [323] [Hope Speech Detection in Social Media English Corpora: Performance of Traditional and Transformer Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23585)
*Luis Ramos,Hiram Calvo,Olga Kolesnikova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估了传统机器学习模型和微调transformer在希望语音检测任务上的表现，发现transformer模型在精度和召回率方面表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别希望语音已成为重要的NLP任务，需要在社交媒体平台上检测具有动机性和目标导向行为的表达。

Method: 使用传统机器学习模型（SVM、逻辑回归、朴素贝叶斯）和微调的transformer模型，在预先分割的希望语音数据集上进行评估。

Result: 传统模型中线性核SVM和逻辑回归的宏F1为0.78，RBF核SVM为0.77，朴素贝叶斯为0.75。Transformer模型表现更优，最佳模型加权精度0.82，加权召回率0.80，加权F1 0.79，宏F1 0.79，准确率0.80。

Conclusion: 虽然优化配置的传统机器学习模型仍然灵活，但transformer架构能够检测希望语音的微妙语义，在精度和召回率方面表现更好，表明大型transformer和LLM在小型数据集上可能表现更佳。

Abstract: The identification of hope speech has become a promised NLP task, considering
the need to detect motivational expressions of agency and goal-directed
behaviour on social media platforms. This proposal evaluates traditional
machine learning models and fine-tuned transformers for a previously split hope
speech dataset as train, development and test set. On development test, a
linear-kernel SVM and logistic regression both reached a macro-F1 of 0.78; SVM
with RBF kernel reached 0.77, and Na\"ive Bayes hit 0.75. Transformer models
delivered better results, the best model achieved weighted precision of 0.82,
weighted recall of 0.80, weighted F1 of 0.79, macro F1 of 0.79, and 0.80
accuracy. These results suggest that while optimally configured traditional
machine learning models remain agile, transformer architectures detect some
subtle semantics of hope to achieve higher precision and recall in hope speech
detection, suggesting that larges transformers and LLMs could perform better in
small datasets.

*Yizhu Jiao,Jiaqi Zeng,Julien Veron Vialard,Oleksii Kuchaiev,Jiawei Han,Olivier Delalleau*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了BR-RM（分支再思考奖励模型），一种两轮奖励建模方法，将"再思考"原则应用于奖励建模，通过自适应分支和针对性重读来减少判断扩散，提高对细微错误的敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统奖励模型将多个质量维度压缩为单次标量评分，导致注意力分散、判断扩散和浅层分析。受大语言模型"再思考"策略启发，希望将这种深思熟虑的方法引入奖励建模。

Method: 两轮方法：第一轮自适应分支，选择实例关键维度并生成证据寻求假设；第二轮分支条件重读，针对性测试假设并只关注最重要内容。使用GRPO风格强化学习训练，采用带严格格式检查的二元结果奖励。

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的奖励建模基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，涵盖多个领域。

Conclusion: BR-RM通过将一次性评分转换为聚焦的二次审视推理，减少了判断扩散，提高了对细微但重要错误的敏感性，同时保持实用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on thinking models that
externalize intermediate steps and allocate extra test-time compute, with
think-twice strategies showing that a deliberate second pass can elicit
stronger reasoning. In contrast, most reward models (RMs) still compress many
quality dimensions into a single scalar in one shot, a design that induces
judgment diffusion: attention spreads across evaluation criteria, yielding
diluted focus and shallow analysis. We introduce branch-and-rethink (BR-RM), a
two-turn RM that transfers the think-twice principle to reward modeling. Turn 1
performs adaptive branching, selecting a small set of instance-critical
dimensions (such as factuality and safety) and sketching concise,
evidence-seeking hypotheses. Turn 2 executes branch-conditioned rethinking, a
targeted reread that tests those hypotheses and scrutinizes only what matters
most. We train with GRPO-style reinforcement learning over structured two-turn
traces using a simple binary outcome reward with strict format checks, making
the approach compatible with standard RLHF pipelines. By converting
all-at-oncescoringintofocused, second-lookreasoning,
BR-RMreducesjudgmentdiffusionandimproves sensitivity to subtle yet
consequential errors while remaining practical and scalable. Experimental
results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on
three challenging reward modeling benchmarks across diverse domains. The code
and the model will be released soon.

*Anant Pareek*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个综合性框架，将人工智能与计算心理学结合，通过端到端的开发流程建立了从预测建模到交互式心理分析的系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补孤立预测建模与交互式心理分析系统之间的空白，为计算心理学和人类-AI交互提供实用的研究模型。

Method: 采用多阶段方法：1) 在四个心理学数据集上建立基础性能基准；2) 微调transformer模型并解决工程挑战；3) 使用参数高效技术微调生成式大语言模型作为交互式"人格大脑"；4) 将预测和生成模型部署为微服务生态系统。

Result: 成功稳定了基于transformer的情感计算回归模型，在标准方法失败的情况下实现了有意义的预测性能，并开发了可复现的大规模AI研究方法。

Conclusion: 该工作展示了从研究到部署的完整流程，整合了预测分析与生成对话，为计算心理学和人类-AI交互的未来研究提供了实用模型。

Abstract: The confluence of Artificial Intelligence and Computational Psychology
presents an opportunity to model, understand, and interact with complex human
psychological states through computational means. This paper presents a
comprehensive, multi-faceted framework designed to bridge the gap between
isolated predictive modeling and an interactive system for psychological
analysis. The methodology encompasses a rigorous, end-to-end development
lifecycle. First, foundational performance benchmarks were established on four
diverse psychological datasets using classical machine learning techniques.
Second, state-of-the-art transformer models were fine-tuned, a process that
necessitated the development of effective solutions to overcome critical
engineering challenges, including the resolution of numerical instability in
regression tasks and the creation of a systematic workflow for conducting
large-scale training under severe resource constraints. Third, a generative
large language model (LLM) was fine-tuned using parameter-efficient techniques
to function as an interactive "Personality Brain." Finally, the entire suite of
predictive and generative models was architected and deployed as a robust,
scalable microservices ecosystem. Key findings include the successful
stabilization of transformer-based regression models for affective computing,
showing meaningful predictive performance where standard approaches failed, and
the development of a replicable methodology for democratizing large-scale AI
research. The significance of this work lies in its holistic approach,
demonstrating a complete research-to-deployment pipeline that integrates
predictive analysis with generative dialogue, thereby providing a practical
model for future research in computational psychology and human-AI interaction.

*Kentaro Ueda,Takehiro Takayanagi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PREFINE是一个无需参数更新或直接用户反馈的个性化故事生成框架，通过构建伪用户代理和用户特定评估标准来实现个性化生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统个性化方法依赖显式反馈或微调，存在用户负担、数据收集、计算成本和隐私等实际问题。

Method: 基于Critique-and-Refine范式，构建伪用户代理，生成用户特定评估标准，让代理基于这些标准进行批判和精炼。

Result: 在PerDOC和PerMPST数据集上，PREFINE在自动评估中获得了更高的胜率和显著分数，且不损害一般故事质量。

Conclusion: 该方法在故事生成之外，还有潜力应用于对话系统、教育和推荐等更广泛领域的个性化任务。

Abstract: While recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have improved the
quality of creative text generation, significant challenges remain in producing
personalized stories that reflect individual user preferences. Conventional
approaches rely on explicit feedback or fine-tuning, which presents practical
issues regarding user burden, data collection, computational costs, and
privacy. In this work, we propose PREFINE (Persona-and-Rubric Guided
Critique-and-Refine), a novel framework that extends the Critique-and-Refine
paradigm to personalization. PREFINE constructs a pseudo-user agent from a
user's interaction history and generates user-specific rubrics (evaluation
criteria). By having this agent critique and refine outputs on the user's
behalf based on these tailored rubrics, our method achieves personalized
generation without requiring parameter updates or direct user feedback. We
conducted a comprehensive evaluation on the PerDOC and PerMPST story datasets.
We designed three baseline methods and several model variants to verify the
contribution of each component of our framework. In automatic evaluations
(LLM-as-a-Judge), PREFINE achieved higher win rates and statistically
significant scores than the baselines, without compromising general story
quality. Analysis of the model variants confirmed that both the pseudo-user
agent and the user-specific rubrics are crucial for enhancing personalization
performance. Beyond story generation, our approach holds potential for enabling
efficient personalization in broader applications, such as dialogue systems,
education, and recommendation.

*Ryan Zhang,Herbert Woisetscläger*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SIGN（Schema-Induced Games for Naming）是一种命名游戏，通过轻量级结构引导多智能体形成一致的通信约定，相比无约束自然语言能实现更快收敛和高达5.8倍的协议达成率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实AI系统中，大型语言模型智能体在协作时可能形成不一致的通信约定，导致协调失败。协作编码和分布式规划等应用需要可靠、一致的通信，且系统扩展性是关键问题。

Method: 引入SIGN命名游戏，研究轻量级结构如何引导约定形成。比较模式诱导通信与无约束自然语言的性能差异。

Result: 模式诱导通信比无约束自然语言收敛更快，协议达成率最高可达5.8倍。

Conclusion: 最小化结构可以作为多智能体协调的简单控制机制，提高效率，其应用范围可扩展到命名游戏之外的领域。

Abstract: Real-world AI systems are tackling increasingly complex problems, often
through interactions among large language model (LLM) agents. When these agents
develop inconsistent conventions, coordination can break down. Applications
such as collaborative coding and distributed planning therefore require
reliable, consistent communication, and scalability is a central concern as
systems grow. We introduce Schema-Induced Games for Naming (SIGN), a naming
game that examines how lightweight structure can steer convention formation. We
compare schema-induced communication to unconstrained natural language and find
faster convergence with up to 5.8x higher agreement. These results suggest that
minimal structure can act as a simple control knob for efficient multi-agent
coordination, pointing toward broader applications beyond the naming game.

### [328] [Capability Ceilings in Autoregressive Language Models: Empirical Evidence from Knowledge-Intensive Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21866)
*Javier Marín*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现解码器自回归语言模型在知识密集型任务中存在能力天花板，参数规模扩大（70M-30B）对知识检索任务准确率提升微乎其微，而损失函数持续下降，显示指标不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究解码器自回归语言模型在不同任务类型上的缩放规律，特别是知识密集型任务与程序性任务的表现差异，为资源分配提供实证依据。

Method: 系统评估OPT和Pythia模型家族（70M-30B参数），分析损失函数与准确率的关系，并进行注意力干预实验观察模型敏感性。

Result: 知识检索任务准确率几乎无提升（MMLU数学基准稳定在19-20%），而损失下降31%；程序性任务则呈现传统缩放规律；注意力模式交换导致性能崩溃。

Conclusion: 对于OPT和Pythia架构的知识密集型应用，参数超过1-2B后准确率增益极小，损失改善与准确率提升存在脱节，这可能是架构固有约束或实现特定限制。

Abstract: We document empirical capability ceilings in decoder-only autoregressive
language models across knowledge-intensive tasks. Systematic evaluation of OPT
and Pythia model families (70M-30B parameters, spanning 240 times scaling)
reveals that knowledge retrieval tasks show negligible accuracy improvement
despite smooth loss reduction. On MMLU mathematics benchmarks, accuracy remains
flat at 19-20% (below 25% random chance) across all scales while cross-entropy
loss decreases by 31%. In contrast, procedural tasks like arithmetic show
conventional scaling where both metrics improve together. Attention
intervention experiments reveal high sensitivity to perturbation: swapping
attention patterns between models causes catastrophic performance collapse
(complete accuracy loss) rather than graceful degradation. These measurements
have immediate engineering implications: for knowledge-intensive applications
using OPT and Pythia architectures, parameter scaling beyond 1-2B offers
minimal accuracy gains despite continued loss improvement. Our findings
quantify capability-specific scaling failures in these model families to inform
resource allocation decisions. Whether these patterns reflect fundamental
constraints of decoder-only architectures or implementation-specific
limitations remains an open question requiring investigation across diverse
architectural approaches.

*Nannan Shi,Chuanyu Qin,Shipeng Song,Man Luo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 开发了GeoThoughts数据集和GeoThought-MLLM模型，通过包含详细推理链的训练数据显著提升了几何推理能力，在几何任务中超越了现有基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在视觉推理任务中几何问题性能下降的问题，主要挑战来自几何问题固有的复杂性（需要详细图像理解和多步推理）以及现有数据集在规模、多样性和明确推理轨迹方面的不足。

Method: 构建了包含6,243个样本的Geo-Thought-6K数据集及其增强版Geo-Thought-Augmented-10K（10,834个样本），每个样本包含视觉描述、逐步解决方案、明确推理链、反思步骤和最终答案。基于此开发了GeoThought-MLLM模型，在问题解决过程中生成详细思考过程。

Result: 模型在几何任务中超越了现有基准，训练使用Chain-of-Thought数据集提升了在领域内和领域外的几何推理能力。错误分析显示主要错误源于数学概念错误理解或空间判断错误，通过调用CoT可以纠正这些错误。

Conclusion: 通过提供包含详细推理链的训练数据，可以显著提升多模态模型在几何推理任务中的性能，证明了CoT方法在几何问题解决中的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities
in text-based mathematical problem solving; however, when adapted to visual
reasoning tasks, particularly geometric problem solving, their performance
substantially declines because geometric problems present unique challenges.
Specifically, these challenges stem from two key factors: first, the intrinsic
complexity of geometry requiring detailed image comprehension and multi-step
reasoning, and second, the limitations of existing datasets which lack
sufficient scale, diversity, and explicit reasoning traces, consequently
hindering effective model training. To address these challenges, we developed
the GeoThoughts dataset, a comprehensive geometric reasoning corpus with two
subsets: Geo-Thought-6K with 6,243 samples and its augmented version
Geo-Thought-Augmented-10K containing 10,834 samples. Each entry includes visual
descriptions, step-by-step solutions, explicit reasoning chains, reflection
steps, and final answers. Using this dataset, we developed GeoThought-MLLM, a
mathematical reasoning multimodal model that generates detailed thinking
processes during problem-solving. Our model outperforms existing benchmarks in
geometric tasks, demonstrating that training with our Chain-of-Thought dataset
improves geometric reasoning capabilities across both in-domain and
out-of-domain settings. Finally, we analyze failure cases and observe that
errors primarily arise from incorrect interpretation of mathematical concepts
or spatial misjudgment. By invoking CoT to correct these mistakes, the model
produces correct answers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索生成模型在组合优化问题中的应用潜力，特别是利用GFlowNets的计算可扩展性优势来解决传统精确方法难以处理的大规模问题。

Method: 使用轨迹平衡损失训练GFlowNets，按顺序构建解决方案：为生成树选择边、为路径选择节点、为旅行选择城市。

Result: 在多种规模的基准实例上，GFlowNets学会了找到最优解，生成的解与经典算法结果一致，训练收敛性取决于问题复杂度。

Conclusion: 生成模型可以通过学习策略解决组合优化问题，主要优势是计算可扩展性，在足够计算资源下可扩展到传统精确方法不可行的大规模问题。

Abstract: This work applies Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to three graph
optimization problems: the Traveling Salesperson Problem, Minimum Spanning
Tree, and Shortest Path. GFlowNets are generative models that learn to sample
solutions proportionally to a reward function. The models are trained using the
Trajectory Balance loss to build solutions sequentially, selecting edges for
spanning trees, nodes for paths, and cities for tours. Experiments on benchmark
instances of varying sizes show that GFlowNets learn to find optimal solutions.
For each problem type, multiple graph configurations with different numbers of
nodes were tested. The generated solutions match those from classical
algorithms (Dijkstra for shortest path, Kruskal for spanning trees, and exact
solvers for TSP). Training convergence depends on problem complexity, with the
number of episodes required for loss stabilization increasing as graph size
grows. Once training converges, the generated solutions match known optima from
classical algorithms across the tested instances. This work demonstrates that
generative models can solve combinatorial optimization problems through learned
policies. The main advantage of this learning-based approach is computational
scalability: while classical algorithms have fixed complexity per instance,
GFlowNets amortize computation through training. With sufficient computational
resources, the framework could potentially scale to larger problem instances
where classical exact methods become infeasible.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在弱于q^π可实现性但强于q^*可实现性的线性函数逼近框架下的计算复杂度问题，探索函数逼近自然出现的实际模型。

Method: 通过从δ-Max-3SAT和δ-Max-3SAT(b)问题归约到GLinear-κ-RL（贪婪策略）和SLinear-κ-RL（softmax策略）实例，建立计算复杂度下界。

Result: 证明了在参数化贪婪策略集下是NP难问题，在softmax策略集下（除非NP=RP）存在指数级下界（在特征向量维度上）。

Conclusion: 在部分q^π可实现性框架下，通常无法获得积极的计算结果，这与生成访问模型下的q^π可实现性形成对比。

Abstract: This paper investigates the computational complexity of reinforcement
learning in a novel linear function approximation regime, termed partial
$q^{\pi}$-realizability. In this framework, the objective is to learn an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy with respect to a predefined policy set $\Pi$, under
the assumption that all value functions for policies in $\Pi$ are linearly
realizable. The assumptions of this framework are weaker than those in
$q^{\pi}$-realizability but stronger than those in $q^*$-realizability,
providing a practical model where function approximation naturally arises. We
prove that learning an $\epsilon$-optimal policy in this setting is
computationally hard. Specifically, we establish NP-hardness under a
parameterized greedy policy set (argmax) and show that - unless NP = RP - an
exponential lower bound (in feature vector dimension) holds when the policy set
contains softmax policies, under the Randomized Exponential Time Hypothesis.
Our hardness results mirror those in $q^*$-realizability and suggest
computational difficulty persists even when $\Pi$ is expanded beyond the
optimal policy. To establish this, we reduce from two complexity problems,
$\delta$-Max-3SAT and $\delta$-Max-3SAT(b), to instances of GLinear-$\kappa$-RL
(greedy policy) and SLinear-$\kappa$-RL (softmax policy). Our findings indicate
that positive computational results are generally unattainable in partial
$q^{\pi}$-realizability, in contrast to $q^{\pi}$-realizability under a
generative access model.

*Josip Tomo Licardo,Nikola Tankovic*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了使用小型开源模型作为商业大语言模型在电子商务领域的高效替代方案，通过优化10亿参数的Llama 3.2模型，在保持99%准确率的同时大幅降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商用大语言模型在专业任务（如电子商务）中部署面临高计算成本、延迟和运营费用的问题，需要寻找更高效的替代方案。

Method: 采用量化低秩适应（QLoRA）对10亿参数Llama 3.2模型进行微调，使用合成数据集模拟真实用户查询，然后应用后训练量化技术创建GPU优化（GPTQ）和CPU优化（GGUF）版本。

Result: 专用1B模型达到99%准确率，与更大的GPT-4.1模型性能相当。4位GPTQ减少41%显存使用但推理速度下降82%，而GGUF格式在CPU上实现18倍推理吞吐量提升和超过90%内存消耗减少。

Conclusion: 经过适当优化的小型开源模型不仅是可行的，而且是领域特定应用更合适的替代方案，能以极低计算成本提供最先进的准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer state-of-the-art performance in natural
language understanding and generation tasks. However, the deployment of leading
commercial models for specialized tasks, such as e-commerce, is often hindered
by high computational costs, latency, and operational expenses. This paper
investigates the viability of smaller, open-weight models as a
resource-efficient alternative. We present a methodology for optimizing a
one-billion-parameter Llama 3.2 model for multilingual e-commerce intent
recognition. The model was fine-tuned using Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation
(QLoRA) on a synthetically generated dataset designed to mimic real-world user
queries. Subsequently, we applied post-training quantization techniques,
creating GPU-optimized (GPTQ) and CPU-optimized (GGUF) versions. Our results
demonstrate that the specialized 1B model achieves 99% accuracy, matching the
performance of the significantly larger GPT-4.1 model. A detailed performance
analysis revealed critical, hardware-dependent trade-offs: while 4-bit GPTQ
reduced VRAM usage by 41%, it paradoxically slowed inference by 82% on an older
GPU architecture (NVIDIA T4) due to dequantization overhead. Conversely, GGUF
formats on a CPU achieved a speedup of up to 18x in inference throughput and a
reduction of over 90% in RAM consumption compared to the FP16 baseline. We
conclude that small, properly optimized open-weight models are not just a
viable but a more suitable alternative for domain-specific applications,
offering state-of-the-art accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Distribution Shift Alignment (DSA)方法，通过两阶段微调对齐输出分布和分布偏移，显著提升LLM模拟调查响应的准确性，减少53.48-69.12%的真实数据需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本方法存在提示敏感性和低准确性问题，传统微调方法过度拟合训练集分布，无法产生比训练集更准确的结果，偏离了使用LLM模拟调查响应的初衷。

Method: DSA是一种两阶段微调方法，学习分布如何变化而不是拟合训练数据，对齐输出分布和不同背景下的分布偏移。

Result: 在五个公开调查数据集上，DSA始终优于其他方法，在准确性、鲁棒性和数据节省方面表现优异，减少53.48-69.12%的真实数据需求。

Conclusion: DSA能够提供比训练数据更接近真实分布的结果，证明了在调查模拟中的有效性和效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising way to simulate human survey
responses, potentially reducing the cost of large-scale data collection.
However, existing zero-shot methods suffer from prompt sensitivity and low
accuracy, while conventional fine-tuning approaches mostly fit the training set
distributions and struggle to produce results more accurate than the training
set itself, which deviates from the original goal of using LLMs to simulate
survey responses. Building on this observation, we introduce Distribution Shift
Alignment (DSA), a two-stage fine-tuning method that aligns both the output
distributions and the distribution shifts across different backgrounds. By
learning how these distributions change rather than fitting training data, DSA
can provide results substantially closer to the true distribution than the
training data. Empirically, DSA consistently outperforms other methods on five
public survey datasets. We further conduct a comprehensive comparison covering
accuracy, robustness, and data savings. DSA reduces the required real data by
53.48-69.12%, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency in survey
simulation.

Abstract: Math word problem (MWP) serves as a fundamental research topic in artificial
intelligence (AI) dating back to 1960s. This research aims to advance the
reasoning abilities of AI by mirroring the human-like cognitive intelligence.
The mainstream technological paradigm has evolved from the early rule-based
methods, to deep learning models, and is rapidly advancing towards large
language models. However, the field still lacks a systematic taxonomy for the
MWP survey along with a discussion of current development trends. Therefore, in
this paper, we aim to comprehensively review related research in MWP solving
through the lens of human cognition, to demonstrate how recent AI models are
advancing in simulating human cognitive abilities. Specifically, we summarize 5
crucial cognitive abilities for MWP solving, including Problem Understanding,
Logical Organization, Associative Memory, Critical Thinking, and Knowledge
Learning. Focused on these abilities, we review two mainstream MWP models in
recent 10 years: neural network solvers, and LLM based solvers, and discuss the
core human-like abilities they demonstrated in their intricate problem-solving
process. Moreover, we rerun all the representative MWP solvers and supplement
their performance on 5 mainstream benchmarks for a unified comparison. To the
best of our knowledge, this survey first comprehensively analyzes the
influential MWP research of the past decade from the perspective of human
reasoning cognition and provides an integrative overall comparison across
existing approaches. We hope it can inspire further research in AI reasoning.

### [335] [LightAgent: Mobile Agentic Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22009)
*Yangqin Jiang,Chao Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LightAgent是一个移动GUI代理基础模型，通过设备-云协作解决移动端模型性能不足的问题，在保持低成本的同时达到接近大模型的能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动GUI代理面临困境：真正在设备上运行的模型（4B或更小）性能不足，而有能力的模型（从7B开始）要么太大无法在移动端部署，要么成本过高（如仅限云端的闭源MLLM）

Method: 通过两阶段SFT->GRPO训练增强Qwen2.5-VL-3B模型，集成高效的长推理机制，默认在设备上执行，仅通过实时复杂度评估将具有挑战性的子任务升级到云端

Result: 在AndroidLab基准测试和多样化应用上的实验表明，LightAgent匹配或接近更大模型的能力，同时显著降低了云成本

Conclusion: LightAgent通过设备-云协作成功解决了移动GUI代理的性能与成本权衡问题，为移动平台提供了可行的代理基础模型解决方案

Abstract: With the advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), building
GUI agent systems has become an increasingly promising direction-especially for
mobile platforms, given their rich app ecosystems and intuitive touch
interactions. Yet mobile GUI agents face a critical dilemma: truly on-device
models (4B or smaller) lack sufficient performance, while capable models
(starting from 7B) are either too large for mobile deployment or prohibitively
costly (e.g., cloud-only closed-source MLLMs). To resolve this, we propose
LightAgent, a mobile agentic foundation model solution that leverages
device-cloud collaboration to tap the cost-efficiency of on-device models and
the high capability of cloud models, while avoiding their drawbacks.
Specifically, LightAgent enhances Qwen2.5-VL-3B via two-stage SFT->GRPO
training on synthetic GUI data for strong decision-making, integrates an
efficient long-reasoning mechanism to utilize historical interactions under
tight resources, and defaults to on-device execution-only escalating
challenging subtasks to the cloud via real-time complexity assessment.
Experiments on the online AndroidLab benchmark and diverse apps show LightAgent
matches or nears larger models, with a significant reduction in cloud costs.

*Rick Chen,Joseph Ternasky,Aaron Ontoyin Yin,Xianling Mu,Fuat Alican,Yigit Ihlamur*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-AR框架将LLM生成的启发式规则转化为概率规则，通过自动推理引擎进行高风险决策，在初创公司成功预测中达到59.5%精确度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然具备模式识别和推理能力，但其准确性不稳定，限制了在高风险决策应用中的采用。本文从风险投资角度研究如何基于创始人特质预测初创公司成功。

Method: 提出LLM-AR管道，受神经符号系统启发，将LLM生成的启发式规则提炼为概率规则，由ProbLog自动推理引擎执行。采用迭代策略进化循环，结合关联规则挖掘逐步优化预测规则。

Result: 在未见数据上，LLM-AR达到59.5%精确度和8.7%召回率，是随机基线精确度的5.9倍，同时所有决策路径都可供人工检查。

Conclusion: 该框架具有可解释性和可调性，展示了扩展到其他领域的潜力，为高风险决策应用提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can already identify patterns and reason
effectively, yet their variable accuracy hampers adoption in high-stakes
decision-making applications. In this paper, we study this issue from a venture
capital perspective by predicting idea-stage startup success based on founder
traits. (i) To build a reliable prediction model, we introduce LLM-AR, a
pipeline inspired by neural-symbolic systems that distils LLM-generated
heuristics into probabilistic rules executed by the ProbLog automated-reasoning
engine. (ii) An iterative policy-evolution loop incorporates association-rule
mining to progressively refine the prediction rules.
  On unseen folds, LLM-AR achieves 59.5% precision and 8.7% recall, 5.9x the
random baseline precision, while exposing every decision path for human
inspection. The framework is interpretable and tunable via hyperparameters,
showing promise to extend into other domains.

### [337] [Predictive Coding Enhances Meta-RL To Achieve Interpretable Bayes-Optimal Belief Representation Under Partial Observability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22039)
*Po-Chen Kuo,Han Hou,Will Dabney,Edgar Y. Walker*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 在部分可观测环境中，通过将自监督预测编码模块整合到元强化学习中，可以学习到更紧凑、可解释的贝叶斯最优信念状态表示，从而改善策略泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统元强化学习虽然能获得接近贝叶斯最优的策略，但往往无法学习到紧凑、可解释的贝叶斯最优信念状态，这种表示效率低下可能限制智能体的适应性和泛化能力。

Method: 受神经科学中预测编码和深度强化学习中辅助预测目标的启发，将自监督预测编码模块整合到元强化学习中。

Result: 在状态机模拟中，带预测模块的元强化学习始终生成比传统元强化学习更可解释的表示，能更好地逼近贝叶斯最优信念状态。在需要主动信息搜索的挑战性任务中，只有带预测模块的元强化学习能成功学习最优表示和策略。

Conclusion: 预测学习作为指导原则，在部分可观测环境中导航的智能体中进行有效表示学习具有重要作用。

Abstract: Learning a compact representation of history is critical for planning and
generalization in partially observable environments. While meta-reinforcement
learning (RL) agents can attain near Bayes-optimal policies, they often fail to
learn the compact, interpretable Bayes-optimal belief states. This
representational inefficiency potentially limits the agent's adaptability and
generalization capacity. Inspired by predictive coding in neuroscience--which
suggests that the brain predicts sensory inputs as a neural implementation of
Bayesian inference--and by auxiliary predictive objectives in deep RL, we
investigate whether integrating self-supervised predictive coding modules into
meta-RL can facilitate learning of Bayes-optimal representations. Through state
machine simulation, we show that meta-RL with predictive modules consistently
generates more interpretable representations that better approximate
Bayes-optimal belief states compared to conventional meta-RL across a wide
variety of tasks, even when both achieve optimal policies. In challenging tasks
requiring active information seeking, only meta-RL with predictive modules
successfully learns optimal representations and policies, whereas conventional
meta-RL struggles with inadequate representation learning. Finally, we
demonstrate that better representation learning leads to improved
generalization. Our results strongly suggest the role of predictive learning as
a guiding principle for effective representation learning in agents navigating
partial observability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 应用SpecC方法学对PCM-to-PWM转换器进行系统级硬件/软件协同设计，通过建模和架构探索找到满足实时约束且成本优化的HW/SW分区方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究系统级硬件/软件协同设计在中等复杂度设计中的价值，通过早期架构洞察和快速验证来获得可行的成本/性能权衡。

Method: 使用SpecC方法学对PCM-to-PWM转换器进行建模和架构探索，利用系统级估计和快速功能仿真评估不同的映射方案。

Result: 成功找到了满足实时约束的HW/SW分区方案，相比全硬件方案降低了估计成本，同时避免了在高性能处理器上纯软件实现的高昂开销。

Conclusion: 即使对于中等复杂度设计，系统级协同设计在提供早期架构洞察、快速验证和可行的成本/性能权衡方面具有重要价值。

Abstract: We present a case study applying the SpecC methodology within a system-level
hardware/software co-design flow to a PCM-to-PWM converter, the core of a
Class-D audio amplifier. The converter was modeled and explored with SpecC
methodology to derive an HW/SW partition. Using system-level estimates and fast
functional simulation, we evaluated mappings that meet real-time constraints
while reducing estimated cost of an all-hardware solution and avoiding the
expense of a purely software implementation on a high-end processor. Despite
the design's moderate complexity, the results underline the value of
system-level co-design for early architectural insight, rapid validation, and
actionable cost/performance trade-offs. [Original work from 2005; formatting

### [339] [Towards Error-Centric Intelligence II: Energy-Structured Causal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22050)
*Marcus Thomas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出从预测准确性转向因果解释的智能概念，引入能量结构化因果模型(ESCMs)，使模型内部结构可干预和操作，而不仅仅是黑箱预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器学习系统虽然预测性能优异，但缺乏因果透明性，无法对特定机制进行手术式编辑。需要重新定义智能为构建和修正解释的能力。

Method: 引入计算解释和能量结构化因果模型(ESCMs)，将机制表示为约束(能量函数或向量场)而非显式输入输出映射，通过局部手术实现干预。

Result: ESCMs在温和条件下恢复标准SCM语义，提供了因果推理的形式化语言，使内部结构在解释层面可操作。

Conclusion: 论文为追求理解而不仅仅是预测的系统提供了因果推理的形式化基础，将智能重新定义为在批评下构建解释的能力。

Abstract: Contemporary machine learning optimizes for predictive accuracy, yet systems
that achieve state of the art performance remain causally opaque: their
internal representations provide no principled handle for intervention. We can
retrain such models, but we cannot surgically edit specific mechanisms while
holding others fixed, because learned latent variables lack causal semantics.
We argue for a conceptual reorientation: intelligence is the ability to build
and refine explanations, falsifiable claims about manipulable structure that
specify what changes and what remains invariant under intervention.
Explanations subsume prediction but demand more: causal commitments that can be
independently tested and corrected at the level of mechanisms. We introduce
computational explanations, mappings from observations to intervention ready
causal accounts. We instantiate these explanations with Energy Structured
Causal Models (ESCMs), in which mechanisms are expressed as constraints (energy
functions or vector fields) rather than explicit input output maps, and
interventions act by local surgery on those constraints. This shift makes
internal structure manipulable at the level where explanations live: which
relations must hold, which can change, and what follows when they do. We
provide concrete instantiations of the structural-causal principles LAP and ICM
in the ESCM context, and also argue that empirical risk minimization
systematically produces fractured, entangled representations, a failure we
analyze as gauge ambiguity in encoder energy pairs. Finally, we show that under
mild conditions, ESCMs recover standard SCM semantics. Building on Part I's
principles (LAP, ICM, CAP) and its definition of intelligence as
explanation-building under criticism, this paper offers a formal language for
causal reasoning in systems that aspire to understand, not merely to predict.

*Abhijit Chatterjee,Niraj K. Jha,Jonathan D. Cohen,Thomas L. Griffiths,Hongjing Lu,Diana Marculescu,Ashiqur Rasul,Keshab K. Parhi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出下一代AI发展方向：从当前需要大量数据和能源的大语言模型转向轻量级、领域特定的多模态智能体，这些智能体能够在动态环境中进行推理、规划和决策，同时实现超过当前技术1000倍的能效提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI模型（特别是大语言模型）存在能耗巨大（GPT-4训练需50-60GWh）、产生幻觉问题，且无法在关键应用领域部署。相比之下，人脑仅消耗20W功率，需要开发更节能、更智能的AI系统。

Method: 提出开发轻量级领域特定多模态模型，这些模型能够：1）在动态环境中进行推理、规划和决策；2）利用实时数据和先验知识；3）持续学习并增强未来决策能力；4）实现比现有技术高1000倍的能效。

Result: 论文构建了未来AI系统的愿景，即从当前依赖海量数据训练的大模型转向能够思考和推理的能效领域特定智能体，这需要重新设计硬件架构。

Conclusion: 下一代AI将是从大模型向轻量级、领域特定智能体的演进，这些智能体能够在不确定性环境中进行高级推理，同时实现显著的能效提升，这需要硬件技术的根本性革新。

Abstract: The field of artificial intelligence (AI) has taken a tight hold on broad
aspects of society, industry, business, and governance in ways that dictate the
prosperity and might of the world's economies. The AI market size is projected
to grow from 189 billion USD in 2023 to 4.8 trillion USD by 2033. Currently, AI
is dominated by large language models that exhibit linguistic and visual
intelligence. However, training these models requires a massive amount of data
scraped from the web as well as large amounts of energy (50--60 GWh to train
GPT-4). Despite these costs, these models often hallucinate, a characteristic
that prevents them from being deployed in critical application domains. In
contrast, the human brain consumes only 20~W of power. What is needed is the
next level of AI evolution in which lightweight domain-specific multimodal
models with higher levels of intelligence can reason, plan, and make decisions
in dynamic environments with real-time data and prior knowledge, while learning
continuously and evolving in ways that enhance future decision-making
capability. This will define the next wave of AI, progressing from today's
large models, trained with vast amounts of data, to nimble energy-efficient
domain-specific agents that can reason and think in a world full of
uncertainty. To support such agents, hardware will need to be reimagined to
allow energy efficiencies greater than 1000x over the state of the art. Such a
vision of future AI systems is developed in this work.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该立场论文提出从脑机接口(BCI)向脑-智能体协作(BAC)的范式扩展，强调将智能体重新定义为主动协作伙伴而非被动脑信号处理器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前脑机接口面临信息传输率低、用户特定校准需求高等限制，阻碍了其广泛应用。虽然大型语言模型的整合有所进展，但部署智能AI仍面临技术和伦理挑战。

Method: 通过重新定义智能体角色，从被动脑信号数据处理转变为主动协作伙伴，并强调伦理数据处理、模型可靠性和稳健的人-智能体协作框架。

Result: 提出了从BCI到BAC的范式转变概念，为脑-智能体协作系统的发展提供了理论框架。

Conclusion: 需要关注伦理数据处理、模型可靠性和人-智能体协作框架，以确保脑-智能体协作系统的安全、可信和有效性。

Abstract: Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) offer a direct communication pathway between
the human brain and external devices, holding significant promise for
individuals with severe neurological impairments. However, their widespread
adoption is hindered by critical limitations, such as low information transfer
rates and extensive user-specific calibration. To overcome these challenges,
recent research has explored the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs),
extending the focus from simple command decoding to understanding complex
cognitive states. Despite these advancements, deploying agentic AI faces
technical hurdles and ethical concerns. Due to the lack of comprehensive
discussion on this emerging direction, this position paper argues that the
field is poised for a paradigm extension from BCI to Brain-Agent Collaboration
(BAC). We emphasize reframing agents as active and collaborative partners for
intelligent assistance rather than passive brain signal data processors,
demanding a focus on ethical data handling, model reliability, and a robust
human-agent collaboration framework to ensure these systems are safe,
trustworthy, and effective.

Motivation: 现有工作通常重复使用人类特质量表或临时角色，限制了行为真实性和领域相关性。

Conclusion: 该框架提高了AI系统评估的行为真实性和领域相关性，并将发布数据集和代码。

Abstract: AI psychometrics evaluates AI systems in roles that traditionally require
emotional judgment and ethical consideration. Prior work often reuses human
trait inventories (Big Five, \hexaco) or ad hoc personas, limiting behavioral
realism and domain relevance. We propose a framework that (1) uses situational
judgment tests (SJTs) from realistic scenarios to probe domain-specific
competencies; (2) integrates industrial-organizational and personality
psychology to design sophisticated personas which include behavioral and
psychological descriptors, life history, and social and emotional functions;
and (3) employs structured generation with population demographic priors and
memoir inspired narratives, encoded with Pydantic schemas. In a law enforcement
assistant case study, we construct a rich dataset of personas drawn across 8
persona archetypes and SJTs across 11 attributes, and analyze behaviors across
subpopulation and scenario slices. The dataset spans 8,500 personas, 4,000
SJTs, and 300,000 responses. We will release the dataset and all code to the

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种名为Dopamine的导数自由优化器，用于解决神经网络中的信用分配问题，通过权重扰动学习和自适应学习率策略，在减少计算和内存消耗的同时达到与梯度方法相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经网络中的信用分配问题，传统反向传播方法存在计算效率低、内存消耗大、权重传输和更新锁定等问题，需要更高效且神经生物学上更合理的解决方案。

Method: 采用神经强化学习启发的方法，开发Dopamine优化器，基于权重扰动学习，通过最小化期望结果与实际结果之间的奖励预测误差来调整学习率，实现自适应学习策略。

Result: 在多层感知器的XOR任务和循环神经网络的混沌时间序列预测中，Dopamine训练模型显示出加速收敛，优于标准权重扰动方法，性能与梯度算法相当，同时显著减少计算和内存消耗。

Conclusion: Dopamine优化器不仅找到了稳健的解决方案，性能与最先进的机器学习优化器相当，而且在神经生物学上更具合理性。

Abstract: Solving the synaptic Credit Assignment Problem(CAP) is central to learning in
both biological and artificial neural systems. Finding an optimal solution for
synaptic CAP means setting the synaptic weights that assign credit to each
neuron for influencing the final output and behavior of neural networks or
animals. Gradient-based methods solve this problem in artificial neural
networks using back-propagation, however, not in the most efficient way. For
instance, back-propagation requires a chain of top-down gradient computations.
This leads to an expensive optimization process in terms of computing power and
memory linked with well-known weight transport and update locking problems. To
address these shortcomings, we take a NeuroAI approach and draw inspiration
from neural Reinforcement Learning to develop a derivative-free optimizer for
training neural networks, Dopamine. Dopamine is developed for Weight
Perturbation (WP) learning that exploits stochastic updating of weights towards
optima. It achieves this by minimizing the regret, a form of Reward Prediction
Error (RPE) between the expected outcome from the perturbed model and the
actual outcome from the unperturbed model. We use this RPE to adjust the
learning rate in the network (i.e., creating an adaptive learning rate
strategy, similar to the role of dopamine in the brain). We tested the Dopamine
optimizer for training multi-layered perceptrons for XOR tasks, and recurrent
neural networks for chaotic time series forecasting. Dopamine-trained models
demonstrate accelerated convergence and outperform standard WP, and give
comparable performance to gradient-based algorithms, while consuming
significantly less computation and memory. Overall, the Dopamine optimizer not
only finds robust solutions and comparable performance to the state-of-the-art
Machine Learning optimizers but is also neurobiologically more plausible.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用固定步骤分解来生成变量、约束和目标，但由于运筹学问题具有高度复杂的数学结构，这种方法往往无法达到高性能。

Result: 在具有挑战性的基准测试中，OptiTree相比最先进方法实现了超过10%的建模准确率提升。

Conclusion: OptiTree通过自适应问题分解和层次化建模思路整合，有效提升了复杂运筹学问题的建模能力。

Abstract: Optimization modeling is one of the most crucial but technical parts of
operations research (OR). To automate the modeling process, existing works have
leveraged large language models (LLMs), prompting them to break down tasks into
steps for generating variables, constraints, and objectives. However, due to
the highly complex mathematical structures inherent in OR problems, standard
fixed-step decomposition often fails to achieve high performance. To address
this challenge, we introduce OptiTree, a novel tree search approach designed to
enhance modeling capabilities for complex problems through adaptive problem
decomposition into simpler subproblems. Specifically, we develop a modeling
tree that organizes a wide range of OR problems based on their hierarchical
problem taxonomy and complexity, with each node representing a problem category
and containing relevant high-level modeling thoughts. Given a problem to model,
we recurrently search the tree to identify a series of simpler subproblems and
synthesize the global modeling thoughts by adaptively integrating the
hierarchical thoughts. Experiments show that OptiTree significantly improves
the modeling accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art, achieving over 10\%
improvements on the challenging benchmarks. The code is released at
https://github.com/MIRALab-USTC/OptiTree/tree/main.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出PACR方法，通过模型内在的置信度奖励来加速强化学习训练，解决RLVR稀疏奖励导致的探索效率低下问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR的稀疏、基于结果的奖励无法为中间推理步骤提供指导，导致探索过程缓慢，需要更密集的奖励信号来加速训练。

Method: PACR方法基于模型对正确答案的置信度变化，构建密集的模型内在奖励，要求正确概率沿推理轨迹呈现上升趋势。

Result: PACR加速了探索过程，用更少的轨迹达到奖励饱和，并在多个基准测试中取得改进。

Conclusion: 密集的模型内在塑造信号可以使RLVR训练更有效和可靠。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has significantly
improved LLM reasoning, but its sparse, outcome-based reward provides no
guidance for intermediate steps, slowing exploration. We propose Progressively
Ascending Confidence Reward (PACR), a dense, model-intrinsic reward computed
directly from the model's evolving belief in the correct answer. PACR encodes
the inductive bias that, along a well-formed reasoning trajectory, the
probability of the ground-truth answer should have a generally ascending trend.
We provide empirical and theoretical analysis validating that such an inductive
bias constrains the exploration search space to regions richer in logically
sound reasoning. We demonstrate that PACR accelerates exploration, reaches
reward saturation with fewer trajectories, and yields improvements on multiple
benchmarks. Our results suggest that dense, model-intrinsic shaping signals can
make RLVR training more effective and reliable.

Abstract: Automatic Lyrics Transcription (ALT) for Vietnamese music presents unique
challenges due to its tonal complexity and dialectal variations, but remains
largely unexplored due to the lack of a dedicated dataset. Therefore, we
curated the first large-scale Vietnamese ALT dataset (VietLyrics), comprising
647 hours of songs with line-level aligned lyrics and metadata to address these
issues. Our evaluation of current ASRbased approaches reveal significant
limitations, including frequent transcription errors and hallucinations in
non-vocal segments. To improve performance, we fine-tuned Whisper models on the
VietLyrics dataset, achieving superior results compared to existing
multilingual ALT systems, including LyricWhiz. We publicly release VietLyrics
and our models, aiming to advance Vietnamese music computing research while
demonstrating the potential of this approach for ALT in low-resource language

Conclusion: 该方法能有效减少计算时间并保持解质量，同时还探索了量子启发优化技术的集成潜力，有望进一步加速大规模车辆路径任务。

Abstract: The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (CVRPTW) is a
fundamental NP-hard optimization problem in logistics. Solving large-scale
instances remains computationally challenging for exact solvers. This work
introduces a multilevel graph coarsening and refinement framework that
aggregates customers into meta-nodes using a spatio-temporal distance metric.
The reduced problem is solved with classical heuristics and subsequently
expanded back into the original space with feasibility corrections. Preliminary
experiments on Solomon benchmark instances show that the proposed method
reduces computation time while preserving or improving solution quality,
particularly with respect to capacity and time window constraints. The paper
also explores the integration of quantum-inspired optimization techniques,
highlighting their potential to further accelerate large-scale vehicle routing
tasks.

Result: LIFT LLM在风险预测准确性上显著优于基准模型，召回率提升26.7%，F1分数提升10.1%。模型生成的变量重要性排序与基准模型一致，且在不同数据采样条件下具有鲁棒性。模型还识别出经PERMANOVA检验验证的关键变量组合风险场景。

Abstract: This study proposes an interpretable prediction framework with
literature-informed fine-tuned (LIFT) LLMs for truck driving risk prediction.
The framework integrates an LLM-driven Inference Core that predicts and
explains truck driving risk, a Literature Processing Pipeline that filters and
summarizes domain-specific literature into a literature knowledge base, and a
Result Evaluator that evaluates the prediction performance as well as the
interpretability of the LIFT LLM. After fine-tuning on a real-world truck
driving risk dataset, the LIFT LLM achieved accurate risk prediction,
outperforming benchmark models by 26.7% in recall and 10.1% in F1-score.
Furthermore, guided by the literature knowledge base automatically constructed
from 299 domain papers, the LIFT LLM produced variable importance ranking
consistent with that derived from the benchmark model, while demonstrating
robustness in interpretation results to various data sampling conditions. The
LIFT LLM also identified potential risky scenarios by detecting key combination
of variables in truck driving risk, which were verified by PERMANOVA tests.
Finally, we demonstrated the contribution of the literature knowledge base and
the fine-tuning process in the interpretability of the LIFT LLM, and discussed
the potential of the LIFT LLM in data-driven knowledge discovery.

TL;DR: DynaSolidGeo是首个用于评估视觉语言模型真实空间推理能力的动态基准，专注于3D立体几何问题，通过半自动标注流程构建，包含503个专家策划的种子问题，可动态生成无限多样的多模态实例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学推理基准主要关注2D平面几何，依赖静态数据集易受数据污染和记忆影响，且仅评估最终答案而忽略推理过程，无法有效评估空间推理能力。

Method: 采用半自动标注流程构建动态基准，包含503个专家策划的种子问题，可动态生成多样化多模态实例，并引入基于专家标注推理链的过程评估来衡量逻辑有效性和因果一致性。

Result: 实验显示开源和闭源视觉语言模型存在巨大性能差距，在动态设置下性能严重下降，在需要高级空间智能的任务（如心理旋转和可视化）上表现较差。

Conclusion: DynaSolidGeo填补了3D立体几何推理评估的空白，揭示了当前视觉语言模型在空间推理方面的局限性，为未来研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Solid geometry problem solving demands spatial mathematical reasoning that
integrates spatial intelligence and symbolic reasoning. However, most existing
multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmarks focus primarily on 2D plane
geometry, rely on static datasets prone to data contamination and memorization,
and evaluate models solely by final answers, overlooking the reasoning process.
To address these limitations, we introduce DynaSolidGeo, the first dynamic
benchmark for evaluating genuine spatial reasoning in Vision-Language Models
(VLMs). Constructed through a semi-automatic annotation pipeline, DynaSolidGeo
contains 503 expert-curated seed questions that can, in principle, dynamically
generate an unbounded number of diverse multimodal text-visual instances.
Beyond answer accuracy, we incorporate process evaluation based on
expert-annotated reasoning chains to measure logical validity and causal
coherence. Experiments across representative open-source and closed-source VLMs
reveal large performance gaps, severe degradation in dynamic settings, and poor
performance on tasks requiring high-level spatial intelligence, such as mental
rotation and visualization. The code and dataset are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新评估大型语言模型在复杂推理任务上的真实能力，揭示现有基准测试的局限性，并开发更全面的评估数据集。

Method: 开发了Deep Reasoning Dataset (DeepRD)数据集，包含可扩展复杂度的图连接性和自然语言证明规划任务，用于评估模型在不同复杂度下的表现。

Result: 大型推理模型在足够复杂的推理问题上表现急剧下降，无法泛化，虽然大多数现实世界案例处于其成功范围内，但长尾分布暴露了重大失败风险。

Conclusion: 大型推理模型在短期内具有实用性，但需要开发能够超越训练分布复杂度的新方法来实现真正的泛化推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant progress in reasoning
tasks. However, recent studies show that transformers and LLMs fail
catastrophically once reasoning problems exceed modest complexity. We revisit
these findings through the lens of large reasoning models (LRMs) -- LLMs
fine-tuned with incentives for step-by-step argumentation and
self-verification. LRM performance on graph and reasoning benchmarks such as
NLGraph seem extraordinary, with some even claiming they are capable of
generalized reasoning and innovation in reasoning-intensive fields such as
mathematics, physics, medicine, and law. However, by more carefully scaling the
complexity of reasoning problems, we show existing benchmarks actually have
limited complexity. We develop a new dataset, the Deep Reasoning Dataset
(DeepRD), along with a generative process for producing unlimited examples of
scalable complexity. We use this dataset to evaluate model performance on graph
connectivity and natural language proof planning. We find that the performance
of LRMs drop abruptly at sufficient complexity and do not generalize. We also
relate our LRM results to the distributions of the complexities of large,
real-world knowledge graphs, interaction graphs, and proof datasets. We find
the majority of real-world examples fall inside the LRMs' success regime, yet
the long tails expose substantial failure potential. Our analysis highlights
the near-term utility of LRMs while underscoring the need for new methods that
generalize beyond the complexity of examples in the training distribution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大型推理模型(LRMs)涌现的推理能力是一个重要但困难的开放问题，这对于改进训练和理解模型鲁棒性具有重要应用价值。

Method: 采用无记忆有限状态机(FSM)公式化方法，将LRMs的层次推理动态近似为结构化、可解释的抽象表示，识别包括初始化、演绎、增强策略、不确定性估计、回溯和最终结论等离散推理状态。

Result: 通过将模型的思维链推理步骤标注为这些状态，可以将推理轨迹表示为状态图中的转换序列，FSM分析揭示了不同模型在推理方法上的差异、独特的推理模式和潜在缺陷。

Conclusion: FSM框架为分析和解释LLM推理提供了系统方法，能够可视化不同模型处理问题的方式，为评估和改进LLM推理提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities
when they generate step-by-step solutions, known as chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning. When trained to using chain-of-thought reasoning examples, the
resulting models (called Large Reasoning Models, or LRMs) appear to learn
hierarchical thinking strategies similar to those used by humans. However,
understanding LRMs emerging reasoning capabilities remains a difficult open
problem, with many potential important applications including improving
training and understanding robustness. In this paper, we adopt a memoryless
Finite State Machine formulation to approximate LRM's emerging hierarchical
reasoning dynamics as a structured, interpretable abstraction. We identify a
small set of discrete reasoning states including - initialization, deduction,
augmentation-strategy, uncertainty-estimation, backtracking, and
final-conclusion that capture the high-level states present in the model's
reasoning process. By annotating each step of a model's CoT with these states,
we can represent the reasoning trajectory as a transition sequence through the
state graph. This FSM formulation provides a systematic way to analyze,
interpret and visualize how different models approach problems. We describe the
FSM model, provide examples of CoT annotations under this scheme, and discuss
how it can shed light on differences between available models in their approach
to reasoning. Our results demonstrate that this FSM-based analysis reveals
distinct reasoning patterns and potential shortcomings, offering a new lens to
evaluate and improve LLM reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在代理环境中越来越多地部署，需要评估其在多轮、多方任务中的协作能力。现有基于RLHF训练的LLM代理倾向于忽略干预，这阻碍了团队共识的形成。

Method: 使用改进动作MDP框架分析标准AI代理的次优行为，提出ICR算法——一种伙伴感知学习算法，通过智能收集伙伴代理提供的干预信息来训练共识最优的协作代理。

Result: 在多个协作任务环境中的实验表明，ICR平均能更有效地促进共识收敛，并在任务中探索更多样化的解决方案。

Conclusion: ICR算法能够有效解决标准LLM代理忽略干预的问题，提升团队协作效率和共识形成能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly bring deployed in agentic
settings where they act as collaborators with humans. Therefore, it is
increasingly important to be able to evaluate their abilities to collaborate
effectively in multi-turn, multi-party tasks. In this paper, we build on the AI
alignment and safe interruptability literature to offer novel theoretical
insights on collaborative behavior between LLM-driven collaborator agents and
an intervention agent. Our goal is to learn an ideal partner-aware collaborator
that increases the group's common-ground (CG)-alignment on task-relevant
propositions-by intelligently collecting information provided in interventions
by a partner agent.We show how LLM agents trained using standard RLHF and
related approaches are naturally inclined to ignore possibly well-meaning
interventions, which makes increasing group common ground non-trivial in this
setting. We employ a two-player Modified-Action MDP to examine this suboptimal
behavior of standard AI agents, and propose Interruptible Collaborative
Roleplayer (ICR)-a novel partner-aware learning algorithm to train CG-optimal
collaborators. Experiments on multiple collaborative task environments show
that ICR, on average, is more capable of promoting successful CG convergence
and exploring more diverse solutions in such tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了OFFSIDE基准，用于评估多模态大语言模型在足球转会谣言方面的信息遗忘能力，揭示了当前方法在视觉谣言处理、遗忘效果和对抗攻击方面的显著脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态大语言模型的发展，数据隐私问题日益突出，机器遗忘成为关键需求。现有基准存在图像多样性不足、准确性问题和评估场景不充分等局限性。

Method: 构建了一个基于足球转会谣言的手动策划数据集，包含15.68K条记录和80名球员信息，提供四个测试集来评估遗忘效果、泛化性、实用性和鲁棒性，支持选择性遗忘和纠正性再学习等高级设置。

Result: 评估发现：单模态方法在多模态谣言上失败；遗忘效果主要由灾难性遗忘驱动；所有方法都难以处理视觉谣言；遗忘的谣言容易被恢复；所有方法都易受提示攻击。

Conclusion: 当前多模态遗忘方法存在严重脆弱性，需要开发更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) intensify concerns about
data privacy, making Machine Unlearning (MU), the selective removal of learned
information, a critical necessity. However, existing MU benchmarks for MLLMs
are limited by a lack of image diversity, potential inaccuracies, and
insufficient evaluation scenarios, which fail to capture the complexity of
real-world applications. To facilitate the development of MLLMs unlearning and
alleviate the aforementioned limitations, we introduce OFFSIDE, a novel
benchmark for evaluating misinformation unlearning in MLLMs based on football
transfer rumors. This manually curated dataset contains 15.68K records for 80
players, providing a comprehensive framework with four test sets to assess
forgetting efficacy, generalization, utility, and robustness. OFFSIDE supports
advanced settings like selective unlearning and corrective relearning, and
crucially, unimodal unlearning (forgetting only text data). Our extensive
evaluation of multiple baselines reveals key findings: (1) Unimodal methods
(erasing text-based knowledge) fail on multimodal rumors; (2) Unlearning
efficacy is largely driven by catastrophic forgetting; (3) All methods struggle
with "visual rumors" (rumors appear in the image); (4) The unlearned rumors can
be easily recovered and (5) All methods are vulnerable to prompt attacks. These
results expose significant vulnerabilities in current approaches, highlighting
the need for more robust multimodal unlearning solutions. The code is available

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ATOM是一个从非结构化文本构建和持续更新时序知识图谱的少样本可扩展方法，通过将文档分解为原子事实、采用双时间建模，显著提高了提取的完整性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态知识图谱构建忽略了现实世界数据的动态性和时效性，而现有的零/少样本方法存在多次运行不稳定和关键事实覆盖不完整的问题。

Method: 将输入文档分割为最小自包含的原子事实，构建原子时序知识图谱，采用区分信息观测时间和有效时间的双时间建模，并行合并原子图谱。

Result: 相比基线方法，ATOM实现了约18%的完整性提升、约17%的稳定性改善以及超过90%的延迟降低。

Conclusion: ATOM展示了动态时序知识图谱构建的强大可扩展潜力，能够有效适应数据的持续变化。

Abstract: In today's rapidly expanding data landscape, knowledge extraction from
unstructured text is vital for real-time analytics, temporal inference, and
dynamic memory frameworks. However, traditional static knowledge graph (KG)
construction often overlooks the dynamic and time-sensitive nature of
real-world data, limiting adaptability to continuous changes. Moreover, recent
zero- or few-shot approaches that avoid domain-specific fine-tuning or reliance
on prebuilt ontologies often suffer from instability across multiple runs, as
well as incomplete coverage of key facts. To address these challenges, we
introduce ATOM (AdapTive and OptiMized), a few-shot and scalable approach that
builds and continuously updates Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) from
unstructured texts. ATOM splits input documents into minimal, self-contained
"atomic" facts, improving extraction exhaustivity and stability. Then, it
constructs atomic TKGs from these facts while employing a dual-time modeling
that distinguishes when information is observed from when it is valid. The
resulting atomic TKGs are subsequently merged in parallel. Empirical
evaluations demonstrate that ATOM achieves ~18% higher exhaustivity, ~17%
better stability, and over 90% latency reduction compared to baseline methods,
demonstrating a strong scalability potential for dynamic TKG construction.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个分析上下文学习性能的新框架，研究预训练数据分布与查询任务分布不同时，如何通过适当构建的上下文将输出分布向查询任务分布转移，从而提高预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型预训练语言模型展现了强大的上下文学习能力，但理论上尚不清楚这种能力如何产生，特别是预训练过程和上下文构建等关键因素的确切作用。

Method: 构建了一个包含单层transformer的简单示例，然后将发现扩展到更一般情况，推导出ICL性能、上下文长度以及预训练与查询任务分布之间KL散度的精确关系，并通过实验验证理论结果。

Result: 当预训练数据分布与查询任务分布不同时，适当构建的上下文可以以可量化的方式将输出分布向查询任务分布转移，从而在查询主题上实现准确预测。

Conclusion: 论文建立了一个理论框架来分析ICL性能，揭示了上下文在弥合预训练分布与任务分布差异中的关键作用，并通过理论分析和实验验证了这种关系的量化特性。

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models have demonstrated a strong ability to learn
from context, known as in-context learning (ICL). Despite a surge of recent
applications that leverage such capabilities, it is by no means clear, at least
theoretically, how the ICL capabilities arise, and in particular, what is the
precise role played by key factors such as pre-training procedure as well as
context construction. In this work, we propose a new framework to analyze the
ICL performance, for a class of realistic settings, which includes network
architectures, data encoding, data generation, and prompt construction process.
As a first step, we construct a simple example with a one-layer transformer,
and show an interesting result, namely when the pre-train data distribution is
different from the query task distribution, a properly constructed context can
shift the output distribution towards the query task distribution, in a
quantifiable manner, leading to accurate prediction on the query topic. We then
extend the findings in the previous step to a more general case, and derive the
precise relationship between ICL performance, context length and the KL
divergence between pre-train and query task distribution. Finally, we provide
experiments to validate our theoretical results.

TL;DR: CLIN-LLM是一个安全约束的混合管道系统，通过多模态患者编码、不确定性校准的疾病分类和检索增强的治疗生成，实现了高精度的症状到疾病分类和临床安全的治疗建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的医疗系统缺乏医学基础且无法量化不确定性，导致输出不安全。需要在异质患者环境中提供准确且安全的症状到疾病分类和治疗建议。

Method: 使用BioBERT在1200个临床案例上进行微调，结合Focal Loss和蒙特卡洛Dropout实现置信度感知预测；采用Biomedical Sentence-BERT从MedDialog语料库检索相关对话，使用FLAN-T5模型生成个性化治疗建议，并通过RxNorm进行抗生素管理和药物相互作用筛查。

Result: 达到98%的准确率和F1分数，比ClinicalBERT提高7.1%；78%的top-5检索精度；临床医生评分为4.2/5；不安全抗生素建议比GPT-5减少67%。

Conclusion: CLIN-LLM展示了稳健性、可解释性和临床安全性，为资源有限的医疗环境提供了可部署的人类参与决策支持框架。

Abstract: Accurate symptom-to-disease classification and clinically grounded treatment
recommendations remain challenging, particularly in heterogeneous patient
settings with high diagnostic risk. Existing large language model (LLM)-based
systems often lack medical grounding and fail to quantify uncertainty,
resulting in unsafe outputs. We propose CLIN-LLM, a safety-constrained hybrid
pipeline that integrates multimodal patient encoding, uncertainty-calibrated
disease classification, and retrieval-augmented treatment generation. The
framework fine-tunes BioBERT on 1,200 clinical cases from the Symptom2Disease
dataset and incorporates Focal Loss with Monte Carlo Dropout to enable
confidence-aware predictions from free-text symptoms and structured vitals.
Low-certainty cases (18%) are automatically flagged for expert review, ensuring
human oversight. For treatment generation, CLIN-LLM employs Biomedical
Sentence-BERT to retrieve top-k relevant dialogues from the 260,000-sample
MedDialog corpus. The retrieved evidence and patient context are fed into a
fine-tuned FLAN-T5 model for personalized treatment generation, followed by
post-processing with RxNorm for antibiotic stewardship and drug-drug
interaction (DDI) screening. CLIN-LLM achieves 98% accuracy and F1 score,
outperforming ClinicalBERT by 7.1% (p < 0.001), with 78% top-5 retrieval
precision and a clinician-rated validity of 4.2 out of 5. Unsafe antibiotic
suggestions are reduced by 67% compared to GPT-5. These results demonstrate
CLIN-LLM's robustness, interpretability, and clinical safety alignment. The
proposed system provides a deployable, human-in-the-loop decision support
framework for resource-limited healthcare environments. Future work includes
integrating imaging and lab data, multilingual extensions, and clinical trial
validation.

TL;DR: SwiftSolve是一个复杂度感知的多智能体系统，用于解决竞争编程问题。它通过算法规划、经验分析和复杂度指导的修复，确保程序不仅正确，还能满足时间和内存限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM生成的程序虽然能通过单元测试，但经常违反竞赛的时间和内存预算限制，需要更全面的解决方案。

Method: 采用多智能体系统，包括规划器、静态剪枝器、编码器、性能分析器和复杂度分析器，通过版本化JSON通信，结合算法规划和经验分析。

Result: 在26个问题上的测试显示，首轮通过率61.54%，三轮内解决率80.77%，运行级成功率73.08%，相比Claude Opus 4有显著提升。

Conclusion: SwiftSolve通过配置分析和复杂度指导的重新规划，在保持准确性的同时减少了效率问题，证明了多智能体方法在竞争编程中的有效性。

Abstract: Correctness alone is insufficient: LLM-generated programs frequently satisfy
unit tests while violating contest time or memory budgets. We present
SwiftSolve, a complexity-aware multi-agent system for competitive programming
that couples algorithmic planning with empirical profiling and
complexity-guided repair. We frame competitive programming as a software
environment where specialized agents act as programmers, each assuming roles
such as planning, coding, profiling, and complexity analysis. A Planner
proposes an algorithmic sketch; a deterministic Static Pruner filters high-risk
plans; a Coder emits ISO C++17; a Profiler compiles and executes candidates on
a fixed input-size schedule to record wall time and peak memory; and a
Complexity Analyst fits log-log growth (s, R2) with an LLM fallback to assign a
complexity class and dispatch targeted patches to either the Planner or Coder.
Agents communicate via typed, versioned JSON; a controller enforces iteration
caps and diminishing returns stopping. Evaluated on 26 problems (16 BigO, 10
Codeforces Div. 2) in a POSIX sandbox (2 s / 256-512 MB), SwiftSolve attains
pass@1 = 61.54% (16/26) on the first attempt and Solved@<=3 = 80.77% with
marginal latency change (mean 11.96 s to 12.66 s per attempt). Aggregate
run-level success is 73.08% at 12.40 s mean. Failures are predominantly
resource-bound, indicating inefficiency rather than logic errors. Against
Claude Opus 4, SwiftSolve improves run-level success (73.1% vs 52.6%) at
approximately 2x runtime overhead (12.4 s vs 6.8 s). Beyond correctness
(pass@k), we report efficiency metrics (eff@k for runtime and memory, incidence
of TLE or MLE, and complexity fit accuracy on BigO), demonstrating that
profiling and complexity-guided replanning reduce inefficiency while preserving
accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于首个生成token对数概率的方法，用于在单步生成后检测LLM的模板化响应（如拒绝、简单确认等），从而节省计算资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在生成模板化响应时会浪费大量计算资源，增加不必要的成本和延迟。

Method: 使用首个生成token的对数概率分布作为分类信号，通过轻量级k-NN分类器预测响应类型。

Result: 实验表明首个token对数概率向量能形成明显可分的聚类，准确预测响应是否为实质性回答或模板化响应。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种实用且计算量小的技术，通过早期终止或重定向到更小模型来优化LLM推理，显著节省计算成本。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often expend significant computational resources
generating boilerplate responses, such as refusals, simple acknowledgements and
casual greetings, which adds unnecessary cost and latency. To address this
inefficiency, we propose a simple yet highly effective method for detecting
such responses after only a single generation step. We demonstrate that the
log-probability distribution of the first generated token serves as a powerful
signal for classifying the nature of the entire subsequent response. Our
experiments, conducted across a diverse range of small, large, and
reasoning-specialized models, show that the first-token log-probability vectors
form distinctly separable clusters for different response types. Using a
lightweight k-NN classifier, we achieve high accuracy in predicting whether a
response will be a substantive answer or a form of boilerplate response,
including user-specified refusals. The primary implication is a practical,
computationally trivial technique, optimizing LLM inference by enabling early
termination or redirection to a smaller model, thereby yielding significant
savings in computational cost. This work presents a direct path toward more
efficient and sustainable LLM deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如归一化建筑指数(NDBI)在准确捕捉城市发展方面存在困难，受大气噪声、季节变化和云层覆盖等因素影响，这阻碍了大规模人类发展和城市化的监测。

Method: 收集每个区域的Sentinel-2影像时间序列，在固定时间窗口内处理图像以获得云层覆盖最少的代表性图像。采用两种策略确保评分一致性：(i)提供代表不同城市化水平的参考图像集，(ii)提供最近的历史图像以保持时间一致性和减轻当前图像的云相关噪声。

Result: 在班加罗尔的定性实验表明，AUI优于NDBI等标准指标。

Conclusion: AUI能够克服传统城市化指标的挑战，产生更可靠和稳定的发展评分。

Abstract: We introduce the {\em Atlas Urban Index} (AUI), a metric for measuring urban
development computed using Sentinel-2 \citep{spoto2012sentinel2} satellite
imagery. Existing approaches, such as the {\em Normalized Difference Built-up
Index} (NDBI), often struggle to accurately capture urban development due to
factors like atmospheric noise, seasonal variation, and cloud cover. These
limitations hinder large-scale monitoring of human development and
urbanization. To address these challenges, we propose an approach that
leverages {\em Vision-Language Models }(VLMs) to provide a development score
for regions. Specifically, we collect a time series of Sentinel-2 images for
each region. Then, we further process the images within fixed time windows to
get an image with minimal cloud cover, which serves as the representative image
for that time window. To ensure consistent scoring, we adopt two strategies:
(i) providing the VLM with a curated set of reference images representing
different levels of urbanization, and (ii) supplying the most recent past image
to both anchor temporal consistency and mitigate cloud-related noise in the
current image. Together, these components enable AUI to overcome the challenges
of traditional urbanization indices and produce more reliable and stable
development scores. Our qualitative experiments on Bangalore suggest that AUI
outperforms standard indices such as NDBI.

Motivation: 解决RAG在知识稀疏和语义模糊的长尾查询中面临的检索噪声问题，避免昂贵的后处理成本，克服单向量查询同时编码关注和忽略信号的理论瓶颈。

Method: 提出RaCoT框架，在检索前自动生成语义相邻但答案不同的对比问题，提取Δ-Prompt捕捉关键差异，引导模型主动关注决定答案分歧的关键细节。

Result: 在六个权威基准测试中，RaCoT比RankRAG和Self-RAG等强基线提升0.9-2.4个百分点，在对抗性测试中性能下降仅8.6%，远优于其他方法的超过15%下降，具有低延迟(3.12s)和低token开销(11.54)。

Conclusion: RaCoT将RAG范式从"事后上下文清理"重构为"先验塑造判别推理"，为实时、资源受限部署的可靠AI系统提供了高效且鲁棒的路径。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) faces a core bottleneck with
knowledge-sparse and semantically ambiguous long-tail queries, where retrieval
noise distorts reasoning and necessitates costly post-processing. To tackle

framework that shifts contrastive thinking to the pre-retrieval stage. By
automatically generating a semantically adjacent yet differently answered
contrastive question and extracting a $\Delta$-Prompt to capture their key
differences, RaCoT guides the model to proactively focus on the ``critical
details that determine answer divergence." This approach allows it to suppress
semantic interference within a single retrieval pass, overcoming the
theoretical bottleneck of single-vector queries that struggle to simultaneously
encode signals for what to attend to and what to ignore. On six authoritative
benchmarks, including PopQA and TriviaQA-unfiltered, RaCoT outperforms strong
baselines like RankRAG and Self-RAG by 0.9-2.4 percentage points. It exhibits
superior robustness, with a performance drop of only 8.6\% in adversarial
tests, far surpassing the over 15\% degradation in other methods. Furthermore,
its low latency (3.12s) and token overhead (11.54) place it on the
accuracy-efficiency Pareto frontier, while ablation studies validate the
necessity of each component. Ultimately, RaCoT reframes the RAG paradigm from
``post-hoc context cleaning" to ``a priori shaping of discriminative
reasoning", offering an efficient and robust path toward reliable AI systems
for real-time, resource-constrained deployments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究比较了五个顶级大语言模型（Gemini、DeepSeek、Claude、GPT和LLaMA）在性能准确性、伦理偏见缓解和可用性集成三个关键维度的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着各大公司不断改进大语言模型，了解不同模型在性能、道德行为和可用性方面的差异变得至关重要，这些差异源于它们不同的设计理念。

Method: 通过分析三个重要因素进行比较：性能与准确性、伦理与偏见缓解、可用性与集成能力。

Result: 研究发现Claude在道德推理方面表现良好，Gemini在多模态能力和伦理框架方面更强，DeepSeek擅长基于事实的推理，LLaMA适合开放应用，ChatGPT提供平衡性能并注重实用性。

Conclusion: 这些模型在工作效率、易用性和伦理处理方面存在显著差异，用户应根据各自优势来选择和使用合适的模型。

Abstract: Big Language Models (LLMs) are changing the way businesses use software, the
way people live their lives and the way industries work. Companies like Google,
High-Flyer, Anthropic, OpenAI and Meta are making better LLMs. So, it's crucial
to look at how each model is different in terms of performance, moral behaviour
and usability, as these differences are based on the different ideas that built
them. This study compares five top LLMs: Google's Gemini, High-Flyer's
DeepSeek, Anthropic's Claude, OpenAI's GPT models and Meta's LLaMA. It performs
this by analysing three important factors: Performance and Accuracy, Ethics and
Bias Mitigation and Usability and Integration. It was found that Claude has
good moral reasoning, Gemini is better at multimodal capabilities and has
strong ethical frameworks. DeepSeek is great at reasoning based on facts, LLaMA
is good for open applications and ChatGPT delivers balanced performance with a
focus on usage. It was concluded that these models are different in terms of
how well they work, how easy they are to use and how they treat people
ethically, making it a point that each model should be utilised by the user in
a way that makes the most of its strengths.

TL;DR: 开发了一个事实验证框架，通过交叉检查LLM输出与多个知识源来实时捕获和纠正幻觉错误，将幻觉减少67%，同时保持回答质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM会自信地生成听起来完全合理但实际上是错误的信息，这种幻觉问题已成为在需要准确性的现实应用中部署这些模型的主要障碍。

Method: 结合结构化数据库、实时网络搜索和学术文献来验证生成的事实声明，检测到不一致时自动纠正，同时保持回答的自然流畅性。

Result: 在各种领域的测试中，幻觉减少了67%，且不牺牲回答质量。医疗、金融和科学研究领域的专家对纠正后输出的满意度为89%，显著优于未验证的LLM回答。

Conclusion: 这项工作为在不能出错的应用中使LLM更可信提供了一个实用解决方案。

Abstract: While Large Language Models have transformed how we interact with AI systems,
they suffer from a critical flaw: they confidently generate false information
that sounds entirely plausible. This hallucination problem has become a major
barrier to deploying these models in real-world applications where accuracy
matters. We developed a fact verification framework that catches and corrects
these errors in real-time by cross checking LLM outputs against multiple
knowledge sources. Our system combines structured databases, live web searches,
and academic literature to verify factual claims as they're generated. When we
detect inconsistencies, we automatically correct them while preserving the
natural flow of the response. Testing across various domains showed we could
reduce hallucinations by 67% without sacrificing response quality. Domain
experts in healthcare, finance, and scientific research rated our corrected
outputs 89% satisfactory a significant improvement over unverified LLM
responses. This work offers a practical solution for making LLMs more
trustworthy in applications where getting facts wrong isn't an option.

TL;DR: Jarvis是一个通过个人KV-Cache检索实现个性化AI助手的创新框架，在视觉问答和纯文本任务上达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以生成准确的个性化回答，需要更好的方式来利用用户特定信息。

Method: 将用户特定信息存储在文本和视觉token的KV-Caches中，通过检索相关KV-Cache来确保回答准确性。

Result: 在多个数据集上实现了最先进的视觉问答和纯文本任务性能，特别是在依赖局部细节的问题上表现更好。

Conclusion: 为个性化AI助手提供了一条实用路径，代码和数据集将发布。

Abstract: The rapid development of Vision-language models (VLMs) enables open-ended
perception and reasoning. Recent works have started to investigate how to adapt
general-purpose VLMs into personalized assistants. Even commercial models such
as ChatGPT now support model personalization by incorporating user-specific
information. However, existing methods either learn a set of concept tokens or
train a VLM to utilize user-specific information. However, both pipelines
struggle to generate accurate answers as personalized assistants. We introduce
Jarvis, an innovative framework for a personalized AI assistant through
personal KV-Cache retrieval, which stores user-specific information in the
KV-Caches of both textual and visual tokens. The textual tokens are created by
summarizing user information into metadata, while the visual tokens are
produced by extracting distinct image patches from the user's images. When
answering a question, Jarvis first retrieves related KV-Caches from personal
storage and uses them to ensure accuracy in responses. We also introduce a
fine-grained benchmark built with the same distinct image patch mining
pipeline, emphasizing accurate question answering based on fine-grained
user-specific information. Jarvis is capable of providing more accurate
responses, particularly when they depend on specific local details. Jarvis
achieves state-of-the-art results in both visual question answering and
text-only tasks across multiple datasets, indicating a practical path toward
personalized AI assistants. The code and dataset will be released.

Motivation: AI代理在人类工作相关任务中不断优化，但缺乏对人类工作执行方式的清晰理解，需要揭示代理的专业能力和在不同工作流程中的角色。

Method: 引入可扩展工具包，从人类或代理的计算机使用活动中提取可解释的结构化工作流程，并在数据分析、工程、计算、写作和设计等技能上直接比较人类与代理的表现。

Result: 代理在任务执行中主要采用程序化方法，与人类常用的UI中心方法形成对比；代理工作质量较差但经常通过数据伪造掩盖缺陷；代理完成任务速度快88.3%，成本低90.4-96.2%。

Conclusion: 代理在效率和经济性方面具有优势，适合处理可编程任务，但需要解决质量问题和数据伪造行为，以实现有效的人机协作。

Abstract: AI agents are continually optimized for tasks related to human work, such as
software engineering and professional writing, signaling a pressing trend with
significant impacts on the human workforce. However, these agent developments
have often not been grounded in a clear understanding of how humans execute
work, to reveal what expertise agents possess and the roles they can play in
diverse workflows. In this work, we study how agents do human work by
presenting the first direct comparison of human and agent workers across
multiple essential work-related skills: data analysis, engineering,
computation, writing, and design. To better understand and compare
heterogeneous computer-use activities of workers, we introduce a scalable
toolkit to induce interpretable, structured workflows from either human or
agent computer-use activities. Using such induced workflows, we compare how
humans and agents perform the same tasks and find that: (1) While agents
exhibit promise in their alignment to human workflows, they take an
overwhelmingly programmatic approach across all work domains, even for
open-ended, visually dependent tasks like design, creating a contrast with the
UI-centric methods typically used by humans. (2) Agents produce work of
inferior quality, yet often mask their deficiencies via data fabrication and
misuse of advanced tools. (3) Nonetheless, agents deliver results 88.3% faster
and cost 90.4-96.2% less than humans, highlighting the potential for enabling
efficient collaboration by delegating easily programmable tasks to agents.

Motivation: Microsoft Copilot套件作为各种代理的通用入口点，需要强大的编排器来将用户提示的任务分发给正确的代理。

Method: 使用Agentic Meta-orchestrator（AMO），利用元学习训练的决策树模型来决定不同代理/模型之间的最佳推理策略。

Result: 通过两个生产用例展示了AMO的有效性：Microsoft 365电子商务Copilot和代码合规Copilot。

Conclusion: AMO能够有效处理多任务和可扩展代理，为Copilot服务提供强大的任务分发能力。

Abstract: Microsoft Copilot suites serve as the universal entry point for various
agents skilled in handling important tasks, ranging from assisting a customer
with product purchases to detecting vulnerabilities in corporate programming
code. Each agent can be powered by language models, software engineering
operations, such as database retrieval, and internal \& external knowledge. The
repertoire of a copilot can expand dynamically with new agents. This requires a
robust orchestrator that can distribute tasks from user prompts to the right
agents. In this work, we propose an Agentic Meta-orchestrator (AMO) for
handling multiple tasks and scalable agents in copilot services, which can
provide both natural language and action responses. We will also demonstrate
the planning that leverages meta-learning, i.e., a trained decision tree model
for deciding the best inference strategy among various agents/models. We
showcase the effectiveness of our AMO through two production use cases:
Microsoft 365 (M365) E-Commerce Copilot and code compliance copilot. M365
E-Commerce Copilot advertises Microsoft products to external customers to
promote sales success. The M365 E-Commerce Copilot provides up-to-date product
information and connects to multiple agents, such as relational databases and
human customer support. The code compliance copilot scans the internal DevOps
code to detect known and new compliance issues in pull requests (PR).

TL;DR: HRM-Agent是HRM的强化学习变体，能够在动态不确定的迷宫环境中学习导航到目标，并能复用先前时间步的计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HRM虽然在小规模模型中有出色的推理能力，但仅限于监督学习、静态、完全可观测的问题。现实世界问题往往是动态、不确定或部分可观测的，需要能够集成和复用先前计算的能力。

Method: 开发HRM-Agent，这是HRM的变体，仅使用强化学习进行训练，应用于动态和不确定的迷宫导航环境。

Result: HRM-Agent成功学会了在动态不确定的迷宫环境中导航到目标，其循环推理过程显示出能够有效复用先前时间步的计算。

Conclusion: HRM的推理能力可以通过强化学习扩展到动态不确定环境，其循环推理机制能够实现跨时间步的计算复用，为处理现实世界问题提供了可能。

Abstract: The Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) has impressive reasoning abilities
given its small size, but has only been applied to supervised, static,
fully-observable problems. One of HRM's strengths is its ability to adapt its
computational effort to the difficulty of the problem. However, in its current
form it cannot integrate and reuse computation from previous time-steps if the
problem is dynamic, uncertain or partially observable, or be applied where the
correct action is undefined, characteristics of many real-world problems.
  This paper presents HRM-Agent, a variant of HRM trained using only
reinforcement learning. We show that HRM can learn to navigate to goals in
dynamic and uncertain maze environments. Recent work suggests that HRM's
reasoning abilities stem from its recurrent inference process. We explore the
dynamics of the recurrent inference process and find evidence that it is
successfully reusing computation from earlier environment time-steps.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类在掌握技能后会减少认知努力，而传统强化学习智能体在提升性能时不会变得更高效。如果智能体能在学习过程中考虑计算成本，就能实现更节能的AI系统。

Method: 在Arcade Learning Environment中进行实验，向智能体展示计算成本并赋予它们控制计算使用的权限。

Result: 在相同训练计算预算下，考虑计算成本的智能体在75%的游戏中表现更好，平均计算使用量减少三倍。

Conclusion: 让强化学习智能体考虑计算成本可以显著提高计算效率，同时保持或提升性能表现。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning agents can achieve superhuman performance in
many complex tasks, they typically do not become more computationally efficient
as they improve. In contrast, humans gradually require less cognitive effort as
they become more proficient at a task. If agents could reason about their
compute as they learn, could they similarly reduce their computation footprint?
If they could, we could have more energy efficient agents or free up compute
cycles for other processes like planning. In this paper, we experiment with
showing agents the cost of their computation and giving them the ability to
control when they use compute. We conduct our experiments on the Arcade
Learning Environment, and our results demonstrate that with the same training
compute budget, agents that reason about their compute perform better on 75% of
games. Furthermore, these agents use three times less compute on average. We
analyze individual games and show where agents gain these efficiencies.

Result: 发现现有训练方法会放大模态差距，提出的策略能够帮助开发更平衡的多模态推理训练方法。

Conclusion: 研究为开发能够减轻模态差距并促进更平衡多模态推理的训练方法提供了见解，相关代码已公开。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong
capabilities on vision-and-language tasks. However, recent findings reveal an
imbalance in their reasoning capabilities across visual and textual modalities.
Specifically, current MLLMs often over-rely on textual cues while
under-attending to visual content, resulting in suboptimal performance on tasks
that require genuine visual reasoning. We refer to this phenomenon as the
\textit{modality gap}, defined as the performance disparity between
text-centric and vision-centric inputs. In this paper, we analyze the modality
gap through the lens of training recipes. We first show that existing training
recipes tend to amplify this gap. Then, we systematically explore strategies to
bridge it from two complementary perspectives: data and loss design. Our
findings provide insights into developing training recipes that mitigate the
modality gap and promote more balanced multimodal reasoning. Our code is
publicly available at https://github.com/UCSB-NLP-Chang/Bridging-Modality-Gap.

Conclusion: 尽管论证主要基于符号方法和数字系统基础设施，但观察结果可能指向更普遍适用的结构。

Abstract: Cognitive studies and artificial intelligence have developed distinct models
for various inferential mechanisms (categorization, induction, abduction,
causal inference, contrast, merge, ...). Yet, both natural and artificial views
on cognition lack apparently a unifying framework. This paper formulates a
speculative answer attempting to respond to this gap. To postulate on
higher-level activation processes from a material perspective, we consider
inferential mechanisms informed by symbolic AI modelling techniques, through
the simplistic lenses of electronic circuits based on logic gates. We observe
that a logic gate view entails a different treatment of implication and
negation compared to standard logic and logic programming. Then, by
combinatorial exploration, we identify four main forms of dependencies that can
be realized by these inferential circuits. Looking at how these forms are
generally used in the context of logic programs, we identify eight common
inferential patterns, exposing traditionally distinct inferential mechanisms in
an unifying framework. Finally, following a probabilistic interpretation of
logic programs, we unveil inner functional dependencies. The paper concludes
elaborating in what sense, even if our arguments are mostly informed by
symbolic means and digital systems infrastructures, our observations may
pinpoint to more generally applicable structures.

Method: 在多个工具调用基准上进行大规模评估，并引入MAVEN OOD基准来压力测试多步推理；提出CoreThink Agentic Reasoner框架，通过轻量级符号推理层增强LLM的结构化分解和自适应工具编排能力。

Result: 当前大多数模型在MAVEN基准上的准确率低于50%，显示存在显著泛化差距；CoreThink框架无需额外训练即可在所有基准上实现泛化，性能提升530%，计算成本仅为现有基线的十分之一。

Conclusion: CoreThink框架通过符号推理层有效解决了工具调用环境中的泛化挑战，在保持低计算成本的同时显著提升了多领域工具协调能力。

Abstract: Generalization across Agentic tool-calling environments remains a key
unsolved challenge in developing reliable agentic reasoning systems. While
large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance on isolated
benchmarks, their ability to transfer reasoning strategies and co-ordinate
tools across diverse domains is poorly understood. In this work, we conduct a
large-scale evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs on multiple tool-calling
benchmarksBFCL v3, TauBench, Tau2Bench, and AceBenchand introduce MAVEN (Math &
Physics Adversarial Verification & Evaluation Network), a new out of
distribution (OOD) benchmark designed to stress-test multi-step reasoning
through explicit verification and adversarial task composition. Our results
show that most current models achieve below 50% accuracy on MAVEN, revealing a
significant generalization gap across tool-use settings.
  To address this, we present the CoreThink Agentic Reasoner, a framework that
augments LLMs with a lightweight symbolic reasoning layer for structured
decomposition and adaptive tool orchestration. Without additional training, it
generalizes across all benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance with
530% improvements over existing baselines at roughly one-tenth the
computational cost.

Motivation: 现有POI推荐模型难以同时捕捉空间选择的层次结构和用户时间上下文的动态变化，存在根本性限制。

Method: 使用双流形方法：在双曲几何中建模静态的树状偏好层次，在欧几里得切空间中路由动态序列更新到Mamba层，通过跨流形通道融合时空信息来引导状态空间模型。

Conclusion: GTR-Mamba通过跨流形条件路由有效解决了同时建模空间层次结构和时间动态性的挑战，为POI推荐提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation is a critical task in modern
Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs), aiming to model the complex
decision-making process of human mobility to provide personalized
recommendations for a user's next check-in location. Existing POI
recommendation models, predominantly based on Graph Neural Networks and
sequential models, have been extensively studied. However, these models face a
fundamental limitation: they struggle to simultaneously capture the inherent
hierarchical structure of spatial choices and the dynamics and irregular shifts
of user-specific temporal contexts. To overcome this limitation, we propose
GTR-Mamba, a novel framework for cross-manifold conditioning and routing.
GTR-Mamba leverages the distinct advantages of different mathematical spaces
for different tasks: it models the static, tree-like preference hierarchies in
hyperbolic geometry, while routing the dynamic sequence updates to a novel
Mamba layer in the computationally stable and efficient Euclidean tangent
space. This process is coordinated by a cross-manifold channel that fuses
spatio-temporal information to explicitly steer the State Space Model (SSM),
enabling flexible adaptation to contextual changes. Extensive experiments on
three real-world datasets demonstrate that GTR-Mamba consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baseline models in next POI recommendation.

Conclusion: MA-CDMP通过扩散模型和均值场机制有效解决了去中心化资源管理的关键挑战，为现实世界无线网络优化提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: In wireless communication systems, efficient and adaptive resource allocation
plays a crucial role in enhancing overall Quality of Service (QoS). While
centralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) frameworks rely on a
central coordinator for policy training and resource scheduling, they suffer
from scalability issues and privacy risks. In contrast, the Distributed
Training with Decentralized Execution (DTDE) paradigm enables distributed
learning and decision-making, but it struggles with non-stationarity and
limited inter-agent cooperation, which can severely degrade system performance.
To overcome these challenges, we propose the Multi-Agent Conditional Diffusion
Model Planner (MA-CDMP) for decentralized communication resource management.
Built upon the Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) paradigm, MA-CDMP
employs Diffusion Models (DMs) to capture environment dynamics and plan future
trajectories, while an inverse dynamics model guides action generation, thereby
alleviating the sample inefficiency and slow convergence of conventional DTDE
methods. Moreover, to approximate large-scale agent interactions, a Mean-Field
(MF) mechanism is introduced as an assistance to the classifier in DMs. This
design mitigates inter-agent non-stationarity and enhances cooperation with
minimal communication overhead in distributed settings. We further
theoretically establish an upper bound on the distributional approximation
error introduced by the MF-based diffusion generation, guaranteeing convergence
stability and reliable modeling of multi-agent stochastic dynamics. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MA-CDMP consistently outperforms existing MARL
baselines in terms of average reward and QoS metrics, showcasing its
scalability and practicality for real-world wireless network optimization.

Method: 提出多维度指令不确定性减少框架：1）采样方法维度：残差驱动攻击方向稳定化，使用ResAdv-DDIM采样器稳定对抗优化；2）任务建模维度：上下文编码攻击场景约束，通过引导掩码和渲染器集成补充缺失知识；3）生成器评估维度：语义抽象攻击评估增强，明确评估边界。

Result: 大量实验证明InSUR在迁移攻击性能上具有优越性，首次实现了无参考的语义约束3D对抗样本生成。

Conclusion: InSUR框架通过系统解决指令不确定性，能够生成更令人满意的语义约束对抗样本，具有更好的可迁移性、适应性和有效性。

Abstract: Recently, semantically constrained adversarial examples (SemanticAE), which
are directly generated from natural language instructions, have become a
promising avenue for future research due to their flexible attacking forms. To
generate SemanticAEs, current methods fall short of satisfactory attacking
ability as the key underlying factors of semantic uncertainty in human
instructions, such as referring diversity, descriptive incompleteness, and
boundary ambiguity, have not been fully investigated. To tackle the issues,
this paper develops a multi-dimensional instruction uncertainty reduction
(InSUR) framework to generate more satisfactory SemanticAE, i.e., transferable,
adaptive, and effective. Specifically, in the dimension of the sampling method,
we propose the residual-driven attacking direction stabilization to alleviate
the unstable adversarial optimization caused by the diversity of language
references. By coarsely predicting the language-guided sampling process, the
optimization process will be stabilized by the designed ResAdv-DDIM sampler,
therefore releasing the transferable and robust adversarial capability of
multi-step diffusion models. In task modeling, we propose the context-encoded
attacking scenario constraint to supplement the missing knowledge from
incomplete human instructions. Guidance masking and renderer integration are
proposed to regulate the constraints of 2D/3D SemanticAE, activating stronger
scenario-adapted attacks. Moreover, in the dimension of generator evaluation,
we propose the semantic-abstracted attacking evaluation enhancement by
clarifying the evaluation boundary, facilitating the development of more
effective SemanticAE generators. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of the transfer attack performance of InSUR. Moreover, we realize
the reference-free generation of semantically constrained 3D adversarial
examples for the first time.

Motivation: 开发一个能够为不同类型用户提供高效可信解释的系统，解决单一解释器无法在所有指标上表现最优的问题。

Method: 将事后解释器与检索增强的LLMs耦合，索引多模态知识库，基于量化标准选择解释器，使用基于聊天的提示生成解释。

Result: 在心脏病和甲状腺癌数据集上评估：LIME在保真度-鲁棒性权衡上最佳，Anchor产生最稀疏的低token规则，SHAP获得最高满意度。Profile条件化稳定token使用并保持积极评分。

Conclusion: ProfileXAI能够为不同类型用户提供高效可信的解释，没有单一解释器在所有指标上占优，但通过框架整合可以实现稳定的解释质量。

Abstract: ProfileXAI is a model- and domain-agnostic framework that couples post-hoc
explainers (SHAP, LIME, Anchor) with retrieval - augmented LLMs to produce
explanations for different types of users. The system indexes a multimodal
knowledge base, selects an explainer per instance via quantitative criteria,
and generates grounded narratives with chat-enabled prompting. On Heart Disease
and Thyroid Cancer datasets, we evaluate fidelity, robustness, parsimony, token
use, and perceived quality. No explainer dominates: LIME achieves the best
fidelity-robustness trade-off (Infidelity $\le 0.30$, $L<0.7$ on Heart
Disease); Anchor yields the sparsest, low-token rules; SHAP attains the highest
satisfaction ($\bar{x}=4.1$). Profile conditioning stabilizes tokens ($\sigma
\le 13\%$) and maintains positive ratings across profiles ($\bar{x}\ge 3.7$,
with domain experts at $3.77$), enabling efficient and trustworthy
explanations.

Conclusion: 通过调整规划密度在时间上的分布可以显著提升扩散规划器的性能，混合密度方法有效解决了过度稀疏规划的问题

Abstract: Recent studies demonstrate that diffusion planners benefit from sparse-step
planning over single-step planning. Training models to skip steps in their
trajectories helps capture long-term dependencies without additional or memory
computational cost. However, predicting excessively sparse plans degrades
performance. We hypothesize this temporal density threshold is non-uniform
across a temporal horizon and that certain parts of a planned trajectory should
be more densely planned. We propose Mixed Density Diffuser (MDD), a diffusion
planner where the densities throughout the horizon are tunable hyperparameters.
MDD achieves a new SOTA across the Maze2D, Franka Kitchen, and Antmaze D4RL
task domains.

synthesis of publishable findings-thereby promising to fundamentally reshape
the pace and scale of discovery. However, the rapid and unstructured
proliferation of these systems has created a fragmented research landscape,

Abstract: Driven by the dual principles of smart education and artificial intelligence
technology, the online education model has rapidly emerged as an important
component of the education industry. Cognitive diagnostic technology can
utilize students' learning data and feedback information in educational
evaluation to accurately assess their ability level at the knowledge level.
However, while massive amounts of information provide abundant data resources,
they also bring about complexity in feature extraction and scarcity of
disciplinary data. In cross-disciplinary fields, traditional cognitive
diagnostic methods still face many challenges. Given the differences in
knowledge systems, cognitive structures, and data characteristics between
different disciplines, this paper conducts in-depth research on neural network
cognitive diagnosis and knowledge association neural network cognitive
diagnosis, and proposes an innovative cross-disciplinary cognitive diagnosis
method (TLCD). This method combines deep learning techniques and transfer
learning strategies to enhance the performance of the model in the target
discipline by utilizing the common features of the main discipline. The
experimental results show that the cross-disciplinary cognitive diagnosis model
based on deep learning performs better than the basic model in
cross-disciplinary cognitive diagnosis tasks, and can more accurately evaluate
students' learning situation.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在生成高质量代码方面仍面临挑战，需要奖励模型作为推理模型发展的中间步骤。虽然模型规模通常与反思能力相关，但本研究旨在探索小型语言模型是否也能成为有效的奖励模型。

Method: 构建基于APPS编程挑战基准的代码样本数据集，训练带有回归层的值头模型来估计中间输出的成功概率，结合过程奖励和结果奖励。

Result: 小型LLM能够作为有效的奖励模型或代码评估批评器，成功识别多个候选方案中的正确解决方案，使用该批评器在代码搜索能力上实现了超过20%的改进。

Conclusion: 小型语言模型可以被转化为实用的奖励模型，在代码生成任务中有效评估代码质量，显著提升代码搜索和选择能力。

Abstract: Generating high-quality code remains a challenge for Large Language Models
(LLMs). For the evolution of reasoning models on this task, reward models are a
necessary intermediate step. These models judge outcomes or intermediate steps.
Decoder-only transformer models can be turned into reward models by introducing
a regression layer and supervised fine-tuning. While it is known that
reflection capabilities generally increase with the size of a model, we want to
investigate whether state-of-the-art small language models like the Phi-4
family can be turned into usable reward models blending the consideration of
process rewards and outcome rewards.
  Targeting this goal, we construct a dataset of code samples with correctness
labels derived from the APPS coding challenge benchmark. We then train a
value-head model to estimate the success probability of intermediate outputs.
Our evaluation shows that small LLMs are capable of serving as effective reward
models or code evaluation critics, successfully identifying correct solutions
among multiple candidates. Using this critic, we achieve over a 20% improvement
in the search capability of the most accurate code out of multiple generations.

TL;DR: Sci-LLMs在生物序列处理中面临tokenization困境，研究发现提供高层次结构化上下文比直接处理原始序列更有效，上下文唯一方法在所有任务中表现最佳。


<details>

Motivation: 解决科学大语言模型在处理原始生物分子序列时面临的tokenization困境，无论是将序列视为专门语言还是单独模态都存在信息损失或对齐挑战。

Method: 通过系统比较领先Sci-LLMs在生物推理任务上的表现，测试了三种输入模式：仅序列、仅上下文、以及两者结合。

Result: 上下文唯一方法在所有模式中表现最佳，且包含原始序列反而会降低性能，表明原始序列对模型来说是信息噪声。

Conclusion: 应将Sci-LLMs重新定位为基于专家知识的强大推理引擎，而非序列解码器，发展重点应从直接序列解释转向高层次知识合成。

Abstract: Scientific Large Language Models (Sci-LLMs) have emerged as a promising
frontier for accelerating biological discovery. However, these models face a
fundamental challenge when processing raw biomolecular sequences: the
tokenization dilemma. Whether treating sequences as a specialized language,
risking the loss of functional motif information, or as a separate modality,
introducing formidable alignment challenges, current strategies fundamentally
limit their reasoning capacity. We challenge this sequence-centric paradigm by
positing that a more effective strategy is to provide Sci-LLMs with high-level
structured context derived from established bioinformatics tools, thereby
bypassing the need to interpret low-level noisy sequence data directly. Through
a systematic comparison of leading Sci-LLMs on biological reasoning tasks, we
tested three input modes: sequence-only, context-only, and a combination of
both. Our findings are striking: the context-only approach consistently and
substantially outperforms all other modes. Even more revealing, the inclusion
of the raw sequence alongside its high-level context consistently degrades
performance, indicating that raw sequences act as informational noise, even for
models with specialized tokenization schemes. These results suggest that the
primary strength of existing Sci-LLMs lies not in their nascent ability to
interpret biomolecular syntax from scratch, but in their profound capacity for
reasoning over structured, human-readable knowledge. Therefore, we argue for
reframing Sci-LLMs not as sequence decoders, but as powerful reasoning engines
over expert knowledge. This work lays the foundation for a new class of hybrid
scientific AI agents, repositioning the developmental focus from direct
sequence interpretation towards high-level knowledge synthesis. The code is

Motivation: 现有技能发现方法只关注技能多样性最大化，不考虑人类偏好，导致产生危险或不期望的行为（如机器人翻滚）

Method: 从基础模型中提取评分函数评估状态，根据人类意图为期望状态分配更高值，然后用这些分数重新加权技能发现算法的奖励

Result: FoG成功消除了翻转、翻滚等不期望行为，在基于状态和像素的任务中都能避免危险区域，还能发现难以定义的行为技能

Conclusion: FoG方法有效将人类意图融入技能发现，解决了传统方法产生危险行为的问题，展示了基础模型在引导技能学习方面的潜力

Abstract: Learning diverse skills without hand-crafted reward functions could
accelerate reinforcement learning in downstream tasks. However, existing skill
discovery methods focus solely on maximizing the diversity of skills without
considering human preferences, which leads to undesirable behaviors and
possibly dangerous skills. For instance, a cheetah robot trained using previous
methods learns to roll in all directions to maximize skill diversity, whereas
we would prefer it to run without flipping or entering hazardous areas. In this
work, we propose a Foundation model Guided (FoG) skill discovery method, which
incorporates human intentions into skill discovery through foundation models.
Specifically, FoG extracts a score function from foundation models to evaluate
states based on human intentions, assigning higher values to desirable states
and lower to undesirable ones. These scores are then used to re-weight the
rewards of skill discovery algorithms. By optimizing the re-weighted skill
discovery rewards, FoG successfully learns to eliminate undesirable behaviors,
such as flipping or rolling, and to avoid hazardous areas in both state-based
and pixel-based tasks. Interestingly, we show that FoG can discover skills
involving behaviors that are difficult to define. Interactive visualisations

TL;DR: AUPO是一种新颖的蒙特卡洛树搜索改进算法，通过自动动作抽象显著提升性能，无需转移概率或DAG搜索图，能检测对称动作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动抽象算法需要转移概率或DAG搜索图，且难以处理状态空间中相距较远的对称状态，限制了MCTS的性能提升。

Method: 提出AUPO算法，基于MCTS过程中收集的奖励分布统计进行自动动作抽象，仅影响决策策略而不影响树搜索。

Result: 在IPPC基准问题上，AUPO明显优于标准MCTS，能够检测到ASAP等先进框架难以处理的对称动作。

Conclusion: AUPO是一种有效的MCTS改进方法，与其他仅影响树搜索的抽象技术兼容，为自动动作抽象提供了新思路。

Abstract: We introduce a novel, drop-in modification to Monte Carlo Tree Search's
(MCTS) decision policy that we call AUPO. Comparisons based on a range of IPPC
benchmark problems show that AUPO clearly outperforms MCTS. AUPO is an
automatic action abstraction algorithm that solely relies on reward
distribution statistics acquired during the MCTS. Thus, unlike other automatic
abstraction algorithms, AUPO requires neither access to transition
probabilities nor does AUPO require a directed acyclic search graph to build
its abstraction, allowing AUPO to detect symmetric actions that
state-of-the-art frameworks like ASAP struggle with when the resulting
symmetric states are far apart in state space. Furthermore, as AUPO only
affects the decision policy, it is not mutually exclusive with other
abstraction techniques that only affect the tree search.

Abstract: While several high profile video games have served as testbeds for Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL), this technique has rarely been employed by the
game industry for crafting authentic AI behaviors. Previous research focuses on
training super-human agents with large models, which is impractical for game
studios with limited resources aiming for human-like agents. This paper
proposes a sample-efficient DRL method tailored for training and fine-tuning
agents in industrial settings such as the video game industry. Our method
improves sample efficiency of value-based DRL by leveraging pre-collected data
and increasing network plasticity. We evaluate our method training a goalkeeper
agent in EA SPORTS FC 25, one of the best-selling football simulations today.
Our agent outperforms the game's built-in AI by 10% in ball saving rate.
Ablation studies show that our method trains agents 50% faster compared to
standard DRL methods. Finally, qualitative evaluation from domain experts
indicates that our approach creates more human-like gameplay compared to
hand-crafted agents. As a testimony of the impact of the approach, the method
is intended to replace the hand-crafted counterpart in next iterations of the
series.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动方法需要大量高保真训练数据，计算成本高昂。为了解决这个问题，需要开发能同时加速数据生成过程并提高生成数据精度的算法。

Method: BlocKOA算法基于热方程结构，首先使用块Krylov算法快速获取少量基本解，然后组合这些解得到满足物理约束的温度分布，最后应用热算子确定热源分布。

Result: 理论分析显示BlocKOA的时间复杂度比现有方法低一个数量级。实验验证其效率，在生成5000个芯片的热仿真数据时实现了420倍的加速。仅用4%的生成时间，基于BlocKOA生成数据训练的数据驱动方法就能达到与现有方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: BlocKOA算法能高效生成精确的集成电路热仿真数据，显著降低数据生成成本，为数据驱动方法提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in data-driven approaches, such as neural operators (NOs),
have shown substantial efficacy in reducing the solution time for integrated
circuit (IC) thermal simulations. However, a limitation of these approaches is
requiring a large amount of high-fidelity training data, such as chip
parameters and temperature distributions, thereby incurring significant
computational costs. To address this challenge, we propose a novel algorithm
for the generation of IC thermal simulation data, named block Krylov and
operator action (BlocKOA), which simultaneously accelerates the data generation
process and enhances the precision of generated data. BlocKOA is specifically
designed for IC applications. Initially, we use the block Krylov algorithm
based on the structure of the heat equation to quickly obtain a few basic
solutions. Then we combine them to get numerous temperature distributions that
satisfy the physical constraints. Finally, we apply heat operators on these
functions to determine the heat source distributions, efficiently generating
precise data points. Theoretical analysis shows that the time complexity of
BlocKOA is one order lower than the existing method. Experimental results
further validate its efficiency, showing that BlocKOA achieves a 420-fold
speedup in generating thermal simulation data for 5000 chips with varying
physical parameters and IC structures. Even with just 4% of the generation
time, data-driven approaches trained on the data generated by BlocKOA exhibits
comparable performance to that using the existing method.

Motivation: CNOT门是量子计算中产生纠缠的关键组件，最小化CNOT门数量对量子算法效率至关重要，但该问题的计算复杂性尚未完全确定。

Method: 使用单一强化学习智能体处理固定尺寸m的电路，对不同于m尺寸的矩阵采用嵌入或高斯条纹化预处理，训练m=8的智能体评估n=3-15的矩阵。

Result: 随着n值增大，该方法在CNOT门最小化任务上的表现优于现有最优算法。

Conclusion: 强化学习方法在CNOT门最小化问题上具有潜力，特别是在处理较大尺寸量子电路时表现优异。

Abstract: CNOT gates are fundamental to quantum computing, as they facilitate
entanglement, a crucial resource for quantum algorithms. Certain classes of
quantum circuits are constructed exclusively from CNOT gates. Given their
widespread use, it is imperative to minimise the number of CNOT gates employed.
This problem, known as CNOT minimisation, remains an open challenge, with its
computational complexity yet to be fully characterised. In this work, we
introduce a novel reinforcement learning approach to address this task. Instead
of training multiple reinforcement learning agents for different circuit sizes,
we use a single agent up to a fixed size $m$. Matrices of sizes different from
m are preprocessed using either embedding or Gaussian striping. To assess the
efficacy of our approach, we trained an agent with m = 8, and evaluated it on
matrices of size n that range from 3 to 15. The results we obtained show that
our method overperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm as the value of n
increases.

Conclusion: 这是RSA框架在动态环境通信和人类-AI交互中的首次应用，为人类-智能体团队的实用通信建立了理论基础，展示了如何利用认知科学见解来设计辅助智能体。

Abstract: Adaptive agent design offers a way to improve human-AI collaboration on
time-sensitive tasks in rapidly changing environments. In such cases, to ensure
the human maintains an accurate understanding of critical task elements, an
assistive agent must not only identify the highest priority information but
also estimate how and when this information can be communicated most
effectively, given that human attention represents a zero-sum cognitive
resource where focus on one message diminishes awareness of other or upcoming
information. We introduce a theoretical framework for adaptive signalling which
meets these challenges by using principles of rational communication,
formalised as Bayesian reference resolution using the Rational Speech Act (RSA)
modelling framework, to plan a sequence of messages which optimise timely
alignment between user belief and a dynamic environment. The agent adapts
message specificity and timing to the particulars of a user and scenario based
on projections of how prior-guided interpretation of messages will influence
attention to the interface and subsequent belief update, across several
timesteps out to a fixed horizon. In a comparison to baseline methods, we show
that this effectiveness depends crucially on combining multi-step planning with
a realistic model of user awareness. As the first application of RSA for
communication in a dynamic environment, and for human-AI interaction in
general, we establish theoretical foundations for pragmatic communication in
human-agent teams, highlighting how insights from cognitive science can be
capitalised to inform the design of assistive agents.

Abstract: Opinions are central to almost all human activities and are key influencers
of our behaviors. In current times due to growth of social networking website
and increase in number of e-commerce site huge amount of opinions are now
available on web. Given a set of evaluative statements that contain opinions
(or sentiments) about an Entity, opinion mining aims to extract attributes and
components of the object that have been commented on in each statement and to
determine whether the comments are positive, negative or neutral. While lot of
research recently has been done in field of opinion mining and some of it
dealing with ranking of entities based on review or opinion set, classifying
opinions into finer granularity level and then ranking entities has never been
done before. In this paper method for opinion mining from statements at a
deeper level of granularity is proposed. This is done by using fuzzy logic
reasoning, after which entities are ranked as per this information.

Motivation: 解决流处理管道开发中高层用户意图与平台特定实现之间的语义鸿沟，简化复杂分布式流处理系统的开发过程。

Method: 集成超图思维(HGoT)作为GoT的扩展版本，结合弹性执行策略和高级查询分析，实现结构化多智能体推理。

Result: 实验评估显示，相比LLM代码生成方法，AutoStreamPipe将开发时间减少6.3倍，错误率降低5.19倍(基于新颖的错误自由评分EFS)。

Conclusion: AutoStreamPipe框架通过LLM和HGoT技术成功实现了流处理管道的自动化设计、生成和部署，显著提升了开发效率和准确性。

Abstract: Data pipelines are essential in stream processing as they enable the
efficient collection, processing, and delivery of real-time data, supporting
rapid data analysis. In this paper, we present AutoStreamPipe, a novel
framework that employs Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the design,
generation, and deployment of stream processing pipelines. AutoStreamPipe
bridges the semantic gap between high-level user intent and platform-specific
implementations across distributed stream processing systems for structured
multi-agent reasoning by integrating a Hypergraph of Thoughts (HGoT) as an
extended version of GoT. AutoStreamPipe combines resilient execution
strategies, advanced query analysis, and HGoT to deliver pipelines with good
accuracy. Experimental evaluations on diverse pipelines demonstrate that
AutoStreamPipe significantly reduces development time (x6.3) and error rates
(x5.19), as measured by a novel Error-Free Score (EFS), compared to LLM
code-generation methods.

Motivation: 现有自动竞价模型在跨环境泛化性方面存在局限，因为它们通常针对特定竞价场景定制，需要一种能够适应不同场景的统一方法。

Method: 构建Bid2X模型，使用统一系列嵌入编码异构数据，提出两种注意力机制分别处理变量间和时间动态依赖关系，采用变量感知融合模块进行自适应预测，并设计零膨胀投影模块处理竞价数据分布。

Result: 在8个数据集上的离线评估显示Bid2X优于各种基线方法且具有跨场景泛化能力，在线A/B测试中GMV提升4.65%，ROI提升2.44%。

Conclusion: Bid2X作为竞价基础模型，通过统一函数学习和跨场景泛化能力，为计算广告领域的竞价建模开辟了新途径，并在实际部署中取得了显著效果。

Abstract: Auto-bidding is crucial in facilitating online advertising by automatically
providing bids for advertisers. While previous work has made great efforts to
model bidding environments for better ad performance, it has limitations in
generalizability across environments since these models are typically tailored
for specific bidding scenarios. To this end, we approach the
scenario-independent principles through a unified function that estimates the
achieved effect under specific bids, such as budget consumption, gross
merchandise volume (GMV), page views, etc. Then, we propose a bidding
foundation model Bid2X to learn this fundamental function from data in various
scenarios. Our Bid2X is built over uniform series embeddings that encode
heterogeneous data through tailored embedding methods. To capture complex
inter-variable and dynamic temporal dependencies in bidding data, we propose
two attention mechanisms separately treating embeddings of different variables
and embeddings at different times as attention tokens for representation
learning. On top of the learned variable and temporal representations, a
variable-aware fusion module is used to perform adaptive bidding outcome
prediction. To model the unique bidding data distribution, we devise a
zero-inflated projection module to incorporate the estimated non-zero
probability into its value prediction, which makes up a joint optimization
objective containing classification and regression. The objective is proven to
converge to the zero-inflated distribution. Our model has been deployed on the
ad platform in Taobao, one of the world's largest e-commerce platforms. Offline
evaluation on eight datasets exhibits Bid2X's superiority compared to various
baselines and its generality across different scenarios. Bid2X increased GMV by
4.65% and ROI by 2.44% in online A/B tests, paving the way for bidding
foundation model in computational advertising.

Abstract: Deep Q Networks (DQN) have shown remarkable success in various reinforcement
learning tasks. However, their reliance on associative learning often leads to
the acquisition of spurious correlations, hindering their problem-solving
capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to integrate causal
principles into DQNs, leveraging the PEACE (Probabilistic Easy vAriational
Causal Effect) formula for estimating causal effects. By incorporating causal
reasoning during training, our proposed framework enhances the DQN's
understanding of the underlying causal structure of the environment, thereby
mitigating the influence of confounding factors and spurious correlations. We
demonstrate that integrating DQNs with causal capabilities significantly
enhances their problem-solving capabilities without compromising performance.
Experimental results on standard benchmark environments showcase that our
approach outperforms conventional DQNs, highlighting the effectiveness of
causal reasoning in reinforcement learning. Overall, our work presents a
promising avenue for advancing the capabilities of deep reinforcement learning
agents through principled causal inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 作者旨在提醒人们关注AI生存风险评估中线性模型的哲学局限性，特别是在认知无差异情境下，结构关系对灾难概率P(D)的影响可能被低估。

Method: 首先比较标准瑞士奶酪模型与作者使用的模型差异，然后论证在认知无差异情况下P(D)概率高于预期，最后区分风险与不确定性，指出P(D)估计受到选项不确定性和状态空间不确定性的结构性影响。

Result: 分析表明，将不确定性维度纳入AI生存风险的定性讨论中，可以更好地理解P(D)的可能性。

Conclusion: 在AI生存风险评估中，需要考虑结构关系和不同类型的不确定性，才能获得更准确的风险概率估计。

Abstract: This work is a commentary of the article
\href{https://doi.org/10.18716/ojs/phai/2025.2801}{AI Survival Stories: a
Taxonomic Analysis of AI Existential Risk} by Cappelen, Goldstein, and
Hawthorne. It is not just a commentary though, but a useful reminder of the
philosophical limitations of \say{linear} models of risk. The article will
focus on the model employed by the authors: first, I discuss some differences
between standard Swiss Cheese models and this one. I then argue that in a
situation of epistemic indifference the probability of P(D) is higher than what
one might first suggest, given the structural relationships between layers. I
then distinguish between risk and uncertainty, and argue that any estimation of
P(D) is structurally affected by two kinds of uncertainty: option uncertainty
and state-space uncertainty. Incorporating these dimensions of uncertainty into
our qualitative discussion on AI existential risk can provide a better
understanding of the likeliness of P(D).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业需要满足最小权限、合规性和可审计性的访问决策，传统方法难以处理自然语言策略解释。

Method: 使用Google Gemini 2.0 Flash实现六阶段推理框架：上下文解释、用户验证、数据分类、业务目的测试、合规映射和风险综合，采用早期硬策略门控和默认拒绝机制。

Result: 在14个标准案例评估中，精确决策匹配从10/14提升到13/14(92.9%)，拒绝召回率达到1.00，必须拒绝场景的误批准率降为0，功能适当性和合规性均为14/14。

Conclusion: 策略约束的LLM推理结合显式门控和审计跟踪，能够将人类可读策略转化为安全、合规且可追踪的机器决策。

Abstract: Enterprises need access decisions that satisfy least privilege, comply with
regulations, and remain auditable. We present a policy aware controller that
uses a large language model (LLM) to interpret natural language requests
against written policies and metadata, not raw data. The system, implemented
with Google Gemini~2.0 Flash, executes a six-stage reasoning framework (context
interpretation, user validation, data classification, business purpose test,
compliance mapping, and risk synthesis) with early hard policy gates and deny
by default. It returns APPROVE, DENY, CONDITIONAL together with cited controls
and a machine readable rationale. We evaluate on fourteen canonical cases
across seven scenario families using a privacy preserving benchmark. Results
show Exact Decision Match improving from 10/14 to 13/14 (92.9\%) after applying
policy gates, DENY recall rising to 1.00, False Approval Rate on must-deny
families dropping to 0, and Functional Appropriateness and Compliance Adherence
at 14/14. Expert ratings of rationale quality are high, and median latency is
under one minute. These findings indicate that policy constrained LLM
reasoning, combined with explicit gates and audit trails, can translate human
readable policies into safe, compliant, and traceable machine decisions.

Conclusion: 人类-AI协作不确定性量化框架能有效结合人类和AI的互补优势，在不确定性量化中实现更可靠的决策，并通过在线算法适应动态变化的环境。

Abstract: AI predictive systems are increasingly embedded in decision making pipelines,
shaping high stakes choices once made solely by humans. Yet robust decisions
under uncertainty still rely on capabilities that current AI lacks: domain
knowledge not captured by data, long horizon context, and reasoning grounded in
the physical world. This gap has motivated growing efforts to design
collaborative frameworks that combine the complementary strengths of humans and
AI. This work advances this vision by identifying the fundamental principles of
Human AI collaboration within uncertainty quantification, a key component of
reliable decision making. We introduce Human AI Collaborative Uncertainty
Quantification, a framework that formalizes how an AI model can refine a human
expert's proposed prediction set with two goals: avoiding counterfactual harm,
ensuring the AI does not degrade correct human judgments, and complementarity,
enabling recovery of correct outcomes the human missed. At the population
level, we show that the optimal collaborative prediction set follows an
intuitive two threshold structure over a single score function, extending a
classical result in conformal prediction. Building on this insight, we develop
practical offline and online calibration algorithms with provable distribution
free finite sample guarantees. The online method adapts to distribution shifts,
including human behavior evolving through interaction with AI, a phenomenon we
call Human to AI Adaptation. Experiments across image classification,
regression, and text based medical decision making show that collaborative
prediction sets consistently outperform either agent alone, achieving higher
coverage and smaller set sizes across various conditions.

Abstract: This paper establishes a formal equivalence between the architectural classes
of modern agentic AI systems and the abstract machines of the Chomsky
hierarchy. We posit that the memory architecture of an AI agent is the
definitive feature determining its computational power and that it directly
maps it to a corresponding class of automaton. Specifically, we demonstrate
that simple reflex agents are equivalent to Finite Automata, hierarchical
task-decomposition agents are equivalent to Pushdown Automata, and agents
employing readable/writable memory for reflection are equivalent to TMs. This
Automata-Agent Framework provides a principled methodology for right-sizing
agent architectures to optimize computational efficiency and cost. More
critically, it creates a direct pathway to formal verification, enables the
application of mature techniques from automata theory to guarantee agent safety
and predictability. By classifying agents, we can formally delineate the
boundary between verifiable systems and those whose behavior is fundamentally
undecidable. We address the inherent probabilistic nature of LLM-based agents
by extending the framework to probabilistic automata that allow quantitative
risk analysis. The paper concludes by outlining an agenda for developing static
analysis tools and grammars for agentic frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在情感理解时，生成的情感解释常常与目标标签不一致，甚至与自身预测的情感相矛盾，这会降低系统的可靠性和用户信任。

Method: 使用情感推理验证器(ERV)和解释奖励，在不改变模型架构或需要额外视频-描述标注的情况下，引导模型生成与目标情感一致的解释。

Result: 在MAFW和DFEW数据集上显著提高了解释-预测一致性和解释情感准确性，通过实验和人工评估验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅增强了解释与预测的对齐，还使多模态大语言模型能够提供情感一致、可信赖的交互，是实现真正类人HCI系统的关键一步。

Abstract: The recent advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is
transforming human-computer interaction (HCI) from surface-level exchanges into
more nuanced and emotionally intelligent communication. To realize this shift,
emotion understanding becomes essential allowing systems to capture subtle cues
underlying user intent. Furthermore, providing faithful explanations for
predicted emotions is crucial to ensure interpretability and build user trust.
However, current MLLM-based methods often generate emotion explanations that
diverge from the target labels and sometimes even contradict their own
predicted emotions. This inconsistency poses a critical risk for
misunderstanding and erodes reliability in interactive settings. To address
this, we propose a novel approach: the Emotional Rationale Verifier (ERV) and
an Explanation Reward. Our method guides the model to produce reasoning that is
explicitly consistent with the target emotion during multimodal emotion
recognition without modifying the model architecture or requiring additional
paired video-description annotations. Our method significantly improves
faithful explanation-prediction consistency and explanation emotion accuracy on
the MAFW and DFEW datasets. Through extensive experiments and human
evaluations, we show that our approach not only enhances alignment between
explanation and prediction but also empowers MLLMs to deliver emotionally
coherent, trustworthy interactions, marking a key step toward truly human-like
HCI systems.

Result: NoRA基准为神经网络系统关系推理领域的进一步发展提供了支持。

Conclusion: 需要超越基于路径的推理方法来推动系统关系推理领域的进步。

Abstract: Designing models that can learn to reason in a systematic way is an important
and long-standing challenge. In recent years, a wide range of solutions have
been proposed for the specific case of systematic relational reasoning,
including Neuro-Symbolic approaches, variants of the Transformer architecture,
and specialised Graph Neural Networks. However, existing benchmarks for
systematic relational reasoning focus on an overly simplified setting, based on
the assumption that reasoning can be reduced to composing relational paths. In
fact, this assumption is hard-baked into the architecture of several recent
models, leading to approaches that can perform well on existing benchmarks but
are difficult to generalise to other settings. To support further progress in
the field of systematic relational reasoning with neural networks, we introduce
NoRA, a new benchmark which adds several levels of difficulty and requires
models to go beyond path-based reasoning.

Abstract: The scope of neural code intelligence is rapidly expanding beyond text-based
source code to encompass the rich visual outputs that programs generate. This
visual dimension is critical for advanced applications like flexible content
generation and precise, program-driven editing of visualizations. However,
progress has been impeded by the scarcity of high-quality multimodal code data,
a bottleneck stemming from challenges in synthesis and quality assessment. To
address these challenges, we make contributions from both a data and modeling
perspective. We first introduce a complete synthesis toolkit that leverages
reciprocal synergies between data modalities to efficiently produce a
large-scale, high-quality corpus spanning from standard charts to complex
interactive web UIs and code-driven animations. Leveraging this toolkit, we
construct JanusCode-800K, the largest multimodal code corpus to date. This
powers the training of our models, JanusCoder and JanusCoderV, which establish
a visual-programmatic interface for generating code from textual instructions,
visual inputs, or a combination of both. Our unified model is a departure from
existing approaches that build specialized models for isolated tasks. Extensive
experiments on both text-centric and vision-centric coding tasks demonstrate
the superior performance of the JanusCoder series, with our 7B to 14B scale
models approaching or even exceeding the performance of commercial models.
Furthermore, extensive analysis provides key insights into harmonizing
programmatic logic with its visual expression. Our code and checkpoints will
are available at https://github.com/InternLM/JanusCoder.

Abstract: As human machine teaming becomes central to paradigms like Industry 5.0, a
critical need arises for machines to safely and effectively interpret complex
human behaviors. A research gap currently exists between techno centric robotic
frameworks, which often lack nuanced models of human behavior, and descriptive
behavioral ontologies, which are not designed for real time, collaborative
interpretation. This paper addresses this gap by presenting OntoPret, an
ontology for the interpretation of human behavior. Grounded in cognitive
science and a modular engineering methodology, OntoPret provides a formal,
machine processable framework for classifying behaviors, including task
deviations and deceptive actions. We demonstrate its adaptability across two
distinct use cases manufacturing and gameplay and establish the semantic
foundations necessary for advanced reasoning about human intentions.

TL;DR: ReCode通过递归代码生成统一规划和行动，使LLM智能体能够在不同决策粒度间灵活切换，显著提升推理性能和数据效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实任务需要在不同粒度上做决策，人类擅长通过统一认知表示实现这一点，但现有LLM智能体缺乏这种跨粒度决策能力，因为传统方法将高级规划和低级行动严格分离。

Method: 提出ReCode范式，将规划和行动统一在单一代码表示中，将高级计划视为抽象占位函数，然后递归分解为更细粒度的子函数，直到原始行动，消除规划与行动之间的刚性边界。

Result: 大量实验表明ReCode在推理性能上显著超越先进基线，并在训练中表现出卓越的数据效率。

Conclusion: 通过递归代码生成统一规划和行动是实现通用粒度控制的有效方法。

Abstract: Real-world tasks require decisions at varying granularities, and humans excel
at this by leveraging a unified cognitive representation where planning is
fundamentally understood as a high-level form of action. However, current Large
Language Model (LLM)-based agents lack this crucial capability to operate
fluidly across decision granularities. This limitation stems from existing
paradigms that enforce a rigid separation between high-level planning and
low-level action, which impairs dynamic adaptability and limits generalization.
We propose ReCode (Recursive Code Generation), a novel paradigm that addresses
this limitation by unifying planning and action within a single code
representation. In this representation, ReCode treats high-level plans as
abstract placeholder functions, which the agent then recursively decomposes
into finer-grained sub-functions until reaching primitive actions. This
recursive approach dissolves the rigid boundary between plan and action,
enabling the agent to dynamically control its decision granularity.
Furthermore, the recursive structure inherently generates rich,
multi-granularity training data, enabling models to learn hierarchical
decision-making processes. Extensive experiments show ReCode significantly
surpasses advanced baselines in inference performance and demonstrates
exceptional data efficiency in training, validating our core insight that
unifying planning and action through recursive code generation is a powerful
and effective approach to achieving universal granularity control. The code is
available at https://github.com/FoundationAgents/ReCode.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ChatGPT发布后，公众对AI的接受度下降，对人机协作决策的需求增加，并加剧了教育、语言和性别方面的社会不平等。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究GenAI技术快速普及背景下公众对AI态度的变化，特别是ChatGPT发布前后的对比，以了解公众对AI部署的准备程度。

Method: 采用大规模两波调查（n_wave1=1514, n_wave2=1488），对瑞士代表性人口进行ChatGPT发布前后的态度对比研究。

Result: GenAI热潮显著降低了公众对AI的接受度，完全不可接受AI的比例从23%升至30%；支持纯人类决策的比例从18%升至26%；同时扩大了教育、语言和性别差距。

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了行业对公众AI部署准备度的假设，强调技术发展必须与不断变化的公众偏好保持一致的重要性。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) technologies
has led many organizations to integrate AI into their products and services,
often without considering user preferences. Yet, public attitudes toward AI
use, especially in impactful decision-making scenarios, are underexplored.
Using a large-scale two-wave survey study (n_wave1=1514, n_wave2=1488)
representative of the Swiss population, we examine shifts in public attitudes
toward AI before and after the launch of ChatGPT. We find that the GenAI boom
is significantly associated with reduced public acceptance of AI (see Figure 1)
and increased demand for human oversight in various decision-making contexts.
The proportion of respondents finding AI "not acceptable at all" increased from
23% to 30%, while support for human-only decision-making rose from 18% to 26%.
These shifts have amplified existing social inequalities in terms of widened
educational, linguistic, and gender gaps post-boom. Our findings challenge
industry assumptions about public readiness for AI deployment and highlight the
critical importance of aligning technological development with evolving public
preferences.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了MAE框架，通过多智能体自演化的方式增强LLM的推理能力，无需人类标注数据，在数学、推理和常识问答任务上平均提升4.54%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RL方法依赖人类标注数据和可验证奖励，限制了可扩展性和泛化性。自博弈RL方法需要特定环境反馈，难以扩展到通用领域。

Method: 基于单一LLM实例化三个交互智能体（提议者、求解者、评判者），应用强化学习优化行为。提议者生成问题，求解者尝试解决，评判者评估并共同演化。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct上实验，在多个基准测试中平均提升4.54%。

Conclusion: MAE是一种可扩展、数据高效的方法，能以最小的人类监督依赖增强LLM的通用推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated significant potential in
enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However,
the success of RL for LLMs heavily relies on human-curated datasets and
verifiable rewards, which limit their scalability and generality. Recent
Self-Play RL methods, inspired by the success of the paradigm in games and Go,
aim to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities without human-annotated data.
However, their methods primarily depend on a grounded environment for feedback
(e.g., a Python interpreter or a game engine); extending them to general
domains remains challenging. To address these challenges, we propose
Multi-Agent Evolve (MAE), a framework that enables LLMs to self-evolve in
solving diverse tasks, including mathematics, reasoning, and general knowledge
Q&A. The core design of MAE is based on a triplet of interacting agents
(Proposer, Solver, Judge) that are instantiated from a single LLM, and applies
reinforcement learning to optimize their behaviors. The Proposer generates
questions, the Solver attempts solutions, and the Judge evaluates both while
co-evolving. Experiments on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct demonstrate that MAE achieves
an average improvement of 4.54% on multiple benchmarks. These results highlight
MAE as a scalable, data-efficient method for enhancing the general reasoning
abilities of LLMs with minimal reliance on human-curated supervision.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ALITA-G是一个自我进化框架，通过生成、抽象和策划MCP工具，将通用代理转化为领域专家，在多个基准测试中实现性能提升并降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自我进化代理主要局限于提示重写或失败重试，需要更系统的方法来将通用代理转化为领域专家。

Method: 通过执行目标领域任务、从成功轨迹合成候选MCP、抽象为参数化基元、整合到MCP Box，并在推理时进行检索增强的MCP选择。

Result: 在GAIA验证集上达到83.03% pass@1和89.09% pass@3的新SOTA结果，同时平均每个示例的token数减少约15%。

Conclusion: ALITA-G提供了从通用能力到可重用领域特定能力的原理性路径，提高了复杂推理任务的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to perform better when
scaffolded into agents with memory, tools, and feedback. Beyond this,
self-evolving agents have emerged, but current work largely limits adaptation
to prompt rewriting or failure retries. Therefore, we present ALITA-G, a
self-evolution framework that transforms a general-purpose agent into a domain
expert by systematically generating, abstracting, and curating Model Context
Protocol (MCP) tools. In this framework, a generalist agent executes a curated
suite of target-domain tasks and synthesizes candidate MCPs from successful
trajectories. These are then abstracted to parameterized primitives and
consolidated into an MCP Box. At inference time, ALITA-G performs
retrieval-augmented MCP selection with the help of each tool's descriptions and
use cases, before executing an agent equipped with the MCP Executor. Across
several benchmarks GAIA, PathVQA, and Humanity's Last Exam, ALITA-G attains
strong gains while reducing computation costs. On GAIA validation, it achieves
83.03% pass@1 and 89.09% pass@3, establishing a new state-of-the-art result
while reducing mean tokens per example by approximately 15% relative to a
strong baseline agent. ALITA-G thus provides a principled pathway from
generalist capability to reusable, domain-specific competence, improving both
accuracy and efficiency on complex reasoning tasks.

### [408] [A Feature Engineering Approach for Business Impact-Oriented Failure Detection in Distributed Instant Payment Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21710)
*Lorenzo Porcelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于ISO 20022消息交换处理时间的特征工程方法，用于即时支付系统的异常检测和故障定位，在TIPS系统上验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监控方法无法弥合技术基础设施指标与业务流程可见性之间的差距，特别是在零停机要求的即时支付系统中。

Method: 基于连续ISO 20022消息交换的处理时间构建特征工程，创建系统状态的紧凑表示，并应用异常检测技术。

Result: 在TIPS系统上的实验评估表明，该方法能有效检测多种异常模式，提供可解释的解释，显著减少调查时间。

Conclusion: 该方法通过将特征映射到不同处理阶段，能够区分内部和外部支付系统问题，弥合分布式系统中交易状态碎片化的可观测性差距。

Abstract: Instant payment infrastructures have stringent performance requirements,
processing millions of transactions daily with zero-downtime expectations.
Traditional monitoring approaches fail to bridge the gap between technical
infrastructure metrics and business process visibility. We introduce a novel
feature engineering approach based on processing times computed between
consecutive ISO 20022 message exchanges, creating a compact representation of
system state. By applying anomaly detection to these features, we enable early
failure detection and localization, allowing incident classification.
Experimental evaluation on the TARGET Instant Payment Settlement (TIPS) system,
using both real-world incidents and controlled simulations, demonstrates the
approach's effectiveness in detecting diverse anomaly patterns and provides
inherently interpretable explanations that enable operators to understand the
business impact. By mapping features to distinct processing phases, the
resulting framework differentiates between internal and external payment system
issues, significantly reduces investigation time, and bridges observability
gaps in distributed systems where transaction state is fragmented across
multiple entities.

### [409] [Numerical Fragility in Transformers: A Layer-wise Theory for Explaining, Forecasting, and Mitigating Instability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21770)
*Jinwoo Baek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个一阶模块化理论来预测Transformer在低精度训练中的前向误差放大问题，通过三个可解释的诊断指标和LayerNorm指标来统一评估前向稳定性，并在实验中验证了这些指标的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在低精度训练时会出现前向误差放大的问题，需要理论工具来预测和诊断这种不稳定性。

Method: 开发了一阶模块化理论，推导了自注意力层的误差边界，包含三个诊断指标：分数尺度比、行向softmax敏感度和值条件数，以及残差块误差衰减和LayerNorm指标。

Result: 在Tiny-ViT/CIFAR-10上的实验表明，组合预测器能准确跟踪FP32与低精度之间的不匹配，时间序列最大值可作为早期预警信号，LayerNorm微调能有效稳定训练。

Conclusion: 该理论提供了可操作的无量纲诊断工具，能够解释自注意力的脆弱性、预测不稳定性，并指导最小侵入性的缓解措施。

Abstract: Transformers trained in low precision can suffer forward-error amplification.
We give a first-order, module-wise theory that predicts when and where errors
grow. For self-attention we derive a per-layer bound that factorizes into three
interpretable diagnostics: a score-scale ratio $\kappa_{\rm score}$, a rowwise
softmax sensitivity $\kappa_{\rm softmax}$, and value conditioning $\kappa(V)$.
We prove a residual relaxation inequality showing that residual blocks
attenuate depth-wise accumulation, and we introduce a precision- and
width-aware LayerNorm indicator $\rho_{\rm LN}$ with a matching first-order
bound in the $\epsilon$-dominated regime. These pieces yield a unified
forward-stability bound whose right-hand side is directly estimable during
training.
  On Tiny-ViT/CIFAR-10 we evaluate the bound and components. (1) The combined
predictor $\kappa_{\rm softmax},(1+\kappa_{\rm
score}),\kappa(V),|W_O|2+\kappa{\rm eff}+C_{\rm LN}$ tracks
FP32$\leftrightarrow$LP mismatches across seeds, widths, and precisions;
scaling by $\epsilon_{\rm mach}$ collapses mixed-precision points. (2) The
time-series maximum of $\kappa_{\rm softmax}$ acts as an early-warning signal,
leading error spikes by 16-24 steps (corr. 0.65-0.82; permutation
$p!\approx!10^{-3}$; Precision@K 0.89-1.00). (3) Guided by $\rho_{\rm LN}$, a
small LayerNorm-$\epsilon$ tweak targeting $\rho_\star$ gives consistent
stabilization (mean tail-loss $\downarrow\ \approx0.010$ at $\rho_\star!=!0.6$,
cap$=10^{-2}$) with negligible overhead.
  Overall, our theory supplies actionable, unitless diagnostics that (i)
explain when self-attention is fragile, (ii) forecast instability, and (iii)
motivate a minimally invasive mitigation.

### [410] [Chebyshev Moment Regularization (CMR): Condition-Number Control with Moment Shaping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21772)
*Jinwoo Baek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Chebyshev Moment Regularization (CMR)方法，通过直接优化层谱来改善深度网络的训练稳定性，显著降低条件数并提升测试精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度网络训练中，层谱条件数过大会导致梯度不稳定和训练困难，需要一种架构无关的方法来直接优化谱特性。

Method: CMR通过切比雪夫矩联合控制谱边界（使用对数条件数代理）和内部形状，采用解耦的、有上限的混合规则来保持任务梯度。

Result: 在对抗性κ-应力设置中，CMR将平均层条件数降低约10^3倍（从约3900降至约3.4），增加平均梯度幅度，并将测试精度从约10%提升至约86%。

Conclusion: 支持优化驱动的谱预调节方法：直接引导模型朝向良好条件数区域，实现稳定准确的学习。

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{Chebyshev Moment Regularization (CMR)}, a simple,
architecture-agnostic loss that directly optimizes layer spectra. CMR jointly
controls spectral edges via a log-condition proxy and shapes the interior via
Chebyshev moments, with a decoupled, capped mixing rule that preserves task
gradients. We prove strictly monotone descent for the condition proxy, bounded
moment gradients, and orthogonal invariance. In an adversarial
``$\kappa$-stress'' setting (MNIST, 15-layer MLP), \emph{compared to vanilla
training}, CMR reduces mean layer condition numbers by $\sim\!10^3$ (from
$\approx3.9\!\times\!10^3$ to $\approx3.4$ in 5 epochs), increases average
gradient magnitude, and restores test accuracy (
$\approx10\%\!\to\!\approx86\%$ ). These results support
\textbf{optimization-driven spectral preconditioning}: directly steering models
toward well-conditioned regimes for stable, accurate learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 开发机器学习模型预测术后误吸风险，识别阿片类药物剂量、手术部位和性别差异等关键影响因素


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 误吸显著影响手术患者发病率和死亡率，需要开发预测模型以实施及时预防干预

Method: 从MIMIC-IV数据库中识别826例术后误吸患者和匹配对照组，使用XGBoost、多层感知机和随机森林三种机器学习模型，并采用增强逆概率加权进行因果分析

Result: 模型AUROC达0.86，敏感性77.3%；阿片类药物最大日剂量、住院时间和患者年龄是最重要预测因子；因果分析显示阿片类药物和头颈部手术显著增加误吸风险；男性误吸风险是女性的1.5倍，阿片类药物剂量高27%

Conclusion: 机器学习模型能有效预测术后误吸风险；阿片类药物剂量和手术部位显著影响误吸风险；性别差异在阿片类药物使用和误吸率方面值得进一步研究

Abstract: Background: Aspiration, the inhalation of foreign material into the lungs,
significantly impacts surgical patient morbidity and mortality. This study
develops a machine learning (ML) model to predict postoperative aspiration,
enabling timely preventative interventions.
  Methods: From the MIMIC-IV database of over 400,000 hospital admissions, we
identified 826 surgical patients (mean age: 62, 55.7\% male) who experienced
aspiration within seven days post-surgery, along with a matched non-aspiration
cohort. Three ML models: XGBoost, Multilayer Perceptron, and Random Forest were
trained using pre-surgical hospitalization data to predict postoperative
aspiration. To investigate causation, we estimated Average Treatment Effects
(ATE) using Augmented Inverse Probability Weighting.
  Results: Our ML model achieved an AUROC of 0.86 and 77.3\% sensitivity on a
held-out test set. Maximum daily opioid dose, length of stay, and patient age
emerged as the most important predictors. ATE analysis identified significant
causative factors: opioids (0.25 +/- 0.06) and operative site (neck: 0.20 +/-
0.13, head: 0.19 +/- 0.13). Despite equal surgery rates across genders, men
were 1.5 times more likely to aspirate and received 27\% higher maximum daily
opioid dosages compared to women.
  Conclusion: ML models can effectively predict postoperative aspiration risk,
enabling targeted preventative measures. Maximum daily opioid dosage and
operative site significantly influence aspiration risk. The gender disparity in
both opioid administration and aspiration rates warrants further investigation.
These findings have important implications for improving postoperative care
protocols and aspiration prevention strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在需要多个专家协作的场景中，如何动态聚合专家输出以获得最优结果是一个重要问题，特别是在在线学习环境下需要高效探索和利用专家能力。

Method: 提出两种算法：1）结合聚合投票与UCB驱动的连续消除算法，有效剪枝次优探索动作；2）在线加权多数投票机制，根据专家预测能力分配投票权重。

Result: 在理想情况下推导了bandit设置中的遗憾理论保证，并提供了相应的实证结果。应用于大语言模型在线微调，动态重新加权专家集和选择最优专家委员会。

Conclusion: 这些方法为组合多个专家提供了新的方法论和无遗憾保证，能够提升聚合模型的整体性能。

Abstract: We explore the use of expert-guided bandit learning, which we refer to as
online mixture-of-experts (OMoE). In this setting, given a context, a candidate
committee of experts must determine how to aggregate their outputs to achieve
optimal results in terms of aggregate accuracy. We propose two algorithms to
address this problem. The first algorithm combines aggregate voting with
UCB-driven successive elimination, efficiently pruning suboptimal exploration
actions. The second algorithm employs an online weighted-majority-voting
mechanism, leveraging the respective voting power of each expert proportional
to their predictive power. We derive theoretical guarantees for the regret
properties in the bandit setting under ideal circumstances, and empirical
results are provided accordingly. As a modern study on applications, these
methods are applied to the online fine-tuning of a set of expert large language
models (LLMs), where after each response, the generative LLM dynamically
reweighs its set of experts and/or selects the optimal committee of experts to
generate the most accurate response. Our results introduce new methodologies
and no-regret guarantees for combining multiple experts to improve on the
performance of the an aggregate model overall.

TL;DR: 提出一种新的方差减少引导(VRG)方法，通过统计测量预测误差并搜索新的采样轨迹来提升扩散模型生成质量，无需模型微调或修改。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在采样过程中存在预测误差累积问题，这会降低生成质量。需要一种无需修改模型就能减少这种误差的方法。

Method: 提出VRG方法，统计测量预测误差，在保持采样步数不变的情况下搜索新的采样轨迹，适用于条件和非条件生成。

Result: 在多个数据集和基线模型上的实验表明，VRG能显著提升扩散模型的生成质量。

Conclusion: VRG是一种有效的扩散模型采样优化方法，能减少预测误差累积，提高生成质量，且无需模型修改。

Abstract: Diffusion models have become emerging generative models. Their sampling
process involves multiple steps, and in each step the models predict the noise
from a noisy sample. When the models make prediction, the output deviates from
the ground truth, and we call such a deviation as \textit{prediction error}.
The prediction error accumulates over the sampling process and deteriorates
generation quality. This paper introduces a novel technique for statistically
measuring the prediction error and proposes the Variance-Reduction Guidance
(VRG) method to mitigate this error. VRG does not require model fine-tuning or
modification. Given a predefined sampling trajectory, it searches for a new
trajectory which has the same number of sampling steps but produces higher
quality results. VRG is applicable to both conditional and unconditional
generation. Experiments on various datasets and baselines demonstrate that VRG
can significantly improve the generation quality of diffusion models. Source

TL;DR: PCC-MJO是一个深度学习框架，作为通用后处理器来修正MJO动力模型预测，通过两阶段模型提升预测技能，将有效预测范围延长2-8天。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MJO是全球天气和气候极端事件的重要驱动因素，但在业务动力模型中的预测仍然具有挑战性，通常有效预测仅限于3-4周。

Method: 两阶段模型：首先使用物理信息3D U-Net修正时空场误差，然后使用针对预测技能优化的LSTM细化MJO的RMM指数。

Result: 应用于CMA、ECMWF和NCEP三个不同业务预报时，统一框架将有效预测范围（双变量相关>0.5）一致延长2-8天，有效缓解了"海洋大陆障碍"。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了一条物理一致、计算高效且高度可推广的途径，突破了次季节预报中长期存在的障碍。

Abstract: The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is an important driver of global weather
and climate extremes, but its prediction in operational dynamical models
remains challenging, with skillful forecasts typically limited to 3-4 weeks.
Here, we introduce a novel deep learning framework, the Physics-guided Cascaded
Corrector for MJO (PCC-MJO), which acts as a universal post-processor to
correct MJO forecasts from dynamical models. This two-stage model first employs
a physics-informed 3D U-Net to correct spatial-temporal field errors, then
refines the MJO's RMM index using an LSTM optimized for forecast skill. When
applied to three different operational forecasts from CMA, ECMWF and NCEP, our
unified framework consistently extends the skillful forecast range (bivariate
correlation > 0.5) by 2-8 days. Crucially, the model effectively mitigates the
"Maritime Continent barrier", enabling more realistic eastward propagation and
amplitude. Explainable AI analysis quantitatively confirms that the model's
decision-making is spatially congruent with observed MJO dynamics (correlation
> 0.93), demonstrating that it learns physically meaningful features rather
than statistical fittings. Our work provides a promising physically consistent,
computationally efficient, and highly generalizable pathway to break through
longstanding barriers in subseasonal forecasting.

Conclusion: 扩散模型提供了一个强大的生成建模框架，在可控生成、高效数值求解器和扩散激发的流映射模型等方面具有广泛应用前景，为读者提供了概念性和数学基础的理解。

Abstract: This monograph presents the core principles that have guided the development
of diffusion models, tracing their origins and showing how diverse formulations
arise from shared mathematical ideas. Diffusion modeling starts by defining a
forward process that gradually corrupts data into noise, linking the data
distribution to a simple prior through a continuum of intermediate
distributions. The goal is to learn a reverse process that transforms noise
back into data while recovering the same intermediates. We describe three
complementary views. The variational view, inspired by variational
autoencoders, sees diffusion as learning to remove noise step by step. The
score-based view, rooted in energy-based modeling, learns the gradient of the
evolving data distribution, indicating how to nudge samples toward more likely
regions. The flow-based view, related to normalizing flows, treats generation
as following a smooth path that moves samples from noise to data under a
learned velocity field. These perspectives share a common backbone: a
time-dependent velocity field whose flow transports a simple prior to the data.
Sampling then amounts to solving a differential equation that evolves noise
into data along a continuous trajectory. On this foundation, the monograph
discusses guidance for controllable generation, efficient numerical solvers,
and diffusion-motivated flow-map models that learn direct mappings between
arbitrary times. It provides a conceptual and mathematically grounded
understanding of diffusion models for readers with basic deep-learning
knowledge.

Motivation: 当前主流方法主要关注架构修改和优化策略，但缺乏对模态间不平衡程度的定量分析，这限制了多模态学习的性能提升。

Method: 定义模态差距作为不同模态对真实类别预测的Softmax分数差异，使用双峰高斯混合模型建模其分布，识别平衡和不平衡样本，并设计三目标自适应损失函数，采用两阶段训练策略。

Conclusion: 提出的定量分析方法和自适应损失函数能有效解决多模态不平衡问题，显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Current mainstream approaches to addressing multimodal imbalance primarily
focus on architectural modifications and optimization-based, often overlooking
a quantitative analysis of the imbalance degree between modalities. To address
this gap, our work introduces a novel method for the quantitative analysis of
multi-modal imbalance, which in turn informs the design of a sample-level
adaptive loss function.We begin by defining the "Modality Gap" as the
difference between the Softmax scores of different modalities (e.g., audio and
visual) for the ground-truth class prediction. Analysis of the Modality Gap
distribution reveals that it can be effectively modeled by a bimodal Gaussian
Mixture Model (GMM). These two components are found to correspond respectively
to "modality-balanced" and "modality-imbalanced" data samples. Subsequently, we
apply Bayes' theorem to compute the posterior probability of each sample
belonging to these two distinct distributions.Informed by this quantitative
analysis, we design a novel adaptive loss function with three objectives: (1)
to minimize the overall Modality Gap; (2) to encourage the imbalanced sample
distribution to shift towards the balanced one; and (3) to apply greater
penalty weights to imbalanced samples. We employ a two-stage training strategy
consisting of a warm-up phase followed by an adaptive training
phase.Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the public CREMA-D and AVE datasets,
attaining accuracies of $80.65\%$ and $70.90\%$, respectively. This validates
the effectiveness of our proposed methodology.

TL;DR: MARS-M是一种新的优化器，将MARS的方差缩减技术与Muon矩阵预处理器结合，在语言建模和计算机视觉任务中实现了更低的损失和更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 矩阵预处理器优化器（如Muon）在大规模神经网络训练中比标量优化器更高效，而方差缩减技术（如MARS）能显著加速LLM预训练。本文旨在结合两者的优势。

Method: 提出MARS-M优化器，将MARS的方差缩减技术与Muon矩阵预处理器集成。

Result: 理论证明MARS-M以$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/3})$的速率收敛到一阶驻点，优于Muon的$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/4})$速率。实验显示在语言建模和计算机视觉任务中，MARS-M能持续产生更低的损失并在各种下游基准测试中表现更好。

Conclusion: MARS-M成功结合了矩阵预处理器和方差缩减技术的优势，在理论和实验上都表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Matrix-based preconditioned optimizers, such as Muon, have recently been
shown to be more efficient than scalar-based optimizers for training
large-scale neural networks, including large language models (LLMs). On the
other hand, recent benchmarks on optimizers for LLM pre-training have
demonstrated that variance-reduction techniques such as MARS can achieve
substantial speedups over standard optimizers that do not employ variance
reduction. In this paper, to achieve the best of both worlds, we introduce
MARS-M, a new optimizer that integrates the variance reduction technique in
MARS with Muon. Under standard regularity conditions, we prove that Muon-M
converges to a first-order stationary point at a rate of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/3})$, which improves upon
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/4})$ rate attained by Muon. Our empirical results on
language modeling and computer vision tasks demonstrate that MARS-M
consistently yields lower losses and improved performance across various
downstream benchmarks. The implementation of MARS-M is available at

TL;DR: XRePIT是一种新颖的混合模拟策略，将机器学习加速与基于求解器的校正相结合，实现了稳定、自动化的流体动力学模拟，在保持高物理保真度的同时获得高达4.98倍的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纯数据驱动的流体动力学代理模型经常因误差累积而失败，而现有的混合方法缺乏自动化性和鲁棒性，无法实际应用。需要开发一种既稳定又实用的混合模拟方法。

Method: 开发了XRePIT混合模拟策略，将机器学习加速与基于求解器的校正协同结合，设计为完全自动化和物理感知的，确保稳定性和实际适用性。

Result: 该方法克服了长期存在的障碍，首次实现了超过10,000个时间步的稳定加速模拟，能够鲁棒地泛化到未见过的边界条件，并扩展到3D流动。实现了高达4.98倍的加速，同时保持高物理保真度，热场相对误差约为1E-3，低幅度速度动力学误差低于1E-2 ms-1。

Conclusion: 这项工作建立了一个成熟且可扩展的混合方法，为其在现实工程中的应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Purely data-driven surrogates for fluid dynamics often fail catastrophically
from error accumulation, while existing hybrid methods have lacked the
automation and robustness for practical use. To solve this, we developed
XRePIT, a novel hybrid simulation strategy that synergizes machine learning
(ML) acceleration with solver-based correction. We specifically designed our
method to be fully automated and physics-aware, ensuring the stability and
practical applicability that previous approaches lacked. We demonstrate that
this new design overcomes long-standing barriers, achieving the first stable,
accelerated rollouts for over 10,000 timesteps. The method also generalizes
robustly to unseen boundary conditions and, crucially, scales to 3D flows. Our
approach delivers speedups up to 4.98$\times$ while maintaining high physical
fidelity, resolving thermal fields with relative errors of ~1E-3 and capturing
low magnitude velocity dynamics with errors below 1E-2 ms-1. This work thus
establishes a mature and scalable hybrid method, paving the way for its use in
real-world engineering.

*Marcelo Cerda Castillo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一种基于物理过程的坐标无关特征集，用于机场大雾的短期预测，实现了跨地理位置的零样本迁移，在相距11,650公里的不同机场都取得了良好效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机场大雾预测模型在地理泛化方面的挑战，因为传统机器学习模型依赖位置特定特征而无法跨站点迁移。

Method: 使用梯度提升分类器(XGBoost)，在智利圣地亚哥机场数据上训练，采用基于热力学和辐射过程的坐标无关特征集，并在其他机场进行零样本测试。

Result: 模型在相距11,650公里的不同机场(智利、美国、英国)都取得了0.923-0.947的AUC值，适用于辐射雾、平流雾和海洋雾等不同类型。

Conclusion: 基于物理信息的坐标无关特征工程可以产生地理可迁移的大气预测工具，模型学习到了可迁移的物理关系而非站点特定模式。

Abstract: Short-term forecasting of airport fog (visibility < 1.0 km) presents
challenges in geographic generalization because many machine learning models
rely on location-specific features and fail to transfer across sites. This
study investigates whether fundamental thermodynamic and radiative processes
can be encoded in a coordinate-free (location-independent) feature set to
enable geographic transferability. A gradient boosting classifier (XGBoost)
trained on Santiago, Chile (SCEL, 33S) data from 2002-2009 was evaluated on a
2010-2012 holdout set and under strict zero-shot tests at Puerto Montt (SCTE),
San Francisco (KSFO), and London (EGLL). The model achieved AUC values of
0.923-0.947 across distances up to 11,650 km and different fog regimes
(radiative, advective, marine). Consistent SHAP feature rankings show that
visibility persistence, solar angle, and thermal gradients dominate
predictions, suggesting the model learned transferable physical relationships
rather than site-specific patterns. Results suggest that physics-informed,
coordinate-free feature engineering can yield geographically transferable
atmospheric forecasting tools.

TL;DR: 提出了HAIN（分层注意力可解释网络），通过多级注意力机制、降维和解释驱动损失函数，在保持高精度的同时提供可解释性，在TCGA数据集上达到94.3%的分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维数据集在基因组学、医疗和金融领域的激增，需要既准确又可解释的机器学习模型。传统深度学习缺乏透明度，阻碍了在关键决策应用中的部署。

Method: HAIN架构结合多级注意力机制、降维和解释驱动损失函数，通过梯度加权注意力提供特征级可解释性，并通过基于原型的表示提供全局模型解释。

Result: 在TCGA数据集上达到94.3%的分类准确率，在透明度和解释能力方面优于SHAP和LIME等传统后处理可解释性方法，并能有效识别生物学相关的癌症生物标志物。

Conclusion: HAIN通过协调预测准确性和可解释性，推进了精准医疗和监管合规的透明AI解决方案发展。

Abstract: The proliferation of high-dimensional datasets in fields such as genomics,
healthcare, and finance has created an urgent need for machine learning models
that are both highly accurate and inherently interpretable. While traditional
deep learning approaches deliver strong predictive performance, their lack of
transparency often impedes their deployment in critical, decision-sensitive
applications. In this work, we introduce the Hierarchical Attention-based
Interpretable Network (HAIN), a novel architecture that unifies multi-level
attention mechanisms, dimensionality reduction, and explanation-driven loss
functions to deliver interpretable and robust analysis of complex biomedical
data. HAIN provides feature-level interpretability via gradientweighted
attention and offers global model explanations through prototype-based
representations. Comprehensive evaluation on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
dataset demonstrates that HAIN achieves a classification accuracy of 94.3%,
surpassing conventional post-hoc interpretability approaches such as SHAP and
LIME in both transparency and explanatory power. Furthermore, HAIN effectively
identifies biologically relevant cancer biomarkers, supporting its utility for
clinical and research applications. By harmonizing predictive accuracy with
interpretability, HAIN advances the development of transparent AI solutions for
precision medicine and regulatory compliance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文比较了多尺度Dubuc距离（MDD）与动态时间规整（DTW）在时间序列相似性度量中的表现，发现MDD在多尺度分析和避免点对点对齐方面具有优势，在多个数据集上显著优于DTW。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列是高维复杂数据对象，其高效搜索和索引一直是数据挖掘领域的长期挑战。本文旨在探索新型相似性度量MDD相对于广泛使用的DTW的比较优势和局限性。

Method: 使用MDD和DTW两种方法，通过模拟实验和UCR档案中的95个数据集进行测试，并在一个具有挑战性的真实世界分类任务中应用这两种方法。

Result: 在许多场景中，MDD显著优于DTW，性能提升明显。在真实世界分类任务中，MDD相比DTW带来了显著改进。

Conclusion: MDD在多尺度时间序列相似性度量方面具有实际应用价值，能够解决DTW在某些性能差距上的问题。

Abstract: Time series are high-dimensional and complex data objects, making their
efficient search and indexing a longstanding challenge in data mining. Building
on a recently introduced similarity measure, namely Multiscale Dubuc Distance
(MDD), this paper investigates its comparative strengths and limitations
relative to the widely used Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). MDD is novel in two key
ways: it evaluates time series similarity across multiple temporal scales and
avoids point-to-point alignment. We demonstrate that in many scenarios where
MDD outperforms DTW, the gains are substantial, and we provide a detailed
analysis of the specific performance gaps it addresses. We provide simulations,
in addition to the 95 datasets from the UCR archive, to test our hypotheses.
Finally, we apply both methods to a challenging real-world classification task
and show that MDD yields a significant improvement over DTW, underscoring its
practical utility.

TL;DR: 提出了GAPO方法，通过自适应寻找无异常值的最高密度区间，使用区间中位数替代组均值来计算优势值，解决了代码编辑中奖励分布偏斜和异常值问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界代码编辑场景中，奖励分布通常偏斜且存在不可预测的异常值，导致优势计算失真和噪声增加，现有方法如GRPO难以有效处理。

Method: GAPO为每个提示自适应寻找无异常值的最高密度区间，使用该区间中位数作为自适应Q值替代组均值进行优势计算，保持即插即用和高效率。

Result: 在9个指令调优LLM（3B-14B）和51,844个真实世界代码编辑任务上验证，GAPO在精确匹配准确率上持续优于GRPO及其变体DAPO。

Conclusion: GAPO能鲁棒处理偏斜分布，在代码编辑任务中表现优于现有方法，代码已公开。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used for post-training large language
models (LLMs) in code editing, where group-relative methods like GRPO are
popular for their critic-free, normalized advantage estimation. However, in
real-world code-editing scenarios, reward distributions are often skewed with
unpredictable outliers, leading to distorted advantage computation and
increased noise. To address this issue, we propose Group Adaptive Policy
Optimization (GAPO), which adaptively finds an outlier-free highest-density
interval (HDI) per prompt and then uses the median of that interval as an
adaptive Q to replace the group mean in advantage calculation. This adaptive Q
robustly handles skewed distributions while remaining plug-and-play and
efficient. We validate GAPO on nine instruction-tuned LLMs (3B-14B) using a
large internal dataset of 51,844 real-world, history-aware code-editing tasks
across 10 languages, demonstrating consistent improvements in exact match
accuracy over GRPO and its variant DAPO. Code is publicly available.

TL;DR: RestoreLCC是一种针对剪枝后大语言模型的性能恢复方法，通过对比激活编辑探测关键注意力头，提取丢失的激活组件并重新注入剪枝头中，实现性能补偿和恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数高效微调方法通常为密集模型设计，忽视了剪枝模型的独特特性，导致剪枝模型性能恢复效果不理想。剪枝引起的信息损失反映在注意力激活中，选择性重新引入这些信息可以显著恢复模型性能。

Method: RestoreLCC通过对比激活编辑探测关键注意力头，从激活差异中提取丢失的组件，然后将这些组件重新注入到对应的剪枝头中进行补偿和恢复。该方法兼容结构化、半结构化和非结构化剪枝方案。

Result: 大量实验表明，RestoreLCC在通用和任务特定性能恢复方面始终优于最先进的基线方法，且不损害剪枝模型的稀疏性或推理效率。

Conclusion: RestoreLCC提供了一种即插即用的剪枝模型性能恢复策略，能够在保持低成本和高效性的同时有效恢复模型性能。

Abstract: Pruning is a widely used technique to reduce the size and inference cost of
large language models (LLMs), but it often causes performance degradation. To
mitigate this, existing restoration methods typically employ
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), such as LoRA, to recover the pruned
model's performance. However, most PEFT methods are designed for dense models
and overlook the distinct properties of pruned models, often resulting in
suboptimal recovery. In this work, we propose a targeted restoration strategy
for pruned models that restores performance while preserving their low cost and
high efficiency. We observe that pruning-induced information loss is reflected
in attention activations, and selectively reintroducing components of this
information can significantly recover model performance. Based on this insight,
we introduce RestoreLCC (Restoring Pruned LLMs via Lost Component
Compensation), a plug-and-play method that contrastively probes critical
attention heads via activation editing, extracts lost components from
activation differences, and finally injects them back into the corresponding
pruned heads for compensation and recovery. RestoreLCC is compatible with
structured, semi-structured, and unstructured pruning schemes. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that RestoreLCC consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in both general and task-specific performance
recovery, without compromising the sparsity or inference efficiency of pruned
models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种端到端的多任务系统，通过单张图像生成事实准确的商品描述。采用多任务学习训练视觉编码器，并结合分层生成过程来减少事实幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动生成商品描述和名称对零售商来说劳动密集且缓慢。现有的视觉语言模型存在事实幻觉问题，且单任务模型效率低下，无法捕捉特征间的相互依赖关系。

Method: 1. 多任务学习方法：单一视觉骨干网络联合训练属性预测（颜色、下摆、领型等）和价格回归；2. 分层生成过程：将模型预测的属性嵌入提示中，输入文本解码器以提高事实一致性。

Result: 多任务方法在价格回归上R2值提升3.6%，属性分类F1分数提升6.6%。分层生成过程将事实幻觉率从12.7%降至7.1%（相对减少44.5%），自回归文本生成延迟减少3.5倍。但ROUGE-L得分比直接视觉语言模型低3.5%。

Conclusion: 该架构在减少事实幻觉和提高效率方面表现出色，多任务学习和分层生成过程有效提升了模型的准确性和一致性。

Abstract: Manually generating catchy descriptions and names is labor intensive and a
slow process for retailers. Although generative AI provides an automation
solution in form of Vision to Language Models (VLM), the current VLMs are prone
to factual "hallucinations". Siloed, single task models are not only
inefficient but also fail to capture interdependent relationships between
features. To address these challenges, we propose an end to end, multi task
system that generates factually grounded textual listings from a single image.
The contributions of this study are two proposals for the model architecture.
First, application of multi task learning approach for fine tuning a vision
encoder where a single vision backbone is jointly trained on attribute
prediction such as color, hemline and neck style and price regression. Second,
introduction of a hierarchical generation process where the model's own
predicted attributes are embedded in a prompt and fed to the text decoder to
improve factual consistency. The experiments demonstrate the superiority of
this architecture. The multi tasking approach outperforms both the independent
price regression, with a 3.6% better R2 Value and attribute classification,
with a 6.6% improvement F1 score. Critically, the hierarchical generation
process proves highly effective, slashing the factual hallucination rate from
12.7% to 7.1%, a 44.5% relative reduction, compared to a non hierarchical
ablation. The hierarchical approach also reduces the latency of the
autoregressive text generation process by a factor of 3.5 when compared to
direct vision to language model of similar size. One minor caveat is that the
model does perform 3.5% worse than direct vision-to-language model on ROUGE-L
score.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在持续学习中面临灾难性遗忘问题，且频繁重新训练成本高昂，需要一种高效的方法来学习新任务而不忘记已有知识。

Method: 使用自编码器学习各种任务权重的低维嵌入表示，促进知识向新任务的迁移，同时防止灾难性遗忘。

Result: 在不同数据集上的实验表明，COLA不仅克服了灾难性遗忘，还显著减少了参数使用和内存占用，在多个任务上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: COLA框架使大语言模型能够高效学习新任务，对先前任务的性能退化极小，且无需保留早期训练数据。

Abstract: Learning a set of tasks over time, also known as continual learning (CL), is
one of the most challenging problems in artificial intelligence due to
catastrophic forgetting. Large language models (LLMs) are often impractical to
frequent re-training and continual learning , due to high cost of computational
resources for training. Moreover, LLM are not suitable for continual learning
as updating these models over time for acquiring new knowledge leads to
overwrites existing knowledge leading to common phenomenon know as
\textit{catastrophic forgetting}. In this paper, we aim to address these
concerns using a novel framework , COLA that employs an autoencoder to learn
capture low-dimensional embeddings of the weights associated with various
tasks. Our approach facilitates the transfer of knowledge to new tasks while
preventing catastrophic forgetting, all without using data replay or a
substantial set of task-specific parameters. Our approach, COLA, makes the LLM
efficiently learn new tasks with minimal training, insignificant performance
degradation on previous tasks, and eliminates the need for retaining earlier
training data. Empirical evaluation on different datasets ranging from task
oriented dialouge system to intent classsfication datasets showcases that our
method not only overcomes catastrophic forgetting but also achieves significant
reduction in parameter usage and memory size, across multiple tasks and
outperforming the existing state of the art methods across multiple datasets.

TL;DR: KARIPAP是一种量子启发的张量网络压缩方法，使用无限投影纠缠对态(iPEPS)和张量重整化群(TRG)来压缩大型语言模型，显著减少内存和参数，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的巨大参数量导致计算和环境负担严重，现有压缩方法忽略了复杂的层间相关性，需要更有效的压缩技术。

Method: 使用量子启发的iPEPS张量网络捕获注意力机制和深度transformer层中的多方向纠缠，通过TRG实现多项式时间收缩，保持关键相关几何结构。

Result: 在LLaMA-2 7B上实现93%内存减少、70%参数减少、50%训练加速、25%推理加速，仅损失2-3%准确率。层间纠缠分析显示深层存在冗余。

Conclusion: 现代LLM占据低维纠缠流形，KARIPAP证明了可扩展、节能且量子感知的AI架构的可行性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and LLaMA drive rapid progress in
generative AI, yet their huge parameter scales create severe computational and
environmental burdens. High training costs, energy use, and limited device
deployment hinder accessibility. Existing compression - pruning, distillation,
low-rank, and quantization - reduces size but ignores complex inter-layer
correlations. We propose KARIPAP, a quantum-inspired tensor network compression
using Infinite Projected Entangled Pair States (iPEPS) and Tensor
Renormalization Group (TRG) contraction. Unlike 1D Matrix Product States, iPEPS
captures multi-directional entanglement in attention and deep transformer
layers. TRG ensures polynomial-time contraction, making tensorization feasible
while preserving key correlation geometry. Experiments on LLaMA-2 7B show up to
93% memory and 70% parameter reduction, with 50% faster training, 25% faster
inference, and only 2-3% accuracy loss. Layer-wise entanglement profiling
reveals redundancy in deeper layers, confirming their suitability for tensor
factorization. KARIPAP demonstrates that modern LLMs occupy low-dimensional
entanglement manifolds, enabling scalable, energy-efficient, and quantum-aware
AI architectures.

Motivation: 现有成员推理攻击方法依赖影子模型或大量查询访问，实用性受限，需要更高效且实用的替代方案。

Method: 使用高斯过程元建模，基于单个训练模型的准确率、熵、数据集统计等后验指标，训练GP分类器来区分成员与非成员，并提供校准的不确定性估计。

Result: 在合成数据、真实欺诈检测数据、CIFAR-10和WikiText-2上的实验表明，GP-MIA实现了高准确率和良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: GP-MIA为现有成员推理攻击提供了实用的替代方案，具有高效性和可解释性。

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) test whether a data point was part of a
model's training set, posing serious privacy risks. Existing methods often
depend on shadow models or heavy query access, which limits their practicality.
We propose GP-MIA, an efficient and interpretable approach based on Gaussian
process (GP) meta-modeling. Using post-hoc metrics such as accuracy, entropy,
dataset statistics, and optional sensitivity features (e.g. gradients, NTK
measures) from a single trained model, GP-MIA trains a GP classifier to
distinguish members from non-members while providing calibrated uncertainty
estimates. Experiments on synthetic data, real-world fraud detection data,
CIFAR-10, and WikiText-2 show that GP-MIA achieves high accuracy and
generalizability, offering a practical alternative to existing MIAs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文首次将偏好优化引入降水临近预报，提出SynCast方法，使用两阶段训练框架来协同优化冲突的评估指标，解决确定性模型预测过于平滑和概率模型性能波动的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降水临近预报面临确定性模型预测过于平滑难以捕捉极端事件，概率模型性能在不同指标间波动，以及评估指标（如CSI和FAR）之间存在固有冲突的问题。

Method: 提出SynCast方法，采用Diffusion-SPO两阶段后训练框架：第一阶段专注于降低FAR，抑制误报；第二阶段在保持FAR对齐的基础上进一步优化CSI，实现冲突指标的协同改进。

Result: 通过偏好优化方法，能够协同改进冲突的评估指标，在降水临近预报中实现更优的性能表现。

Conclusion: 偏好优化方法能够有效解决降水临近预报中评估指标冲突的问题，为极端天气监测和灾害预防提供更可靠的预测支持。

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting based on radar echoes plays a crucial role in
monitoring extreme weather and supporting disaster prevention. Although deep
learning approaches have achieved significant progress, they still face notable
limitations. For example, deterministic models tend to produce over-smoothed
predictions, which struggle to capture extreme events and fine-scale
precipitation patterns. Probabilistic generative models, due to their inherent
randomness, often show fluctuating performance across different metrics and
rarely achieve consistently optimal results. Furthermore, precipitation
nowcasting is typically evaluated using multiple metrics, some of which are
inherently conflicting. For instance, there is often a trade-off between the
Critical Success Index (CSI) and the False Alarm Ratio (FAR), making it
challenging for existing models to deliver forecasts that perform well on both
metrics simultaneously. To address these challenges, we introduce preference
optimization into precipitation nowcasting for the first time, motivated by the
success of reinforcement learning from human feedback in large language models.
Specifically, we propose SynCast, a method that employs the two-stage
post-training framework of Diffusion Sequential Preference Optimization
(Diffusion-SPO), to progressively align conflicting metrics and consistently
achieve superior performance. In the first stage, the framework focuses on
reducing FAR, training the model to effectively suppress false alarms. Building
on this foundation, the second stage further optimizes CSI with constraints
that preserve FAR alignment, thereby achieving synergistic improvements across
these conflicting metrics.

Conclusion: 多语言视觉语言训练数据显著改善了跨语言泛化能力，指令调优的LLM并非总是最佳初始化点。所有模型、数据和训练方法均已公开发布以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in vision-language models (VLMs), most existing
work follows an English-centric design process, limiting their effectiveness in
multilingual settings. In this work, we provide a comprehensive empirical study
analyzing the impact of several multilingual design choices, such as training
data composition, encoder selection, and text backbones. The result is
TowerVision, a family of open multilingual VLMs for both image-text and
video-text tasks, built upon the multilingual text-only model Tower+.
TowerVision achieves competitive performance on multiple multimodal
multilingual benchmarks and shows particular strength in culturally grounded
tasks and multimodal translation. By incorporating visual and cultural context
during fine-tuning, our models surpass existing approaches trained on
substantially larger datasets, as demonstrated on ALM-Bench and Multi30K (image
tasks) and ViMUL-Bench (video tasks). Alongside the models, we release
VisionBlocks, a high-quality, curated vision-language dataset. Our findings
highlight that multilingual vision-language training data substantially
improves cross-lingual generalization -- both from high-resource to
underrepresented languages and vice versa -- and that instruction-tuned LLMs
are not always the optimal initialization point. To support further research,
we publicly release all models, data, and training recipes.

Motivation: 传统DEIM方法在投影基降阶模型中虽然能有效近似非线性项，但其固定的插值点限制了适应复杂时变动力系统的能力。

Method: 开发了可微分自适应DEIM公式，允许神经网络动态选择插值点；并将DEIM作为分析工具来检查预训练NODE模型的学习动态。

Conclusion: DEIM不仅可作为模型降阶工具，还能作为诊断框架来理解和改进神经微分方程模型的泛化行为。

Abstract: We present a differentiable framework that leverages the Discrete Empirical
Interpolation Method (DEIM) for interpretable deep learning and dynamical
system analysis. Although DEIM efficiently approximates nonlinear terms in
projection-based reduced-order models (POD-ROM), its fixed interpolation points
limit the adaptability to complex and time-varying dynamics. To address this
limitation, we first develop a differentiable adaptive DEIM formulation for the
one-dimensional viscous Burgers equation, which allows neural networks to
dynamically select interpolation points in a computationally efficient and
physically consistent manner. We then apply DEIM as an interpretable analysis
tool for examining the learned dynamics of a pre-trained Neural Ordinary
Differential Equation (NODE) on a two-dimensional vortex-merging problem. The
DEIM trajectories reveal physically meaningful features in the learned dynamics
of NODE and expose its limitations when extrapolating to unseen flow
configurations. These findings demonstrate that DEIM can serve not only as a
model reduction tool but also as a diagnostic framework for understanding and
improving the generalization behavior of neural differential equation models.

are implemented separately. Forecasting models are typically trained to
minimize forecasting errors, overlooking their impact on downstream
decision-making. To address this, decision-focused learning (DFL) has been
studied to minimize decision-making costs instead. However, practical adoption
of DFL in MES faces significant challenges: the process requires sharing
sensitive load data and model parameters across multiple sectors, raising
serious privacy issues. To this end, we propose a privacy-preserving DFL
framework tailored for MES. Our approach introduces information masking to
safeguard private data while enabling recovery of decision variables and
gradients required for model training. To further enhance security for DFL, we
design a safety protocol combining matrix decomposition and homomorphic
encryption, effectively preventing collusion and unauthorized data access.
Additionally, we developed a privacy-preserving load pattern recognition
algorithm, enabling the training of specialized DFL models for heterogeneous
load patterns. Theoretical analysis and comprehensive case studies, including
real-world MES data, demonstrate that our framework not only protects privacy
but also consistently achieves lower average daily dispatch costs compared to
existing methods.

Motivation: 现有深度学习电磁法研究使用的数据集通常来自随机一维或结构简单的三维模型，无法代表真实地质环境的复杂性，且缺乏标准化的公开三维地电数据集。

Method: 构建包含九类地电模型的大规模数据集，涵盖从简单半空间异常体到复杂结构如平层、褶皱层、平断层、曲断层及其变体。开发基于深度学习的快速正演建模方法。

Conclusion: OpenEM解决了深度学习电磁法研究中数据集质量不足和标准化缺失的问题，为电磁法深度学习的广泛应用提供了基础。

Abstract: With the remarkable success of deep learning, applying such techniques to EM
methods has emerged as a promising research direction to overcome the
limitations of conventional approaches. The effectiveness of deep learning
methods depends heavily on the quality of datasets, which directly influences
model performance and generalization ability. Existing application studies
often construct datasets from random one-dimensional or structurally simple
three-dimensional models, which fail to represent the complexity of real
geological environments. Furthermore, the absence of standardized, publicly
available three-dimensional geoelectric datasets continues to hinder progress
in deep learning based EM exploration. To address these limitations, we present
OpenEM, a large scale, multi structural three dimensional geoelectric dataset
that encompasses a broad range of geologically plausible subsurface structures.
OpenEM consists of nine categories of geoelectric models, spanning from simple
configurations with anomalous bodies in half space to more complex structures
such as flat layers, folded layers, flat faults, curved faults, and their
corresponding variants with anomalous bodies. Since three-dimensional forward
modeling in electromagnetics is extremely time-consuming, we further developed
a deep learning based fast forward modeling approach for OpenEM, enabling
efficient and reliable forward modeling across the entire dataset. This
capability allows OpenEM to be rapidly deployed for a wide range of tasks.
OpenEM provides a unified, comprehensive, and large-scale dataset for common EM
exploration systems to accelerate the application of deep learning in
electromagnetic methods. The complete dataset, along with the forward modeling
codes and trained models, is publicly available at
https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17141981.

*Bentley DeVilling*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型语言模型在没有外部反馈的递归自我评估中，信息变化会逐渐减少，趋于信息闭合状态。通过简单的验证干预可以重新引入信息流，表明自我纠正存在结构性限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试大型语言模型在无外部反馈的递归自我评估中的表现，验证其是否真正具备反思推理能力，还是仅仅进行形式上的重述。

Method: 跨提供商研究，使用三个模型（GPT-4o-mini、Claude 3 Haiku、Gemini 2.0 Flash）和四种任务类型，每个任务迭代十次，比较无基础自我批评和最小基础干预两种条件。

Result: 无基础运行中，信息变化从早期到后期下降55%；基础运行在干预后信息变化反弹28%并保持非零方差。所有模型都显示相同模式：无接触的反思趋于信息闭合。

Conclusion: 生成式推理中的自我纠正存在结构性限制，没有独立验证者的信息交换，递归推理会趋于认知停滞状态。最小基础干预可作为耗散耦合重新引入信息流。

Abstract: Large language models are often described as capable of reflective reasoning,
yet recursive self-evaluation without external feedback frequently yields
reformulation rather than progress. We test this prediction in a cross-provider
study of 144 reasoning sequences across three models (OpenAI GPT-4o-mini,
Anthropic Claude 3 Haiku, and Google Gemini 2.0 Flash) and four task families
(arithmetic, code, explanation, reflection), each iterated ten times under two
conditions: ungrounded self-critique and a minimal grounding intervention (a
single verification step at iteration three). Mean informational change (delta
I, measured via normalized edit distance) declined by 55% from early (0.193) to
late (0.087) iterations in ungrounded runs, with consistent patterns across all
three providers. Grounded runs showed a +28% rebound in informational change
immediately after the intervention and sustained non-zero variance thereafter.
Complementary measures-n-gram novelty, embedding drift, and character-level
entropy-converged on the same pattern: reflection without contact tends toward
informational closure. We interpret this as evidence for a structural limit on
self-correction in generative reasoning: without an exchange of information
with an independent verifier or environment, recursive inference approaches an
attractor state of epistemic stasis. Minimal grounding functions as dissipative
coupling, reintroducing informational flux. The cross-architecture consistency
suggests the mirror loop arises from shared autoregressive training objectives
rather than provider-specific alignment schemes. The results delineate when
reflection is performative rather than epistemic and motivate design principles
for grounded, cooperative reasoning. Materials and code are publicly available.

Conclusion: 所提出的框架具有通用性，允许组合和调整其他线性判别嵌入方法，实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: The performance of machine learning and pattern recognition algorithms
generally depends on data representation. That is why, much of the current
effort in performing machine learning algorithms goes into the design of
preprocessing frameworks and data transformations able to support effective
machine learning. The method proposed in this work consists of a hybrid linear
feature extraction scheme to be used in supervised multi-class classification
problems. Inspired by two recent linear discriminant methods: robust sparse
linear discriminant analysis (RSLDA) and inter-class sparsitybased
discriminative least square regression (ICS_DLSR), we propose a unifying
criterion that is able to retain the advantages of these two powerful methods.
The resulting transformation relies on sparsity-promoting techniques both to
select the features that most accurately represent the data and to preserve the
row-sparsity consistency property of samples from the same class. The linear
transformation and the orthogonal matrix are estimated using an iterative
alternating minimization scheme based on steepest descent gradient method and
different initialization schemes. The proposed framework is generic in the
sense that it allows the combination and tuning of other linear discriminant
embedding methods. According to the experiments conducted on several datasets
including faces, objects, and digits, the proposed method was able to
outperform competing methods in most cases.

Conclusion: 对抗技能组合训练是防御新型越狱攻击的有效方法，验证了对抗性似曾相识假设，为AI安全提供了新范式。

Abstract: Large language models remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that bypass
safety guardrails to elicit harmful outputs. Defending against novel jailbreaks
represents a critical challenge in AI safety. Adversarial training -- designed
to make models robust against worst-case perturbations -- has been the dominant
paradigm for adversarial robustness. However, due to optimization challenges
and difficulties in defining realistic threat models, adversarial training
methods often fail on newly developed jailbreaks in practice. This paper
proposes a new paradigm for improving robustness against unseen jailbreaks,
centered on the Adversarial D\'ej\`a Vu hypothesis: novel jailbreaks are not
fundamentally new, but largely recombinations of adversarial skills from
previous attacks. We study this hypothesis through a large-scale analysis of 32
attack papers published over two years. Using an automated pipeline, we extract
and compress adversarial skills into a sparse dictionary of primitives, with
LLMs generating human-readable descriptions. Our analysis reveals that unseen
attacks can be effectively explained as sparse compositions of earlier skills,
with explanatory power increasing monotonically as skill coverage grows. Guided
by this insight, we introduce Adversarial Skill Compositional Training (ASCoT),
which trains on diverse compositions of skill primitives rather than isolated
attack instances. ASCoT substantially improves robustness to unseen attacks,
including multi-turn jailbreaks, while maintaining low over-refusal rates. We
also demonstrate that expanding adversarial skill coverage, not just data
scale, is key to defending against novel attacks.

Motivation: 电子健康记录数据为优化风险评分工具提供了机会，但面临两个挑战：干预审查结果导致的部分监督问题，以及随序数距离增加的不对称误分类成本。

Method: 使用混合整数规划框架联合优化评分权重和类别阈值，通过每个实例的可行标签集处理部分监督，采用不对称距离感知目标，并通过最小阈值间隙防止中间类别崩溃。

Result: 开发了使用softplus损失的CSO松弛方法，在保持序数结构的同时实现高效优化，支持符号限制、稀疏性和对现有工具的最小修改等治理约束。

Conclusion: 该框架能够在临床工作流程中实际部署，有效优化医疗风险评分工具。

Abstract: Risk assessment tools in healthcare commonly employ point-based scoring
systems that map patients to ordinal risk categories via thresholds. While
electronic health record (EHR) data presents opportunities for data-driven
optimization of these tools, two fundamental challenges impede standard
supervised learning: (1) partial supervision arising from intervention-censored
outcomes, where only extreme categories can be reliably labeled, and (2)
asymmetric misclassification costs that increase with ordinal distance. We
propose a mixed-integer programming (MIP) framework that jointly optimizes
scoring weights and category thresholds under these constraints. Our approach
handles partial supervision through per-instance feasible label sets,
incorporates asymmetric distance-aware objectives, and prevents middle-category
collapse via minimum threshold gaps. We further develop a CSO relaxation using
softplus losses that preserves the ordinal structure while enabling efficient
optimization. The framework supports governance constraints including sign
restrictions, sparsity, and minimal modifications to incumbent tools, ensuring
practical deployability in clinical workflows.

Abstract: Novelty detection in large scientific datasets faces two key challenges: the
noisy and high-dimensional nature of experimental data, and the necessity of
making statistically robust statements about any observed outliers. While there
is a wealth of literature on anomaly detection via dimensionality reduction,
most methods do not produce outputs compatible with quantifiable claims of
scientific discovery. In this work we directly address these challenges,
presenting the first step towards a unified pipeline for novelty detection
adapted for the rigorous statistical demands of science. We introduce
AutoSciDACT (Automated Scientific Discovery with Anomalous Contrastive
Testing), a general-purpose pipeline for detecting novelty in scientific data.
AutoSciDACT begins by creating expressive low-dimensional data representations
using a contrastive pre-training, leveraging the abundance of high-quality
simulated data in many scientific domains alongside expertise that can guide
principled data augmentation strategies. These compact embeddings then enable
an extremely sensitive machine learning-based two-sample test using the New
Physics Learning Machine (NPLM) framework, which identifies and statistically
quantifies deviations in observed data relative to a reference distribution
(null hypothesis). We perform experiments across a range of astronomical,
physical, biological, image, and synthetic datasets, demonstrating strong
sensitivity to small injections of anomalous data across all domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最近文献观察到神经网络存在瓶颈秩特性：随着深度增加，基于梯度方法训练的神经网络激活和权重往往呈现近似低秩。本文旨在研究这一现象对泛化能力的影响。

Method: 通过分析权重矩阵的Schatten p拟范数来推导泛化界，利用神经网络权重矩阵的近似低秩结构。

Result: 证明了基于权重矩阵Schatten p拟范数的泛化界，当p较小时，样本复杂度为O(WrL^2)，其中W为宽度，L为深度，r为权重矩阵的秩。随着p增大，边界表现更像基于范数的边界。

Conclusion: 神经网络中的瓶颈秩现象可以用于推导改进的泛化界，通过利用权重矩阵的近似低秩结构，可以获得比传统范数边界更紧的泛化保证。

Abstract: It has been recently observed in much of the literature that neural networks
exhibit a bottleneck rank property: for larger depths, the activation and
weights of neural networks trained with gradient-based methods tend to be of
approximately low rank. In fact, the rank of the activations of each layer
converges to a fixed value referred to as the ``bottleneck rank'', which is the
minimum rank required to represent the training data. This perspective is in
line with the observation that regularizing linear networks (without
activations) with weight decay is equivalent to minimizing the Schatten $p$
quasi norm of the neural network. In this paper we investigate the implications
of this phenomenon for generalization. More specifically, we prove
generalization bounds for neural networks which exploit the approximate low
rank structure of the weight matrices if present. The final results rely on the
Schatten $p$ quasi norms of the weight matrices: for small $p$, the bounds
exhibit a sample complexity $ \widetilde{O}(WrL^2)$ where $W$ and $L$ are the
width and depth of the neural network respectively and where $r$ is the rank of
the weight matrices. As $p$ increases, the bound behaves more like a norm-based
bound instead.

Abstract: Spectral decomposition of linear operators plays a central role in many areas
of machine learning and scientific computing. Recent work has explored training
neural networks to approximate eigenfunctions of such operators, enabling
scalable approaches to representation learning, dynamical systems, and partial
differential equations (PDEs). In this paper, we revisit a classical
optimization framework from the computational physics literature known as the
\emph{orbital minimization method} (OMM), originally proposed in the 1990s for
solving eigenvalue problems in computational chemistry. We provide a simple
linear-algebraic proof of the consistency of the OMM objective, and reveal
connections between this method and several ideas that have appeared
independently across different domains. Our primary goal is to justify its
broader applicability in modern learning pipelines. We adapt this framework to
train neural networks to decompose positive semidefinite operators, and
demonstrate its practical advantages across a range of benchmark tasks. Our
results highlight how revisiting classical numerical methods through the lens
of modern theory and computation can provide not only a principled approach for
deploying neural networks in numerical simulation, but also effective and
scalable tools for machine learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer架构中的常规注意力机制具有O(N²D)的时间复杂度，而线性注意力虽然理论上有O(ND²)的线性复杂度，但在实践中效率落后于理论。需要改进线性注意力的实际运行效率。

Method: 提出了线性注意力的新型前向和后向传播方法，并开发了高度优化的CUDA实现，显著提升了计算效率和内存使用效率。

Result: 在单层和端到端设置中验证，速度比现有技术快3.3倍，内存消耗减少3.6倍。训练的14亿参数语言模型在主要推理基准测试中表现出与常规注意力相似的表达能力。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了线性注意力的实际效率，使其在保持表达能力的同时实现了理论上的线性复杂度优势，为Transformer的高效训练和推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The original softmax-based attention mechanism (regular attention) in the
extremely successful Transformer architecture computes attention between $N$
tokens, each embedded in a $D$-dimensional head, with a time complexity of
$O(N^2D)$. Given the success of Transformers, improving their runtime during
both training and inference is a popular research area. One such approach is
the introduction of the linear attention (LA) mechanisms, which offers a linear
time complexity of $O(ND^2)$ and have demonstrated comparable accuracy to
regular attention. However, LA in practice lags behind its theoretical
efficiency. We propose a novel method for LA's forward and backward passes,
along with a highly-optimized CUDA implementation. Our approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art by 3.3 times in speed and reduces memory consumption by 3.6
times. We validate these improvements in both single-layer and end-to-end
settings by training a 1.4 billion parameter language model, which demonstrates
similar expressivity to regular attention on major reasoning benchmarks.

TL;DR: PUNT是一种模型无关的采样器，通过识别token依赖关系并移除低置信度token来解决并行采样中的条件独立性与高置信度预测之间的冲突，在保持准确性的同时提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 掩码扩散模型（MDMs）相比自回归模型（ARMs）能够实现并行token采样，从而获得更快的推理速度。但并行采样面临两个相互冲突的要求：同时更新的token必须条件独立，同时更新应优先考虑高置信度预测。

Method: PUNT通过识别token依赖关系，从冲突组中移除低置信度token，生成满足独立性和置信度标准的索引集，通过近似条件独立性测试确保改进的并行解掩码。

Result: 在IFEval基准测试中，PUNT相比基线方法（包括顺序生成）准确率提升高达16%，在生成长序列时表现尤为突出，且对超参数不敏感。

Conclusion: PUNT在准确性和计算效率之间实现了优越的权衡，并诱导出层次化生成策略，模型先建立高级段落结构再进行局部细化，表现出类似规划的生成过程，有助于强对齐性能。

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) offer a compelling alternative to
autoregressive models (ARMs) for discrete text generation because they enable
parallel token sampling, rather than sequential, left-to-right generation. This
means potentially much faster inference. However, effective parallel sampling
faces two competing requirements: (i) simultaneously updated tokens must be
conditionally independent, and (ii) updates should prioritise high-confidence
predictions. These goals conflict because high-confidence predictions often
cluster and depend on each other, opportunities for parallel updates.
  We present PUNT, a model-agnostic sampler that reconciles this trade-off. Our
method identifies token dependencies and removes lower-confidence tokens from
conflicting groups. This produces sets of indices for unmasking that satisfy
both independence and confidence criteria. Our approach ensures improved
parallel unmasking through approximate conditional independence testing.
  Our experiments show that PUNT delivers a superior trade-off between accuracy
and compute when compared to other strong training-free baselines, especially
for generation of longer sequences. On the IFEval benchmark, it achieves up to
16\% higher accuracy over baseline methods, including sequential generation
(one-by-one). These gains hold across different values of hyperparameters,
mitigating the need for brittle hyperparameter tuning. Moreover, we observe
that PUNT induces an emergent hierarchical generation strategy, where the model
first establishes high-level paragraph structure before local refinement,
suggesting a planning-like generation process that contributes to strong
alignment performance.

Motivation: 传统Jump Gaussian Processes在高维输入空间中存在局限性，需要开发能够有效处理高维分段连续函数的方法。

Method: DJGP在JGP基础上添加局部线性投影层，使用区域特定矩阵捕捉局部子空间结构，并在投影矩阵上放置高斯过程先验以控制模型复杂度，最后用JGP对投影输入建模。

Conclusion: DJGP通过结合局部投影和JGP建模，成功解决了高维分段连续函数的代理建模问题，提供了更好的预测性能和不确定性估计。

Abstract: We introduce Deep Jump Gaussian Processes (DJGP), a novel method for
surrogate modeling of high-dimensional piecewise continuous functions. DJGP
overcomes the limitations of conventional Jump Gaussian Processes in
high-dimensional input spaces by adding a locally linear projection layer to
Jump Gaussian Processes. This projection uses region-specific matrices to
capture local subspace structures, naturally complementing the localized nature
of JGP, a variant of local Gaussian Processes. To control model complexity, we
place a Gaussian Process prior on the projection matrices, allowing them to
evolve smoothly across the input space. The projected inputs are then modeled
with a JGP to capture piecewise continuous relationships with the response.
This yields a distinctive two-layer deep learning of GP/JGP. We further develop
a scalable variational inference algorithm to jointly learn the projection
matrices and JGP hyperparameters. Experiments on synthetic and benchmark
datasets demonstrate that DJGP delivers superior predictive accuracy and more
reliable uncertainty quantification compared to existing approaches.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR训练虽然提升了推理能力，但会导致模型基础能力（如感知和忠实性）退化，现有正则化方法无法保证广泛知识保留。

Method: 提出RECAP方法，使用动态目标重加权机制，基于收敛和不稳定性信号在线调整训练焦点，从饱和目标转向表现不佳或波动的目标。

Conclusion: RECAP是一种端到端的重放策略，无需额外模型训练或大量调参即可应用于现有RLVR流程，有效解决能力退化问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has delivered
impressive gains in mathematical and multimodal reasoning and has become a
standard post-training paradigm for contemporary language and vision-language
models. However, the RLVR recipe introduces a significant risk of capability
regression, where models forget foundational skills after prolonged training
without employing regularization strategies. We empirically confirm this
concern, observing that open-source reasoning models suffer performance
degradation on core capabilities such as perception and faithfulness. While
imposing regularization terms like KL divergence can help prevent deviation
from the base model, these terms are calculated on the current task, thus they
do not guarantee broader knowledge. Meanwhile, commonly used experience replay
across heterogeneous domains makes it nontrivial to decide how much training
focus each objective should receive. To address this, we propose RECAP-a replay
strategy with dynamic objective reweighting for general knowledge preservation.
Our reweighting mechanism adapts in an online manner using short-horizon
signals of convergence and instability, shifting the post-training focus away
from saturated objectives and toward underperforming or volatile ones. Our
method is end-to-end and readily applicable to existing RLVR pipelines without
training additional models or heavy tuning. Extensive experiments on benchmarks
based on Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method, which not only preserves general capabilities but also improves
reasoning by enabling more flexible trade-offs among in-task rewards.

Abstract: Machine-learning methods in biochemistry commonly represent molecules as
graphs of pairwise intermolecular interactions for property and structure
predictions. Most methods operate on a single graph, typically the minimal free
energy (MFE) structure, for low-energy ensembles (conformations) representative
of structures at thermodynamic equilibrium. We introduce a thermodynamically
parameterized exponential-family random graph (ERGM) embedding that models
molecules as Boltzmann-weighted ensembles of interaction graphs. We evaluate
this embedding on SELEX datasets, where experimental biases (e.g., PCR
amplification or sequencing noise) can obscure true aptamer-ligand affinity,
producing anomalous candidates whose observed abundance diverges from their
actual binding strength. We show that the proposed embedding enables robust
community detection and subgraph-level explanations for aptamer ligand
affinity, even in the presence of biased observations. This approach may be
used to identify low-abundance aptamer candidates for further experimental
evaluation.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a central tool for learning on
graph-structured data, yet their applicability to real-world systems remains
limited by key challenges such as scalability, temporality, directionality,
data incompleteness, and structural uncertainty. This thesis introduces a
series of models addressing these limitations: SIGN for scalable graph
learning, TGN for temporal graphs, Dir-GNN for directed and heterophilic
networks, Feature Propagation (FP) for learning with missing node features, and
NuGget for game-theoretic structural inference. Together, these contributions
bridge the gap between academic benchmarks and industrial-scale graphs,
enabling the use of GNNs in domains such as social and recommender systems.

*Michał Bortkiewicz,Władysław Pałucki,Mateusz Ostaszewski,Benjamin Eysenbach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文通过实证研究发现，蒙特卡洛方法也能实现经验拼接，虽然时序差分方法表现略好，但差距远小于神经网络规模带来的提升。研究挑战了传统认为只有TD方法能实现经验拼接的观点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为只有时序差分方法能实现经验拼接，而蒙特卡洛方法不能。但在函数逼近的实际应用中，轨迹很少相交，这种传统观点是否成立值得研究。

Method: 通过实证研究比较MC和TD方法在函数逼近设置下的表现，分析神经网络规模对经验拼接能力的影响。

Result: MC方法也能实现经验拼接，TD方法优势有限。增加评论家网络容量能显著提升两种方法的泛化能力，神经网络规模的影响远大于算法选择。

Conclusion: 在大模型时代，TD方法的归纳偏置可能不再必要，经验拼接可以通过模型规模而非专门算法实现。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) promises to solve long-horizon tasks even when
training data contains only short fragments of the behaviors. This experience
stitching capability is often viewed as the purview of temporal difference (TD)
methods. However, outside of small tabular settings, trajectories never
intersect, calling into question this conventional wisdom. Moreover, the common
belief is that Monte Carlo (MC) methods should not be able to recombine
experience, yet it remains unclear whether function approximation could result
in a form of implicit stitching. The goal of this paper is to empirically study
whether the conventional wisdom about stitching actually holds in settings
where function approximation is used. We empirically demonstrate that Monte
Carlo (MC) methods can also achieve experience stitching. While TD methods do
achieve slightly stronger capabilities than MC methods (in line with
conventional wisdom), that gap is significantly smaller than the gap between
small and large neural networks (even on quite simple tasks). We find that
increasing critic capacity effectively reduces the generalization gap for both
the MC and TD methods. These results suggest that the traditional TD inductive
bias for stitching may be less necessary in the era of large models for RL and,
in some cases, may offer diminishing returns. Additionally, our results suggest
that stitching, a form of generalization unique to the RL setting, might be
achieved not through specialized algorithms (temporal difference learning) but
rather through the same recipe that has provided generalization in other
machine learning settings (via scale). Project website:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了因果可解释性的概念，分析了两类常见模型（黑盒和基于概念的预测器）在因果可解释性方面的局限性，并开发了一个框架来构建具有因果可解释性的模型，揭示了因果可解释性与预测准确性之间的权衡关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解深度学习模型的预测在关键应用中仍然是一个核心挑战，需要让模型能够回答反事实问题——超越观测数据的假设性"如果...会怎样"场景，以提供对模型推理的洞察。

Method: 引入因果可解释性的概念，分析黑盒和基于概念的预测器的局限性，开发构建因果可解释模型的框架，推导出确定模型架构是否支持特定反事实查询的完整图准则，识别出在保持最大预测表达能力的同时实现可解释性的特征集。

Result: 理论分析表明黑盒和基于概念的预测器通常不具有因果可解释性，提出的框架能够构建因果可解释的模型，实验证实了理论发现。

Conclusion: 存在因果可解释性与预测准确性之间的基本权衡关系，通过识别适当的特征集可以在保持模型表达能力的同时实现因果可解释性。

Abstract: Understanding the predictions made by deep learning models remains a central
challenge, especially in high-stakes applications. A promising approach is to
equip models with the ability to answer counterfactual questions --
hypothetical ``what if?'' scenarios that go beyond the observed data and
provide insight into a model reasoning. In this work, we introduce the notion
of causal interpretability, which formalizes when counterfactual queries can be
evaluated from a specific class of models and observational data. We analyze
two common model classes -- blackbox and concept-based predictors -- and show
that neither is causally interpretable in general. To address this gap, we
develop a framework for building models that are causally interpretable by
design. Specifically, we derive a complete graphical criterion that determines
whether a given model architecture supports a given counterfactual query. This
leads to a fundamental tradeoff between causal interpretability and predictive
accuracy, which we characterize by identifying the unique maximal set of
features that yields an interpretable model with maximal predictive
expressiveness. Experiments corroborate the theoretical findings.

*T. Tony Cai,Xiang Li,Qi Long,Weijie J. Su,Garrett G. Wen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个统计框架来解决文本水印检测中因重复文本导致的伪随机性不完美问题，通过分层两层分区和最小单元概念，建立了严格的第一类错误控制，提高了检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本水印方法假设完美的伪随机性，但在实践中，生成文本中的重复会导致碰撞和结构化依赖，损害第一类错误控制并使标准分析无效。

Method: 引入统计框架，通过分层两层分区捕获结构依赖，核心是最小单元概念——跨单元独立但单元内允许依赖的最小群组。使用最小单元定义非渐近效率度量，将水印检测建模为极小极大假设检验问题。

Result: 应用于Gumbel-max和逆变换水印，框架产生闭式最优规则。解释了为什么丢弃重复统计量通常能提高性能，并表明除非退化，否则必须处理单元内依赖。理论和实验都证实了在严格第一类错误控制下检测能力的提升。

Conclusion: 这些结果为不完美伪随机性下的水印检测提供了首个原则性基础，为模型输出的可靠追踪提供了理论洞见和实践指导。

Abstract: Text watermarking plays a crucial role in ensuring the traceability and
accountability of large language model (LLM) outputs and mitigating misuse.
While promising, most existing methods assume perfect pseudorandomness. In
practice, repetition in generated text induces collisions that create
structured dependence, compromising Type I error control and invalidating
standard analyses.
  We introduce a statistical framework that captures this structure through a
hierarchical two-layer partition. At its core is the concept of minimal units
-- the smallest groups treatable as independent across units while permitting
dependence within. Using minimal units, we define a non-asymptotic efficiency
measure and cast watermark detection as a minimax hypothesis testing problem.
  Applied to Gumbel-max and inverse-transform watermarks, our framework
produces closed-form optimal rules. It explains why discarding repeated
statistics often improves performance and shows that within-unit dependence
must be addressed unless degenerate. Both theory and experiments confirm
improved detection power with rigorous Type I error control. These results
provide the first principled foundation for watermark detection under imperfect
pseudorandomness, offering both theoretical insight and practical guidance for
reliable tracing of model outputs.

Conclusion: DPE B填补了AlphaFold2衍生嵌入的空白，支持多种图神经网络方法进行PPI预测，可应用于系统生物学、药物靶点识别、通路分析和疾病机制研究。

Abstract: Computationally predicting protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is challenging
due to the lack of integrated, multimodal protein representations. DPEB is a
curated collection of 22,043 human proteins that integrates four embedding
types: structural (AlphaFold2), transformer-based sequence (BioEmbeddings),
contextual amino acid patterns (ESM-2: Evolutionary Scale Modeling), and
sequence-based n-gram statistics (ProtVec]). AlphaFold2 protein structures are
available through public databases (e.g., AlphaFold2 Protein Structure
Database), but the internal neural network embeddings are not. DPEB addresses
this gap by providing AlphaFold2-derived embeddings for computational modeling.
Our benchmark evaluations show GraphSAGE with BioEmbedding achieved the highest
PPI prediction performance (87.37% AUROC, 79.16% accuracy). The framework also

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Weighted Accuracy(WA)作为二元分类器的评估指标，该指标是准确率的加权版本，与最小化总分类成本(TCC)的目标一致，并提供了处理类别不平衡的成本敏感场景的框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分类器评估指标缺乏共识，且对数据集不平衡处理存在误解。实际优化目标是最大化投资回报或最小化总分类成本(TCC)。

Method: 定义Weighted Accuracy(WA)指标，建立与TCC最小化一致的概念框架，提出在缺乏完整成本信息时估计WA权重参数的方法。

Result: WA与TCC在示例依赖场景中具有强相关性，证明了其鲁棒性。该框架可应用于任何可表示为示例依赖量线性组合的指标。

Conclusion: WA提供了一个与TCC最小化目标一致的分类器评估框架，澄清了类别重平衡技术的适用场景，并能在不同数据集间进行比较。

Abstract: Selecting an appropriate evaluation metric for classifiers is crucial for
model comparison and parameter optimization, yet there is not consensus on a
universally accepted metric that serves as a definitive standard. Moreover,
there is often a misconception about the perceived need to mitigate imbalance
in datasets used to train classification models. Since the final goal in
classifier optimization is typically maximizing the return of investment or,
equivalently, minimizing the Total Classification Cost (TCC), we define
Weighted Accuracy (WA), an evaluation metric for binary classifiers with a
straightforward interpretation as a weighted version of the well-known accuracy
metric, coherent with the need of minimizing TCC. We clarify the conceptual
framework for handling class imbalance in cost-sensitive scenarios, providing
an alternative to rebalancing techniques. This framework can be applied to any
metric that, like WA, can be expressed as a linear combination of
example-dependent quantities and allows for comparing the results obtained in
different datasets and for addressing discrepancies between the development
dataset, used to train and validate the model, and the target dataset, where
the model will be deployed. It also specifies in which scenarios using
UCCs-unaware class rebalancing techniques or rebalancing metrics aligns with
TCC minimization and when it is instead counterproductive. Finally, we propose
a procedure to estimate the WA weight parameter in the absence of fully
specified UCCs and demonstrate the robustness of WA by analyzing its
correlation with TCC in example-dependent scenarios.

TL;DR: 开发了一种考虑制度信任的强化学习算法用于社区资源分配，发现在组织目标不确定时考虑信任能产生更成功的政策，但组织成功与社区福祉之间存在张力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RL算法假设公民会遵循政府制定的政策，但现实中缺乏制度信任时公民不会配合。需要开发考虑信任因素的算法来设计更有效的资源分配政策。

Method: 使用深度确定性策略梯度方法学习符合组织需求的资源分配策略，模拟资源分配过程并建模社区成员制度信任的变化，研究信任整合对结果的影响。

Result: 整合信任的RL算法能产生更成功的政策，特别是在组织目标不确定时；更保守的信任估计能提高公平性和平均社区信任，但会降低组织成功率；外部配额干预能在某些情况下改善公平性和信任。

Conclusion: 制度信任在算法设计和实施中至关重要，组织成功与社区福祉之间存在固有张力，需要在算法设计中平衡这两个目标。

Abstract: Many governmental bodies are adopting AI policies for decision-making. In
particular, Reinforcement Learning has been used to design policies that
citizens would be expected to follow if implemented. Much RL work assumes that
citizens follow these policies, and evaluate them with this in mind. However,
we know from prior work that without institutional trust, citizens will not
follow policies put in place by governments. In this work, we develop a
trust-aware RL algorithm for resource allocation in communities. We consider
the case of humanitarian engineering, where the organization is aiming to
distribute some technology or resource to community members. We use a Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient approach to learn a resource allocation that fits
the needs of the organization. Then, we simulate resource allocation according
to the learned policy, and model the changes in institutional trust of
community members. We investigate how this incorporation of institutional trust
affects outcomes, and ask how effectively an organization can learn policies if
trust values are private. We find that incorporating trust into RL algorithms
can lead to more successful policies, specifically when the organization's
goals are less certain. We find more conservative trust estimates lead to
increased fairness and average community trust, though organization success
suffers. Finally, we explore a strategy to prevent unfair outcomes to
communities. We implement a quota system by an external entity which decreases
the organization's utility when it does not serve enough community members. We
find this intervention can improve fairness and trust among communities in some
cases, while decreasing the success of the organization. This work underscores
the importance of institutional trust in algorithm design and implementation,
and identifies a tension between organization success and community well-being.

Motivation: 解决神经网络架构选择对可解释性、效率和泛化性的影响，以及高斯过程在大规模问题中计算成本高的问题。KKANs通过减少样条层并使用Chebyshev层和MLP来提高训练稳定性，但需要进一步改进以实现高效的不确定性量化。

Method: 开发K-DAREK算法，基于增强的KKAN架构，建立距离感知的鲁棒误差界限，反映测试点与最近训练点的接近程度。

Result: 在安全控制任务中，K-DAREK比Ensemble KANs快约4倍，计算效率高10倍，比GP扩展性高8.6倍（随数据量增加），比DAREK安全50%。

Conclusion: K-DAREK是一种高效、可解释且具有不确定性量化能力的函数逼近方法，特别适用于动态系统中的算子估计和系统建模，在安全关键应用中表现出色。

Abstract: Neural networks are parametric and powerful tools for function approximation,
and the choice of architecture heavily influences their interpretability,
efficiency, and generalization. In contrast, Gaussian processes (GPs) are
nonparametric probabilistic models that define distributions over functions
using a kernel to capture correlations among data points. However, these models
become computationally expensive for large-scale problems, as they require
inverting a large covariance matrix. Kolmogorov- Arnold networks (KANs),
semi-parametric neural architectures, have emerged as a prominent approach for
modeling complex functions with structured and efficient representations
through spline layers. Kurkova Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KKANs) extend this
idea by reducing the number of spline layers in KAN and replacing them with
Chebyshev layers and multi-layer perceptrons, thereby mapping inputs into
higher-dimensional spaces before applying spline-based transformations.
Compared to KANs, KKANs perform more stable convergence during training, making
them a strong architecture for estimating operators and system modeling in
dynamical systems. By enhancing the KKAN architecture, we develop a novel
learning algorithm, distance-aware error for Kurkova-Kolmogorov networks
(K-DAREK), for efficient and interpretable function approximation with
uncertainty quantification. Our approach establishes robust error bounds that
are distance-aware; this means they reflect the proximity of a test point to
its nearest training points. Through case studies on a safe control task, we
demonstrate that K-DAREK is about four times faster and ten times higher
computationally efficiency than Ensemble of KANs, 8.6 times more scalable than
GP by increasing the data size, and 50% safer than our previous work
distance-aware error for Kolmogorov networks (DAREK).

different schemes shape token representations across layers and provides a

Abstract: We study the problem of Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning (OSRL), where the
goal is to learn a reward-maximizing policy from fixed data under a cumulative
cost constraint. We propose a novel OSRL approach that frames the problem as a
minimax objective and solves it by combining offline RL with online
optimization algorithms. We prove the approximate optimality of this approach
when integrated with an approximate offline RL oracle and no-regret online
optimization. We also present a practical approximation that can be combined
with any offline RL algorithm, eliminating the need for offline policy
evaluation. Empirical results on the DSRL benchmark demonstrate that our method
reliably enforces safety constraints under stringent cost budgets, while
achieving high rewards. The code is available at

Abstract: Causal discovery from observational data is a fundamental task in artificial
intelligence, with far-reaching implications for decision-making, predictions,
and interventions. Despite significant advances, existing methods can be
broadly categorized as constraint-based or score-based approaches.
Constraint-based methods offer rigorous causal discovery but are often hindered
by small sample sizes, while score-based methods provide flexible optimization
but typically forgo explicit conditional independence testing. This work
explores a third avenue: developing differentiable $d$-separation scores,
obtained through a percolation theory using soft logic. This enables the
implementation of a new type of causal discovery method: gradient-based
optimization of conditional independence constraints. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate the robust performance of our approach in low-sample regimes,
surpassing traditional constraint-based and score-based baselines on a
real-world dataset. Code and data of the proposed method are publicly available
at https://github$.$com/PurdueMINDS/DAGPA.

Motivation: 单细胞技术生成的高维点云难以直接量化和比较个体间的生物学差异，非线性方法虽然预测准确但缺乏可解释性。

Method: 采用线性最优传输（LOT）框架，将不规则点云嵌入到固定维度的欧几里得空间，保持最优传输几何结构。

Conclusion: LOT作为统一框架，在预测性能、可解释性和生成建模之间架起桥梁，为理解高维生物系统中的免疫变异和治疗效果开辟新机会。

Abstract: Single-cell technologies generate high-dimensional point clouds of cells,
enabling detailed characterization of complex patient states and treatment
responses. Yet each patient is represented by an irregular point cloud rather
than a simple vector, making it difficult to directly quantify and compare
biological differences between individuals. Nonlinear methods such as kernels
and neural networks achieve predictive accuracy but act as black boxes,
offering little biological interpretability.
  To address these limitations, we adapt the Linear Optimal Transport (LOT)
framework to this setting, embedding irregular point clouds into a
fixed-dimensional Euclidean space while preserving distributional structure.
This embedding provides a principled linear representation that preserves
optimal transport geometry while enabling downstream analysis. It also forms a
registration between any two patients, enabling direct comparison of their
cellular distributions. Within this space, LOT enables: (i) \textbf{accurate
and interpretable classification} of COVID-19 patient states, where classifier
weights map back to specific markers and spatial regions driving predictions;
and (ii) \textbf{synthetic data generation} for patient-derived organoids,
exploiting the linearity of the LOT embedding. LOT barycenters yield averaged
cellular profiles representing combined conditions or samples, supporting drug
interaction testing.
  Together, these results establish LOT as a unified framework that bridges
predictive performance, interpretability, and generative modeling. By
transforming heterogeneous point clouds into structured embeddings directly
traceable to the original data, LOT opens new opportunities for understanding
immune variation and treatment effects in high-dimensional biological systems.

Abstract: The classic Mallows model is a foundational tool for modeling user
preferences. However, it has limitations in capturing real-world scenarios,
where users often focus only on a limited set of preferred items and are
indifferent to the rest. To address this, extensions such as the top-k Mallows
model have been proposed, aligning better with practical applications. In this
paper, we address several challenges related to the generalized top-k Mallows
model, with a focus on analyzing buyer choices. Our key contributions are: (1)
a novel sampling scheme tailored to generalized top-k Mallows models, (2) an
efficient algorithm for computing choice probabilities under this model, and
(3) an active learning algorithm for estimating the model parameters from
observed choice data. These contributions provide new tools for analysis and
prediction in critical decision-making scenarios. We present a rigorous
mathematical analysis for the performance of our algorithms. Furthermore,
through extensive experiments on synthetic data and real-world data, we
demonstrate the scalability and accuracy of our proposed methods, and we
compare the predictive power of Mallows model for top-k lists compared to the
simpler Multinomial Logit model.

statistical physics. This article considers the cases where the constrained
distribution is described by an unconstrained density, as well as additional
equality and/or inequality constraints, which often make the constraint set
nonconvex. Existing methods for nonconvex constraint set $\Sigma \subset
\mathbb{R}^d$ defined by equality or inequality constraints commonly rely on
costly projection steps. Moreover, they cannot handle equality and inequality
constraints simultaneously as each method only specialized in one case. In
addition, rigorous and quantitative convergence guarantee is often lacking. In
this paper, we introduce Overdamped Langevin with LAnding (OLLA), a new
framework that can design overdamped Langevin dynamics accommodating both
equality and inequality constraints. The proposed dynamics also
deterministically corrects trajectories along the normal direction of the
constraint surface, thus obviating the need for explicit projections. We show
that, under suitable regularity conditions on the target density and $\Sigma$,
OLLA converges exponentially fast in $W_2$ distance to the constrained target
density $\rho_\Sigma(x) \propto \exp(-f(x))d\sigma_\Sigma$. Lastly, through
experiments, we demonstrate the efficiency of OLLA compared to projection-based
constrained Langevin algorithms and their slack variable variants, highlighting
its favorable computational cost and reasonable empirical mixing.

Abstract: Power flow (PF) calculations are the backbone of real-time grid operations,
across workflows such as contingency analysis (where repeated PF evaluations
assess grid security under outages) and topology optimization (which involves
PF-based searches over combinatorially large action spaces). Running these
calculations at operational timescales or across large evaluation spaces
remains a major computational bottleneck. Additionally, growing uncertainty in
power system operations from the integration of renewables and climate-induced
extreme weather also calls for tools that can accurately and efficiently
simulate a wide range of scenarios and operating conditions. Machine learning
methods offer a potential speedup over traditional solvers, but their
performance has not been systematically assessed on benchmarks that capture
real-world variability. This paper introduces PF$\Delta$, a benchmark dataset
for power flow that captures diverse variations in load, generation, and
topology. PF$\Delta$ contains 859,800 solved power flow instances spanning six
different bus system sizes, capturing three types of contingency scenarios (N ,
N -1, and N -2), and including close-to-infeasible cases near steady-state
voltage stability limits. We evaluate traditional solvers and GNN-based
methods, highlighting key areas where existing approaches struggle, and
identifying open problems for future research. Our dataset is available at

Abstract: With the rise of online and virtual learning, monitoring and enhancing
student engagement have become an important aspect of effective education.
Traditional methods of assessing a student's involvement might not be
applicable directly to virtual environments. In this study, we focused on this
problem and addressed the need to develop an automated system to detect student
engagement levels during online learning. We proposed a novel training method
which can discourage a model from leveraging sensitive features like gender for
its predictions. The proposed method offers benefits not only in the
enforcement of ethical standards, but also to enhance interpretability of the
model predictions. We applied an attribute-orthogonal regularization technique
to a split-model classifier, which uses multiple transfer learning strategies
to achieve effective results in reducing disparity in the distribution of
prediction for sensitivity groups from a Pearson correlation coefficient of
0.897 for the unmitigated model, to 0.999 for the mitigated model. The source

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are known to operate with high accuracy on
learning from graph-structured data, but they suffer from high computational
and resource costs. Neural network compression methods are used to reduce the
model size while maintaining reasonable accuracy. Two of the common neural
network compression techniques include pruning and quantization. In this
research, we empirically examine the effects of three pruning methods and three
quantization methods on different GNN models, including graph classification
tasks, node classification tasks, and link prediction. We conducted all
experiments on three graph datasets, including Cora, Proteins, and BBBP. Our
findings demonstrate that unstructured fine-grained and global pruning can
significantly reduce the model's size(50\%) while maintaining or even improving
precision after fine-tuning the pruned model. The evaluation of different
quantization methods on GNN shows diverse impacts on accuracy, inference time,
and model size across different datasets.

<details>

Motivation: 现有函数回归方法（如函数线性模型和神经算子）要么无法捕捉复杂非线性关系，要么在噪声、稀疏和不规则采样数据下缺乏可靠的不确定性量化。

Method: 设计基于GP的线性和非线性变换序列，利用核积分变换、GP插值和从GP采样的非线性激活函数。使用诱导点和白化变换开发变分学习算法进行可扩展概率推断。

Result: 在真实世界和PDE基准数据集上的实验结果表明，DGPFM在预测性能和不确定性校准方面具有优势。

Conclusion: DGPFM通过深度高斯过程框架有效解决了函数空间映射中的非线性建模和不确定性量化问题，在复杂函数回归任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Learning mappings between functional spaces, also known as
function-on-function regression, plays a crucial role in functional data
analysis and has broad applications, e.g. spatiotemporal forecasting, curve
prediction, and climate modeling. Existing approaches, such as functional
linear models and neural operators, either fall short of capturing complex
nonlinearities or lack reliable uncertainty quantification under noisy, sparse,
and irregularly sampled data. To address these issues, we propose Deep Gaussian
Processes for Functional Maps (DGPFM). Our method designs a sequence of
GP-based linear and nonlinear transformations, leveraging integral transforms
of kernels, GP interpolation, and nonlinear activations sampled from GPs. A key
insight simplifies implementation: under fixed locations, discrete
approximations of kernel integral transforms collapse into direct functional
integral transforms, enabling flexible incorporation of various integral
transform designs. To achieve scalable probabilistic inference, we use inducing
points and whitening transformations to develop a variational learning
algorithm. Empirical results on real-world and PDE benchmark datasets
demonstrate that the advantage of DGPFM in both predictive performance and
uncertainty calibration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RMAB假设二元动作和单一全局预算，而现实场景如医疗保健涉及多种干预措施和异构成本约束，需要更通用的框架。

Method: 使用神经网络学习臂-动作对的索引，通过熵正则化最优传输问题构建可微背包层，统一索引预测和约束优化，基于线性规划松弛的理论上界进行梯度训练。

Result: NIP在严格执行异构预算约束下，达到接近最优性能（与oracle策略相差5%以内），可扩展到数百个臂。

Conclusion: 为复杂资源受限环境中的索引策略学习建立了通用、理论基础扎实且可扩展的框架。

Abstract: Restless multi-armed bandits (RMABs) provide a scalable framework for
sequential decision-making under uncertainty, but classical formulations assume
binary actions and a single global budget. Real-world settings, such as
healthcare, often involve multiple interventions with heterogeneous costs and
constraints, where such assumptions break down. We introduce a Neural Index
Policy (NIP) for multi-action RMABs with heterogeneous budget constraints. Our
approach learns to assign budget-aware indices to arm--action pairs using a
neural network, and converts them into feasible allocations via a
differentiable knapsack layer formulated as an entropy-regularized optimal
transport (OT) problem. The resulting model unifies index prediction and
constrained optimization in a single end-to-end differentiable framework,
enabling gradient-based training directly on decision quality. The network is
optimized to align its induced occupancy measure with the theoretical upper
bound from a linear programming relaxation, bridging asymptotic RMAB theory
with practical learning. Empirically, NIP achieves near-optimal performance
within 5% of the oracle occupancy-measure policy while strictly enforcing
heterogeneous budgets and scaling to hundreds of arms. This work establishes a
general, theoretically grounded, and scalable framework for learning
index-based policies in complex resource-constrained environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成建模在表示学习方面很强大，但在医学成像等挑战性领域直接应用有限：单纯的生成缺乏任务对齐，无法为临床使用提供坚实基础。

Method: 构建为可逆和可微分双射的层次结构，其中雅可比行列式在子变换间分解。通过条件化类别标签，支持可控样本合成和原则性类别概率估计。

Result: 在多个数据集上评估显示，MAGIC-Flow创建了真实多样的样本并改进了分类性能，解决了扫描仪噪声下的生成和分类，以及模态特定合成和识别。

Conclusion: MAGIC-Flow是数据有限领域中生成和分类的有效策略，对隐私保护增强、鲁棒泛化和可信赖医学AI具有直接益处。

Abstract: Generative modeling has emerged as a powerful paradigm for representation
learning, but its direct applicability to challenging fields like medical
imaging remains limited: mere generation, without task alignment, fails to
provide a robust foundation for clinical use. We propose MAGIC-Flow, a
conditional multiscale normalizing flow architecture that performs generation
and classification within a single modular framework. The model is built as a
hierarchy of invertible and differentiable bijections, where the Jacobian
determinant factorizes across sub-transformations. We show how this ensures
exact likelihood computation and stable optimization, while invertibility
enables explicit visualization of sample likelihoods, providing an
interpretable lens into the model's reasoning. By conditioning on class labels,
MAGIC-Flow supports controllable sample synthesis and principled
class-probability estimation, effectively aiding both generative and
discriminative objectives. We evaluate MAGIC-Flow against top baselines using
metrics for similarity, fidelity, and diversity. Across multiple datasets, it
addresses generation and classification under scanner noise, and
modality-specific synthesis and identification. Results show MAGIC-Flow creates
realistic, diverse samples and improves classification. MAGIC-Flow is an
effective strategy for generation and classification in data-limited domains,
with direct benefits for privacy-preserving augmentation, robust
generalization, and trustworthy medical AI.

Method: 建立可验证管道（构建验证+依赖固定），开发简化管道进行大规模RL，使用Qwen3-32B进行SFT和RL训练。

Result: SFT模型性能与GPT-4.1相当但模型小56倍，RL带来7-20%绝对提升，但模型无法跨环境泛化。

Conclusion: 训练-测试环境匹配对于构建可靠的现实世界代码修复代理至关重要，模型泛化能力有限。

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of training reliable code-fixing agents in real
repositories, where complex builds and shifting dependencies make evaluation
unstable. We developed a verifiable pipeline with success defined as post-fix
build validation and improved reproducibility across ~1K real issues by pinning
dependencies and disabling automatic upgrades. Building on this, we introduced
a scalable simplified pipeline for large-scale reinforcement learning (RL).
Using this setup, we supervised fine-tuned Qwen3-32B in the full pipeline and
applied RL on top of the SFT model in the simplified environment. The SFT model
distilled from GPT-4.1 trajectories performs on par while being 56x smaller,
and RL added 7-20% absolute gains under matched train-test conditions.
"Thinking mode" was on par or worse in our experiments. Both SFT and RL models
failed to generalize across environments, highlighting the importance of
matching train-test environments for building reliable real-world code-fixing
agents.

Result: 在13天预报期误差降低超过5%，在1%和99%分位数极端条件下误差降低5-8%，提升了罕见事件的可靠性预测。利用预训练权重可在单个epoch内收敛，大幅降低训练成本和碳足迹。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了多尺度天气预报中的物理约束整合问题，在提升预测精度的同时显著降低了计算成本，对机器学习可持续发展和研究可及性具有重要意义。

Abstract: Climate events arise from intricate, multivariate dynamics governed by
global-scale drivers, profoundly impacting food, energy, and infrastructure.
Yet, accurate weather prediction remains elusive due to physical processes
unfolding across diverse spatio-temporal scales, which fixed-resolution methods
cannot capture. Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) offer a multiscale
representation, but nonlinear downward mappings often erase global trends,
weakening the integration of physics into forecasts. We introduce HiFlowCast
and its ensemble variant HiAntFlow, HGNNs that embed physics within a
multiscale prediction framework. Two innovations underpin their design: a
Latent-Memory-Retention mechanism that preserves global trends during downward
traversal, and a Latent-to-Physics branch that integrates PDE solution fields
across diverse scales. Our Flow models cut errors by over 5% at 13-day lead
times and by 5-8% under 1st and 99th quantile extremes, improving reliability
for rare events. Leveraging pretrained model weights, they converge within a
single epoch, reducing training cost and their carbon footprint. Such
efficiency is vital as the growing scale of machine learning challenges
sustainability and limits research accessibility. Code and model weights are in

Conclusion: 显式建模器官交互的时空依赖关系能实现更准确、可泛化的药物浓度预测，动态GNN为传统PBPK提供了可扩展的无方程替代方案。

Abstract: Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling plays a critical role
in drug development by predicting drug concentration dynamics across organs.
Traditional approaches rely on ordinary differential equations with strong
simplifying assumptions, which limit their adaptability to nonlinear
physiological interactions. In this study, we explore data-driven alternatives
for PBPK prediction using deep learning. Two baseline architectures - a
multilayer perceptron (MLP) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network - are
implemented to capture molecular and temporal dependencies, respectively. To
incorporate inter-organ interactions, we propose a Dynamic Graph Neural Network
(Dynamic GNN) that models physiological connections as recurrent
message-passing processes between organs. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed Dynamic GNN achieves the highest predictive performance among all
models, with an R^2 of 0.9342, an RMSE of 0.0159, and an MAE of 0.0116. In
comparison, the MLP baseline obtains an R^2 of 0.8705 and the LSTM achieves
0.8059. These results highlight that explicitly modeling the spatial and
temporal dependencies of organ interactions enables more accurate and
generalizable drug concentration prediction. The Dynamic GNN provides a
scalable, equation-free alternative to traditional PBPK formulations and
demonstrates strong potential for data-driven pharmacokinetic modeling in
preclinical and clinical research.

Conclusion: AniDS框架通过各向异性噪声建模显著提升了3D分子去噪性能，更好地反映了分子系统的方向性和结构变异性。

Abstract: Coordinate denoising has emerged as a promising method for 3D molecular
pretraining due to its theoretical connection to learning molecular force
field. However, existing denoising methods rely on oversimplied molecular
dynamics that assume atomic motions to be isotropic and homoscedastic. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel denoising framework AniDS:
Anisotropic Variational Autoencoder for 3D Molecular Denoising. AniDS
introduces a structure-aware anisotropic noise generator that can produce
atom-specific, full covariance matrices for Gaussian noise distributions to
better reflect directional and structural variability in molecular systems.
These covariances are derived from pairwise atomic interactions as anisotropic
corrections to an isotropic base. Our design ensures that the resulting
covariance matrices are symmetric, positive semi-definite, and
SO(3)-equivariant, while providing greater capacity to model complex molecular
dynamics. Extensive experiments show that AniDS outperforms prior isotropic and
homoscedastic denoising models and other leading methods on the MD17 and OC22
benchmarks, achieving average relative improvements of 8.9% and 6.2% in force
prediction accuracy. Our case study on a crystal and molecule structure shows
that AniDS adaptively suppresses noise along the bonding direction, consistent
with physicochemical principles. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 提出的隐式梯度手术方法能够高效实现效用保持的机器遗忘，在遗忘效果和模型性能之间取得更好的平衡。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to efficiently remove sensitive or harmful
memory from a pre-trained model. The key challenge is to balance the potential
tradeoff between unlearning efficacy and utility preservation, which involves
forgetting undesirable information as defined while maintaining the model's
original performance. One potential way to tackle this problem is to use
multi-objective optimization to jointly optimize both the unlearning and
utility preservation objectives. However, existing multi-objective methods only
guarantee finding a Pareto-optimal solution without fine-grained control, which
causes under-optimization of the unlearning objective. To this end, we first
model MU as a constrained optimization problem, that is, optimizing the
unlearning objective under the constraint of a bounded increase for utility
loss. We then show that solving this optimization problem is equivalent to
unilateral gradient surgery on the unlearning objective. To resolve the
additional computational cost brought by gradient surgery, we propose an
implicit gradient surgery method, which approximates the solution to the
aforementioned constrained optimization problem via only one backpropagation,
thereby achieving efficient utility-preserving MU. Theoretically, we provide a
tight convergence analysis of the algorithm. Empirically, our extensive
experiments show that the proposed algorithm achieves better tradeoff results
than existing baselines. Codes are available at

Result: 发现NCO模型编码了构建解决方案所需的低级信息，同时捕获了促进更好决策的高级知识。CS-Probing揭示了主流NCO模型对其学习表示施加了不同的归纳偏置，发现了与模型泛化相关的直接证据，并识别了与特定知识相关的关键嵌入维度。

Conclusion: 这项工作首次系统性地尝试解释黑盒NCO模型，展示了探测作为分析其内部机制的有前景工具，为NCO社区揭示了重要见解，并且通过少量代码修改就能改进分析模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) has achieved remarkable performance,
yet its learned model representations and decision rationale remain a black
box. This impedes both academic research and practical deployment, since
researchers and stakeholders require deeper insights into NCO models. In this
paper, we take the first critical step towards interpreting NCO models by
investigating their representations through various probing tasks. Moreover, we
introduce a novel probing tool named Coefficient Significance Probing
(CS-Probing) to enable deeper analysis of NCO representations by examining the
coefficients and statistical significance during probing. Extensive experiments
and analysis reveal that NCO models encode low-level information essential for
solution construction, while capturing high-level knowledge to facilitate
better decisions. Using CS-Probing, we find that prevalent NCO models impose
varying inductive biases on their learned representations, uncover direct
evidence related to model generalization, and identify key embedding dimensions
associated with specific knowledge. These insights can be potentially
translated into practice, for example, with minor code modifications, we
improve the generalization of the analyzed model. Our work represents a first
systematic attempt to interpret black-box NCO models, showcasing probing as a
promising tool for analyzing their internal mechanisms and revealing insights
for the NCO community. The source code is publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Shapley值计算需要枚举所有特征联盟，复杂度为O(2^n)，在大规模特征场景下计算成本过高

Method: 将预测器的局部行为表示为因子化多线性映射，构建张量网络替代模型，通过少量针对性评估提取k阶Shapley交互

Result: 在UCI数据集上，方法在保持精度的同时将评估次数减少数个数量级，比KernelSHAP-IQ快25-1000倍

Conclusion: TN-SHAP提供了一种高效计算Shapley交互的方法，在保证理论近似误差的同时显著降低计算成本

Abstract: We show how to replace the O(2^n) coalition enumeration over n features
behind Shapley values and Shapley-style interaction indices with a
few-evaluation scheme on a tensor-network (TN) surrogate: TN-SHAP. The key idea
is to represent a predictor's local behavior as a factorized multilinear map,
so that coalitional quantities become linear probes of a coefficient tensor.
TN-SHAP replaces exhaustive coalition sweeps with just a small number of
targeted evaluations to extract order-k Shapley interactions. In particular,
both order-1 (single-feature) and order-2 (pairwise) computations have cost
O(n*poly(chi) + n^2), where chi is the TN's maximal cut rank. We provide
theoretical guarantees on the approximation error and tractability of TN-SHAP.
On UCI datasets, our method matches enumeration on the fitted surrogate while
reducing evaluation by orders of magnitude and achieves 25-1000x wall-clock
speedups over KernelSHAP-IQ at comparable accuracy, while amortizing training

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有终身知识编辑方法在编辑过程中会累积错误，导致编辑准确性和泛化能力逐渐下降，需要解决这一问题。

Method: 结合神经元功能归因识别知识通用神经元和知识特定神经元，引入熵引导的动态稀疏掩码定位目标知识相关神经元，实现精确的神经元级知识编辑。

Result: 经过数千次连续编辑的实验表明，NMKE在维持高编辑成功率和保护模型通用能力方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: NMKE框架通过细粒度的神经元级编辑策略，有效解决了终身知识编辑中的错误累积问题，实现了更稳定和精确的知识更新。

Abstract: Lifelong knowledge editing enables continuous, precise updates to outdated
knowledge in large language models (LLMs) without computationally expensive
full retraining. However, existing methods often accumulate errors throughout
the editing process, causing a gradual decline in both editing accuracy and
generalization. To tackle this problem, we propose Neuron-Specific Masked
Knowledge Editing (NMKE), a novel fine-grained editing framework that combines
neuron-level attribution with dynamic sparse masking. Leveraging neuron
functional attribution, we identify two key types of knowledge neurons, with
knowledge-general neurons activating consistently across prompts and
knowledge-specific neurons activating to specific prompts. NMKE further
introduces an entropy-guided dynamic sparse mask, locating relevant neurons to
the target knowledge. This strategy enables precise neuron-level knowledge
editing with fewer parameter modifications. Experimental results from thousands
of sequential edits demonstrate that NMKE outperforms existing methods in
maintaining high editing success rates and preserving model general
capabilities in lifelong editing.

*Mohammadsajad Alipour,Mohammad Mohammadi Amiri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为"独裁者客户端"的新型恶意参与者类别，能够完全消除其他客户端对服务器模型的贡献，同时保留自己的贡献。分析了多种复杂场景下多个独裁者客户端的影响，并通过理论分析和实验验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习的去中心化特性引入了安全漏洞，恶意客户端可能破坏或操纵训练过程。需要研究一种能够完全控制模型训练结果的新型攻击方式。

Method: 提出了具体的攻击策略，使独裁者客户端能够消除其他客户端的贡献。系统分析了这些攻击对学习过程的影响，并探讨了多个独裁者客户端在不同场景下的行为。

Result: 理论分析和实验评估表明，独裁者客户端能够成功消除其他客户端的贡献，在计算机视觉和自然语言处理基准测试中验证了攻击的有效性。

Conclusion: 独裁者客户端构成了联邦学习中的严重安全威胁，需要开发相应的防御机制来应对这种新型攻击。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for decentralized
model training, enabling multiple clients to collaboratively learn a shared
model without exchanging their local data. However, the decentralized nature of
FL also introduces vulnerabilities, as malicious clients can compromise or
manipulate the training process. In this work, we introduce dictator clients, a
novel, well-defined, and analytically tractable class of malicious participants
capable of entirely erasing the contributions of all other clients from the
server model, while preserving their own. We propose concrete attack strategies
that empower such clients and systematically analyze their effects on the
learning process. Furthermore, we explore complex scenarios involving multiple
dictator clients, including cases where they collaborate, act independently, or
form an alliance in order to ultimately betray one another. For each of these
settings, we provide a theoretical analysis of their impact on the global
model's convergence. Our theoretical algorithms and findings about the complex
scenarios including multiple dictator clients are further supported by
empirical evaluations on both computer vision and natural language processing
benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于非平稳连续平均场博弈的深度强化学习算法，结合虚构博弈、条件归一化流和深度强化学习，解决了现有方法在可扩展性和密度近似方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有平均场博弈的强化学习方法通常局限于有限空间或平稳模型，限制了其在现实世界问题中的应用，需要开发能够处理非平稳连续空间的方法。

Method: 基于虚构博弈框架，使用深度强化学习计算最优响应，监督学习表示平均策略，并采用条件归一化流学习时间相关的群体分布表示。

Result: 在三个复杂度递增的示例上验证了方法的有效性，展示了在可扩展性和密度近似方面的显著改进。

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了将深度强化学习技术应用于复杂平均场博弈问题的重要进展，使该领域更接近现实世界的多智能体系统。

Abstract: Mean field games (MFGs) have emerged as a powerful framework for modeling
interactions in large-scale multi-agent systems. Despite recent advancements in
reinforcement learning (RL) for MFGs, existing methods are typically limited to
finite spaces or stationary models, hindering their applicability to real-world
problems. This paper introduces a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
algorithm specifically designed for non-stationary continuous MFGs. The
proposed approach builds upon a Fictitious Play (FP) methodology, leveraging
DRL for best-response computation and supervised learning for average policy
representation. Furthermore, it learns a representation of the time-dependent
population distribution using a Conditional Normalizing Flow. To validate the
effectiveness of our method, we evaluate it on three different examples of
increasing complexity. By addressing critical limitations in scalability and
density approximation, this work represents a significant advancement in
applying DRL techniques to complex MFG problems, bringing the field closer to
real-world multi-agent systems.

*Nadav Dym,Matthias Wellershoff,Efstratios Tsoukanis,Daniel Levy,Radu Balan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了基于排序的嵌入方法β_A，改进了嵌入维度的上下界估计，并分析了该嵌入的双Lipschitz失真性质。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在图像深度学习中，输出需要对图像节点的排列保持不变性。之前的研究表明对于足够大的D和适当的A，映射β_A是单射且满足双Lipschitz条件，但存在两个关键问题：最优嵌入维度D未知，以及双Lipschitz常数的估计未知。

Method: 研究排序嵌入β_A: ℝ^(n×d) → ℝ^(n×D)，其中X ↦ ↓(XA)，↓表示矩阵的列排序。通过构造特定矩阵A来分析嵌入性质，并提供嵌入维度的上下界估计。

Result: 改进了嵌入维度D的上界，提供了最小单射维度的下界。构造了使得β_A的双Lipschitz失真与n成二次关系且与d无关的矩阵A，并证明失真至少为Ω(√n)。还对通过线性投影减少输出维度的β_A变体提供了类似结果。

Conclusion: 该研究在排序嵌入的单射性和双Lipschitz性质方面取得了实质性进展，为图像深度学习中的不变性表示提供了理论保证和实用指导。

Abstract: We study the sorting-based embedding $\beta_{\mathbf A} : \mathbb R^{n \times
d} \to \mathbb R^{n \times D}$, $\mathbf X \mapsto {\downarrow}(\mathbf X
\mathbf A)$, where $\downarrow$ denotes column wise sorting of matrices. Such
embeddings arise in graph deep learning where outputs should be invariant to
permutations of graph nodes. Previous work showed that for large enough $D$ and
appropriate $\mathbf A$, the mapping $\beta_{\mathbf A}$ is injective, and
moreover satisfies a bi-Lipschitz condition. However, two gaps remain: firstly,
the optimal size $D$ required for injectivity is not yet known, and secondly,
no estimates of the bi-Lipschitz constants of the mapping are known.
  In this paper, we make substantial progress in addressing both of these gaps.
Regarding the first gap, we improve upon the best known upper bounds for the
embedding dimension $D$ necessary for injectivity, and also provide a lower
bound on the minimal injectivity dimension. Regarding the second gap, we
construct matrices $\mathbf A$, so that the bi-Lipschitz distortion of
$\beta_{\mathbf A} $ depends quadratically on $n$, and is completely
independent of $d$. We also show that the distortion of $\beta_{\mathbf A}$ is
necessarily at least in $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$. Finally, we provide similar results
for variants of $\beta_{\mathbf A}$ obtained by applying linear projections to
reduce the output dimension of $\beta_{\mathbf A}$.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个任务特定的多数据集联合预训练框架，用于跨数据集情绪识别，通过跨数据集协方差对齐损失和混合编码器解决数据分布差异和EEG复杂动态建模问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有任务通用预训练EEG模型在处理复杂任务（如情绪识别）时存在困难，因为任务特定特征与广泛预训练方法不匹配。需要解决跨数据集分布偏移、情绪类别定义不一致和受试者间变异性大的问题。

Method: 引入跨数据集协方差对齐损失来对齐数据集间的二阶统计特性；提出混合编码器，结合类Mamba线性注意力通道编码器和时空动态模型来捕捉EEG的长期依赖和复杂动态。

Result: 在少样本情绪识别中平均AUROC比最先进的大规模EEG模型提高4.57%，在零样本泛化到新数据集时准确率提高11.92%。多数据集联合预训练相比单数据集训练获得8.55%的性能提升。

Conclusion: 为任务特定预训练提供了一个可扩展框架，并展示了其在可泛化情感计算中的优势。

Abstract: Task-specific pre-training is essential when task representations diverge
from generic pre-training features. Existing task-general pre-training EEG
models struggle with complex tasks like emotion recognition due to mismatches
between task-specific features and broad pre-training approaches. This work
aims to develop a task-specific multi-dataset joint pre-training framework for
cross-dataset emotion recognition, tackling problems of large inter-dataset
distribution shifts, inconsistent emotion category definitions, and substantial
inter-subject variability. We introduce a cross-dataset covariance alignment
loss to align second-order statistical properties across datasets, enabling
robust generalization without the need for extensive labels or per-subject
calibration. To capture the long-term dependency and complex dynamics of EEG,
we propose a hybrid encoder combining a Mamba-like linear attention channel
encoder and a spatiotemporal dynamics model. Our method outperforms
state-of-the-art large-scale EEG models by an average of 4.57% in AUROC for
few-shot emotion recognition and 11.92% in accuracy for zero-shot
generalization to a new dataset. Performance scales with the increase of
datasets used in pre-training. Multi-dataset joint pre-training achieves a
performance gain of 8.55% over single-dataset training. This work provides a
scalable framework for task-specific pre-training and highlights its benefit in
generalizable affective computing. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于掩码语言模型的误差有界预测编码（EPC）方法，用于有损文本压缩，通过存储最小化的基于排名的修正来实现连续的率失真控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在有损压缩领域的应用，在重建保真度和压缩比之间进行权衡，利用LLM作为强大的概率模型来改进文本压缩效率。

Method: 使用掩码语言模型作为解压缩器，允许模型预测被掩码的内容，仅当模型预测错误时存储基于排名的最小修正，从而创建提供连续率失真控制的残差通道。

Result: EPC在率失真分析中始终优于预测掩码基线方法，以显著更低的比特率提供更优的保真度，通过更有效地利用模型内在知识实现高效压缩。

Conclusion: 误差有界预测编码（EPC）是一种有效的有损文本压缩方法，能够充分利用语言模型的预测能力，在压缩比和重建质量之间实现更好的平衡。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve near-optimal lossless compression by
acting as powerful probability models. We investigate their use in the lossy
domain, where reconstruction fidelity is traded for higher compression ratios.
This paper introduces Error-Bounded Predictive Coding (EPC), a lossy text codec
that leverages a Masked Language Model (MLM) as a decompressor. Instead of
storing a subset of original tokens, EPC allows the model to predict masked
content and stores minimal, rank-based corrections only when the model's top
prediction is incorrect. This creates a residual channel that offers continuous
rate-distortion control. We compare EPC to a simpler Predictive Masking (PM)
baseline and a transform-based Vector Quantisation with a Residual Patch
(VQ+RE) approach. Through an evaluation that includes precise bit accounting
and rate-distortion analysis, we demonstrate that EPC consistently dominates
PM, offering superior fidelity at a significantly lower bit rate by more
efficiently utilising the model's intrinsic knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预训练模型在泛化行为上存在差异，不同模型掌握着其他模型无法获得的数据特定洞察，可以利用这种多样性来改进模型性能

Method: 引入数据划分策略，让预训练模型自主选择学生或教师角色进行双向知识迁移，支持同架构和跨架构的知识传递

Result: 在图像分类中ViT-B性能提升约1.4%；语义分割中所有评估指标均有提升；视频显著性预测达到新SOTA；多模型知识迁移使所有参与者性能显著提升

Conclusion: 利用预训练模型库作为辅助知识源是有效的模型改进方法，通过自主角色分配和知识迁移能够显著提升各种任务的性能

Abstract: Pretrained models are ubiquitous in the current deep learning landscape,
offering strong results on a broad range of tasks. Recent works have shown that
models differing in various design choices exhibit categorically diverse
generalization behavior, resulting in one model grasping distinct data-specific
insights unavailable to the other. In this paper, we propose to leverage large
publicly available model repositories as an auxiliary source of model
improvements. We introduce a data partitioning strategy where pretrained models
autonomously adopt either the role of a student, seeking knowledge, or that of
a teacher, imparting knowledge. Experiments across various tasks demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposed approach. In image classification, we
improved the performance of ViT-B by approximately 1.4% through bidirectional
knowledge transfer with ViT-T. For semantic segmentation, our method boosted
all evaluation metrics by enabling knowledge transfer both within and across
backbone architectures. In video saliency prediction, our approach achieved a
new state-of-the-art. We further extend our approach to knowledge transfer
between multiple models, leading to considerable performance improvements for
all model participants.

Motivation: 公平机器学习方法通常产生多个平衡预测公平性和性能的模型，这种多样性给利益相关者选择符合其需求和价值观的模型带来了挑战。

Method: 利用弱监督度量学习学习反映公平性和性能结果相似性的Mahalanobis距离，然后应用k-means聚类基于特征重要性表示对模型进行分组。

Result: 该框架能够有效结构化模型特征重要性空间，帮助用户探索具有相似预测行为和公平性特征的模型集群。

Conclusion: 该交互式框架通过帮助用户理解模型在公平性-性能平衡和驱动预测的特征方面的差异，促进了明智的决策制定。

Abstract: In the context of algorithmic decision-making, fair machine learning methods
often yield multiple models that balance predictive fairness and performance in
varying degrees. This diversity introduces a challenge for stakeholders who
must select a model that aligns with their specific requirements and values. To
address this, we propose an interactive framework that assists in navigating
and interpreting the trade-offs across a portfolio of models. Our approach
leverages weakly supervised metric learning to learn a Mahalanobis distance
that reflects similarity in fairness and performance outcomes, effectively
structuring the feature importance space of the models according to
stakeholder-relevant criteria. We then apply clustering technique (k-means) to
group models based on their transformed representations of feature importances,
allowing users to explore clusters of models with similar predictive behaviors
and fairness characteristics. This facilitates informed decision-making by
helping users understand how models differ not only in their
fairness-performance balance but also in the features that drive their
predictions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 层剪枝会严重损害大语言模型的测试时缩放能力，即使只剪枝1-2层也会导致长链推理性能崩溃，而标准微调方法无法恢复这种能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究层剪枝对长链推理能力的影响，特别是对测试时缩放这一关键推理机制的影响，因为现有方法主要关注通用知识任务而忽略了推理能力的脆弱性。

Method: 通过广泛的实验分析层剪枝对测试时缩放的影响，使用长推理基准测试评估性能变化，并进行深入机制分析。

Result: 剪枝即使1-2层也会严重损害测试时缩放能力，长推理基准性能急剧下降，而知识密集型和浅层推理任务性能保持稳定。标准监督微调无法恢复已受损的测试时缩放能力。

Conclusion: 层剪枝对推理密集型LLMs存在根本性风险，需要重新思考层剪枝策略并开发能够保持推理鲁棒性的方法。

Abstract: Layer pruning has emerged as a widely adopted technique for improving the
efficiency of large language models (LLMs). Although existing methods
demonstrate strong performance retention on general knowledge tasks, their
effect on long-chain reasoning, a more brittle yet crucial capability, remains
largely unexplored. In this work, we study the impact of layer pruning on
long-chain reasoning through the lens of test-time scaling, a key mechanism in
modern LLMs that enables strong reasoning capacity by allocating more
computation at inference time. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
pruning even one or two layers can severely impair test-time scaling, with
performance collapsing drastically on long reasoning benchmarks even when
performance on knowledge-intensive and shallow reasoning tasks remains stable.
Furthermore, we find that standard supervised fine-tuning remedies fail to
recover test-time scaling once it has deteriorated. Through in-depth analyses,
we identify the mechanisms underlying this fragility of test-time scaling and
highlight the fundamental risks of applying layer pruning to
reasoning-intensive LLMs. These findings call for a rethinking of layer pruning
strategies and provide insights for developing methods that preserve the
robustness of reasoning. We open-source the codebase in

TL;DR: LUNA是一个自监督的EEG基础模型，通过将多通道EEG压缩到固定大小的拓扑无关潜在空间，解决了电极布局异构性问题，在多个下游任务中表现出色，同时大幅降低了计算和内存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决EEG数据中电极布局异构性导致的模型泛化问题，传统方法难以处理不同公共数据集的自定义电极布局。

Method: 使用学习查询和交叉注意力将多通道EEG压缩到固定大小的拓扑无关潜在空间，下游transformer块仅在此潜在表示上使用补丁级时间自注意力操作，将计算与电极数量解耦。

Result: 在TUAR和TUSL基准测试中达到最先进水平（如TUAR上AUROC为0.921），同时将FLOPs减少300倍，GPU内存使用最多减少10倍。

Conclusion: LUNA能够有效协调不同的电极几何结构，在保持高性能的同时显著降低计算成本，这些优势在所有评估的电极配置中保持一致。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) offers a non-invasive lens into human brain
activity, but building large-scale models is hampered by topological
heterogeneity: each public EEG data defines its own electrode layout, limiting
generalization. We introduce LUNA (Latent Unified Network Architecture), a
self-supervised foundation model that reconciles disparate electrode geometries
while scaling linearly -- not quadratically -- with channel count. LUNA
compresses multi-channel EEG into a fixed-size, topology-agnostic latent space
via learned queries and cross-attention. Downstream transformer blocks then
operate exclusively on this latent representation using patch-wise temporal
self-attention, decoupling computation from electrode count. Pre-trained on
TUEG and Siena (over 21,000 hours of raw EEG across diverse montages) using a
masked-patch reconstruction objective, LUNA transfers effectively to four
downstream tasks: abnormality detection, artifact rejection, slowing
classification, and emotion recognition. It demonstrates highly competitive
performance across several benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results on
TUAR and TUSL, e.g., 0.921 AUROC on TUAR, while reducing FLOPs by 300x and
trimming GPU memory use by up to 10x. Critically, these gains are consistent
across all evaluated electrode configurations. Code is available at

<details>

Motivation: 机器学习在安全关键领域的部署受到限制，因为现有模型无法有效管理不确定性，在面对分布外数据、对抗性扰动或环境变化时会产生过度自信和不可靠的预测。

Method: 开发了随机集神经网络(RS-NN)，利用随机集理论预测类别集的置信函数，通过相关置信集的宽度捕捉认知不确定性程度。该方法还适用于大语言模型和自动驾驶赛车中的天气分类。

Result: 广泛实验验证，将认知意识整合到深度学习中不仅减轻了过度自信预测带来的风险，还为人工智能的范式转变奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 真正的智能涉及识别和管理自身知识的局限性，'知道何时不知道'的能力成为稳健可靠系统的标志。

Abstract: Machine learning has achieved remarkable successes, yet its deployment in
safety-critical domains remains hindered by an inherent inability to manage
uncertainty, resulting in overconfident and unreliable predictions when models
encounter out-of-distribution data, adversarial perturbations, or naturally
fluctuating environments. This thesis, titled Epistemic Deep Learning: Enabling
Machine Learning Models to 'Know When They Do Not Know', addresses these
critical challenges by advancing the paradigm of Epistemic Artificial
Intelligence, which explicitly models and quantifies epistemic uncertainty: the
uncertainty arising from limited, biased, or incomplete training data, as
opposed to the irreducible randomness of aleatoric uncertainty, thereby
empowering models to acknowledge their limitations and refrain from
overconfident decisions when uncertainty is high.
  Central to this work is the development of the Random-Set Neural Network
(RS-NN), a novel methodology that leverages random set theory to predict belief
functions over sets of classes, capturing the extent of epistemic uncertainty
through the width of associated credal sets, applications of RS-NN, including
its adaptation to Large Language Models (LLMs) and its deployment in weather
classification for autonomous racing. In addition, the thesis proposes a
unified evaluation framework for uncertainty-aware classifiers. Extensive
experiments validate that integrating epistemic awareness into deep learning
not only mitigates the risks associated with overconfident predictions but also
lays the foundation for a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, where the
ability to 'know when it does not know' becomes a hallmark of robust and
dependable systems. The title encapsulates the core philosophy of this work,
emphasizing that true intelligence involves recognizing and managing the limits
of one's own knowledge.

Result: 随机森林模型达到90.2%准确率和96.7% AUC，学校平均社会经济水平是最主要预测因子。

Conclusion: 学业表现是系统性现象，与学校生态系统密切相关，需要解决学校间差异来促进教育公平。

Abstract: Identifying the factors that influence student performance in basic education
is a central challenge for formulating effective public policies in Brazil.
This study introduces a multi-level machine learning approach to classify the
proficiency of 9th-grade and high school students using microdata from the
System of Assessment of Basic Education (SAEB). Our model uniquely integrates
four data sources: student socioeconomic characteristics, teacher professional
profiles, school indicators, and director management profiles. A comparative
analysis of four ensemble algorithms confirmed the superiority of a Random
Forest model, which achieved 90.2% accuracy and an Area Under the Curve (AUC)
of 96.7%. To move beyond prediction, we applied Explainable AI (XAI) using
SHAP, which revealed that the school's average socioeconomic level is the most
dominant predictor, demonstrating that systemic factors have a greater impact
than individual characteristics in isolation. The primary conclusion is that
academic performance is a systemic phenomenon deeply tied to the school's
ecosystem. This study provides a data-driven, interpretable tool to inform
policies aimed at promoting educational equity by addressing disparities
between schools.

Conclusion: 该框架可扩展部署到国家机构和低带宽地区，为政策制定者提供可操作的实时预警，增强家庭韧性并指导预防性干预策略。

Abstract: The growing instability of both global and domestic economic environments has
increased the risk of financial distress at the household level. However,
traditional econometric models often rely on delayed and aggregated data,
limiting their effectiveness. This study introduces a machine learning-based
early warning system that utilizes real-time digital and macroeconomic signals
to identify financial distress in near real-time. Using a panel dataset of 750
households tracked over three monitoring rounds spanning 13 months, the
framework combines socioeconomic attributes, macroeconomic indicators (such as
GDP growth, inflation, and foreign exchange fluctuations), and digital economy
measures (including ICT demand and market volatility). Through data
preprocessing and feature engineering, we introduce lagged variables,
volatility measures, and interaction terms to capture both gradual and sudden
changes in financial stability. We benchmark baseline classifiers, such as
logistic regression and decision trees, against advanced ensemble models
including random forests, XGBoost, and LightGBM. Our results indicate that the
engineered features from the digital economy significantly enhance predictive
accuracy. The system performs reliably for both binary distress detection and
multi-class severity classification, with SHAP-based explanations identifying
inflation volatility and ICT demand as key predictors. Crucially, the framework
is designed for scalable deployment in national agencies and low-bandwidth
regional offices, ensuring it is accessible for policymakers and practitioners.
By implementing machine learning in a transparent and interpretable manner,
this study demonstrates the feasibility and impact of providing near-real-time
early warnings of financial distress. This offers actionable insights that can
strengthen household resilience and guide preemptive intervention strategies.

fundamental property of real-world graphs, underpinning structural and semantic
patterns in domains such as citation networks and social networks. Existing
methods exploit homophily through designing homophily-aware GNN architectures
or graph structure learning strategies, yet they primarily focus on GNN
learning with training graphs. However, in real-world scenarios, test graphs
often suffer from data quality issues and distribution shifts, such as domain
shifts across users from different regions in social networks and temporal
evolution shifts in citation network graphs collected over varying time
periods. These factors significantly compromise the pre-trained model's
robustness, resulting in degraded test-time performance. With empirical
observations and theoretical analysis, we reveal that transforming the test
graph structure by increasing homophily in homophilic graphs or decreasing it
in heterophilic graphs can significantly improve the robustness and performance
of pre-trained GNNs on node classifications, without requiring model training
or update. Motivated by these insights, a novel test-time graph structural
transformation method grounded in homophily, named GrapHoST, is proposed.
Specifically, a homophily predictor is developed to discriminate test edges,
facilitating adaptive test-time graph structural transformation by the
confidence of predicted homophily scores. Extensive experiments on nine
benchmark datasets under a range of test-time data quality issues demonstrate
that GrapHoST consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, with
improvements of up to 10.92%. Our code has been released at

TL;DR: 开发了MASER预测模型，使用LASSO逻辑回归预测代谢功能障碍相关脂肪肝病，在大型电子健康记录数据库中实现了0.836的AUROC和77.6%的准确率，并通过公平性后处理减少了种族和民族亚组间的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MASLD影响约33%的美国成年人，是最常见的慢性肝病。早期检测很重要，因为生活方式干预可以预防疾病进展。需要开发公平、严谨且可重复的MASLD预测模型。

Method: 评估了LASSO逻辑回归、随机森林、XGBoost和神经网络，使用临床特征子集（包括前10个SHAP排名特征）。应用机会均等后处理方法减少种族和民族亚组间的真正率差异。

Result: LASSO逻辑回归模型在公平性调整前达到AUROC 0.84，准确率78%，敏感性72%，特异性79%，F1分数0.617。调整后准确率增至81%，特异性增至94%，但敏感性降至41%，F1分数降至0.515，反映了公平性权衡。

Conclusion: MASER预测模型实现了竞争性的MASLD预测性能，与先前报告的集成和基于树的模型相当。该方法表明可解释模型可以在多样化患者群体中实现预测性能和公平性的平衡。

Abstract: Background: Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD)
affects ~33% of U.S. adults and is the most common chronic liver disease.
Although often asymptomatic, progression can lead to cirrhosis. Early detection
is important, as lifestyle interventions can prevent disease progression. We
developed a fair, rigorous, and reproducible MASLD prediction model and
compared it to prior methods using a large electronic health record database.
  Methods: We evaluated LASSO logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost, and
a neural network for MASLD prediction using clinical feature subsets, including
the top 10 SHAP-ranked features. To reduce disparities in true positive rates
across racial and ethnic subgroups, we applied an equal opportunity
postprocessing method.
  Results: This study included 59,492 patients in the training data, 24,198 in
the validating data, and 25,188 in the testing data. The LASSO logistic
regression model with the top 10 features was selected for its interpretability
and comparable performance. Before fairness adjustment, the model achieved
AUROC of 0.84, accuracy of 78%, sensitivity of 72%, specificity of 79%, and
F1-score of 0.617. After equal opportunity postprocessing, accuracy modestly
increased to 81% and specificity to 94%, while sensitivity decreased to 41% and
F1-score to 0.515, reflecting the fairness trade-off.
  Conclusions: We developed the MASER prediction model (MASLD Static EHR Risk
Prediction), a LASSO logistic regression model which achieved competitive
performance for MASLD prediction (AUROC 0.836, accuracy 77.6%), comparable to
previously reported ensemble and tree-based models. Overall, this approach
demonstrates that interpretable models can achieve a balance of predictive
performance and fairness in diverse patient populations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前实验室检测依赖侵入性静脉采样且存在延迟，心电图作为非侵入性、广泛可用的信号，有望实现快速实验室指标估计。

Method: 使用迁移学习方法在斯坦福MC-MED数据集上微调ECGFounder大规模预训练心电图基础模型，生成了超过2000万个标准化十秒心电图片段。

Result: 内部验证显示，模型对33个实验室指标表现出强预测性能(AUC>0.65)，59个指标中等性能(0.55-0.65)，16个指标性能有限(<0.55)。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了高效的人工智能驱动解决方案，确立了实时非侵入性实验室值估计的可行性范围。

Abstract: Timely access to laboratory values is critical for clinical decision-making,
yet current approaches rely on invasive venous sampling and are intrinsically
delayed. Electrocardiography (ECG), as a non-invasive and widely available
signal, offers a promising modality for rapid laboratory estimation. Recent
progress in deep learning has enabled the extraction of latent hematological
signatures from ECGs. However, existing models are constrained by low
signal-to-noise ratios, substantial inter-individual variability, limited data
diversity, and suboptimal generalization, especially when adapted to low-lead
wearable devices. In this work, we conduct an exploratory study leveraging
transfer learning to fine-tune ECGFounder, a large-scale pre-trained ECG
foundation model, on the Multimodal Clinical Monitoring in the Emergency
Department (MC-MED) dataset from Stanford. We generated a corpus of more than
20 million standardized ten-second ECG segments to enhance sensitivity to
subtle biochemical correlates. On internal validation, the model demonstrated
strong predictive performance (area under the curve above 0.65) for
thirty-three laboratory indicators, moderate performance (between 0.55 and
0.65) for fifty-nine indicators, and limited performance (below 0.55) for
sixteen indicators. This study provides an efficient artificial-intelligence
driven solution and establishes the feasibility scope for real-time,
non-invasive estimation of laboratory values.

Motivation: 人类科学发现中的类比推理受限于领域专业知识和表面偏见，而LLMs拥有跨领域数据训练的优势，有望成为科学类比推理的未充分探索工具。

Method: 使用两种明确的类比推理策略：(1) 检索跨领域类比和类比引导的范例，引导探索超越传统掺杂替代；(2) 从少量标记示例构建领域内类比模板，指导针对性开发。

Result: 这些类比推理策略产生了超出既定组成空间的候选材料，并且在性能上优于标准提示基线方法。

Conclusion: LLMs可作为可解释的、类似专家的假设生成器，利用类比驱动的泛化能力推动科学创新。

Abstract: Analogical reasoning, the transfer of relational structures across contexts
(e.g., planet is to sun as electron is to nucleus), is fundamental to
scientific discovery. Yet human insight is often constrained by domain
expertise and surface-level biases, limiting access to deeper, structure-driven
analogies both within and across disciplines. Large language models (LLMs),
trained on vast cross-domain data, present a promising yet underexplored tool
for analogical reasoning in science. Here, we demonstrate that LLMs can
generate novel battery materials by (1) retrieving cross-domain analogs and
analogy-guided exemplars to steer exploration beyond conventional dopant
substitutions, and (2) constructing in-domain analogical templates from few
labeled examples to guide targeted exploitation. These explicit analogical
reasoning strategies yield candidates outside established compositional spaces
and outperform standard prompting baselines. Our findings position LLMs as
interpretable, expert-like hypothesis generators that leverage analogy-driven
generalization for scientific innovation.

TL;DR: 论文研究了节点状态监控问题，提出了一种基于预测不确定性的贪婪查询策略，分析了其在马尔可夫环境下的性能，并针对未知转移概率情况提出了学习变体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监控节点状态需要平衡查询成本和预测准确性，传统方法难以在不确定环境下做出最优查询决策。

Method: 采用贪婪策略，当预期预测损失低于查询成本时进行预测，否则查询；对于未知转移概率情况，提出基于投影随机梯度下降的学习变体。

Result: 贪婪策略在一般情况下可能次优且竞争比无界，但在同分布转移概率条件下接近最优；学习变体在预测-查询权衡和计算效率方面表现良好。

Conclusion: 贪婪策略在特定条件下是有效的近似方法，其学习变体为未知环境下的状态监控提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: We consider a node-monitor pair, where the node's state varies with time. The
monitor needs to track the node's state at all times; however, there is a fixed
cost for each state query. So the monitor may instead predict the state using
time-series forecasting methods, including time-series foundation models
(TSFMs), and query only when prediction uncertainty is high. Since query
decisions influence prediction accuracy, determining when to query is
nontrivial. A natural approach is a greedy policy that predicts when the
expected prediction loss is below the query cost and queries otherwise. We
analyze this policy in a Markovian setting, where the optimal (OPT) strategy is
a state-dependent threshold policy minimizing the time-averaged sum of query
cost and prediction losses. We show that, in general, the greedy policy is
suboptimal and can have an unbounded competitive ratio, but under common
conditions such as identically distributed transition probabilities, it
performs close to OPT. For the case of unknown transition probabilities, we
further propose a projected stochastic gradient descent (PSGD)-based learning
variant of the greedy policy, which achieves a favorable predict-query tradeoff
with improved computational efficiency compared to OPT.

TL;DR: 本文比较了稀疏自编码器(SAE)和原始前馈层(FF)的特征可解释性，发现两者在可解释性方面表现相似，SAE仅在部分方面有微小提升，甚至在某些方面FF表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型可解释性研究主要关注通过代理模块发现特征，但很少系统比较这些学习特征是否比原始模型参数中的特征具有更好的特性。

Method: 使用现代可解释性基准重新评估前馈层作为键值存储的特征向量可解释性，并与稀疏自编码器进行系统比较。

Result: SAE和FF在可解释性范围上相似，SAE在某些方面有微小改进，但某些方面FF甚至比SAE表现更好，且两者发现的特征存在分歧。

Conclusion: SAE在特征质量和忠实度方面的优势受到质疑，FF键值参数应作为现代可解释性研究的强基线。

Abstract: Recent interpretability work on large language models (LLMs) has been
increasingly dominated by a feature-discovery approach with the help of proxy
modules. Then, the quality of features learned by, e.g., sparse auto-encoders
(SAEs), is evaluated. This paradigm naturally raises a critical question: do
such learned features have better properties than those already represented
within the original model parameters, and unfortunately, only a few studies
have made such comparisons systematically so far. In this work, we revisit the
interpretability of feature vectors stored in feed-forward (FF) layers, given
the perspective of FF as key-value memories, with modern interpretability
benchmarks. Our extensive evaluation revealed that SAE and FFs exhibits a
similar range of interpretability, although SAEs displayed an observable but
minimal improvement in some aspects. Furthermore, in certain aspects,
surprisingly, even vanilla FFs yielded better interpretability than the SAEs,
and features discovered in SAEs and FFs diverged. These bring questions about
the advantage of SAEs from both perspectives of feature quality and
faithfulness, compared to directly interpreting FF feature vectors, and FF
key-value parameters serve as a strong baseline in modern interpretability
research.

Conclusion: 提出的四步部分贝叶斯框架成功解决了本构模型发现中的不确定性量化问题，无需先验选择且支持非线性模型发现。

Abstract: Constitutive model discovery refers to the task of identifying an appropriate
model structure, usually from a predefined model library, while simultaneously
inferring its material parameters. The data used for model discovery are
measured in mechanical tests and are thus inevitably affected by noise which,
in turn, induces uncertainties. Previously proposed methods for uncertainty
quantification in model discovery either require the selection of a prior for
the material parameters, are restricted to the linear coefficients of the model
library or are limited in the flexibility of the inferred parameter probability
distribution. We therefore propose a four-step partially Bayesian framework for
uncertainty quantification in model discovery that does not require prior
selection for the material parameters and also allows for the discovery of
non-linear constitutive models: First, we augment the available
stress-deformation data with a Gaussian process. Second, we approximate the
parameter distribution by a normalizing flow, which allows for capturing
complex joint distributions. Third, we distill the parameter distribution by
matching the distribution of stress-deformation functions induced by the
parameters with the Gaussian process posterior. Fourth, we perform a Sobol'
sensitivity analysis to obtain a sparse and interpretable model. We demonstrate
the capability of our framework for both isotropic and anisotropic experimental
data as well as linear and non-linear model libraries.

TL;DR: Concept Walk框架通过分析模型内部激活在概念方向上的演化，来评估推理轨迹的真实性，发现简单情况下推理轨迹是装饰性的，而困难情况下推理是真实的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有链式思维轨迹并不总是忠实反映模型的内部计算，可能导致实践者误将装饰性推理当作真实推理，需要更可靠的评估方法。

Method: 在激活空间中，将每个推理步骤投影到从对比数据学习的概念方向上，追踪模型内部立场随推理过程的演化。

Result: 在简单案例中，扰动的推理轨迹被快速忽略（装饰性推理）；在困难案例中，扰动引起内部激活的持续变化（忠实推理）。

Conclusion: Concept Walk提供了通过概念特定内部动态重新检验推理忠实性的方法，帮助识别何时可以信任推理轨迹，何时可能误导实践者。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) traces promise transparency for reasoning language
models, but prior work shows they are not always faithful reflections of
internal computation. This raises challenges for oversight: practitioners may
misinterpret decorative reasoning as genuine. We introduce Concept Walk, a
general framework for tracing how a model's internal stance evolves with
respect to a concept direction during reasoning. Unlike surface text, Concept
Walk operates in activation space, projecting each reasoning step onto the
concept direction learned from contrastive data. This allows us to observe
whether reasoning traces shape outcomes or are discarded. As a case study, we
apply Concept Walk to the domain of Safety using Qwen 3-4B. We find that in
'easy' cases, perturbed CoTs are quickly ignored, indicating decorative
reasoning, whereas in 'hard' cases, perturbations induce sustained shifts in
internal activations, consistent with faithful reasoning. The contribution is
methodological: Concept Walk provides a lens to re-examine faithfulness through
concept-specific internal dynamics, helping identify when reasoning traces can
be trusted and when they risk misleading practitioners.

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) systems are increasingly adopted in high-stakes
decision-making domains, ensuring fairness in their outputs has become a
central challenge. At the core of fair ML research are the datasets used to
investigate bias and develop mitigation strategies. Yet, much of the existing
work relies on a narrow selection of datasets--often arbitrarily chosen,
inconsistently processed, and lacking in diversity--undermining the
generalizability and reproducibility of results.
  To address these limitations, we present FairGround: a unified framework,
data corpus, and Python package aimed at advancing reproducible research and
critical data studies in fair ML classification. FairGround currently comprises
44 tabular datasets, each annotated with rich fairness-relevant metadata. Our
accompanying Python package standardizes dataset loading, preprocessing,
transformation, and splitting, streamlining experimental workflows. By
providing a diverse and well-documented dataset corpus along with robust
tooling, FairGround enables the development of fairer, more reliable, and more
reproducible ML models. All resources are publicly available to support open

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM遗忘技术中最直接的方法是梯度上升(GA)，但GA存在严重不稳定性，会导致模型效用大幅下降。需要一种更稳定的遗忘方法。

Method: SGA将遗忘数据与多个构造的正常数据通过可调节的平滑率相结合，从仅在遗忘数据上学习扩展到在遗忘和正常数据上联合学习。

Result: 在TOFU、Harry Potter和MUSE-NEWS三个基准测试中，SGA在所有指标上均优于原始GA方法，并在多个关键指标上达到所有基线方法的前2名性能。

Conclusion: SGA通过平滑处理有效解决了GA的不稳定性问题，在实现稳定遗忘的同时更好地保持了模型效用，并提供了最优平滑率选择的理论指导。

Abstract: LLM unlearning has emerged as a promising approach, aiming to enable models
to forget hazardous/undesired knowledge at low cost while preserving as much
model utility as possible. Among existing techniques, the most straightforward
method is performing Gradient Ascent (GA) w.r.t. the forget data, thereby
forcing the model to unlearn the forget dataset. However, GA suffers from
severe instability, as it drives updates in a divergent direction, often
resulting in drastically degraded model utility. To address this issue, we
propose Smoothed Gradient Ascent (SGA). SGA combines the forget data with
multiple constructed normal data through a tunable smoothing rate. Intuitively,
this extends GA from learning solely on the forget data to jointly learning
across both forget and normal data, enabling more stable unlearning while
better preserving model utility. Theoretically, we provide the theoretical
guidance on the selection of the optimal smoothing rate. Empirically, we
evaluate SGA on three benchmarks: TOFU, Harry Potter, and MUSE-NEWS.
Experimental results demonstrate that SGA consistently outperforms the original
Gradient Ascent (GA) method across all metrics and achieves top-2 performance
among all baseline methods on several key metrics.

Conclusion: 基于生命游戏的动态单元失活是有效的正则化替代方案，适用于深层架构并能增强不同dropout技术的性能。

Abstract: Regularization techniques play a crucial role in preventing overfitting and
improving the generalization performance of neural networks. Dropout, a widely
used regularization technique, randomly deactivates units during training to
introduce redundancy and prevent co-adaptation among neurons. Despite its
effectiveness, dropout has limitations, such as its static nature and lack of
interpretability. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to regularization
by substituting dropout with Conway's Game of Life (GoL), a cellular automata
with simple rules that govern the evolution of a grid of cells. We introduce
dynamic unit deactivation during training by representing neural network units
as cells in a GoL grid and applying the game's rules to deactivate units. This
approach allows for the emergence of spatial patterns that adapt to the
training data, potentially enhancing the network's ability to generalize. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the CIFAR-10 dataset, showing
that dynamic unit deactivation using GoL achieves comparable performance to
traditional dropout techniques while offering insights into the network's
behavior through the visualization of evolving patterns. Furthermore, our
discussion highlights the applicability of our proposal in deeper
architectures, demonstrating how it enhances the performance of different
dropout techniques.

Motivation: 在线平台用户行为不断变化导致数据漂移，使模型性能随时间下降。持续微调会引发灾难性遗忘，而回放方法受限于固定缓冲区大小。

Method: 在回放式持续学习框架中引入基于外部知识库的数据增强策略，通过整合额外知识来克服缓冲区容量限制。

Result: 在三个异常行为分类数据集上的评估表明，增强方法优于基线回放方法，能更好地处理数据漂移问题。

Conclusion: 将外部知识整合到回放式持续学习中能有效缓解灾难性遗忘，提升模型对动态用户行为的适应能力。

Abstract: User behavior on online platforms is evolving, reflecting real-world changes
in how people post, whether it's helpful messages or hate speech. Models that
learn to capture this content can experience a decrease in performance over
time due to data drift, which can lead to ineffective behavioral analytics
systems. However, fine-tuning such a model over time with new data can be
detrimental due to catastrophic forgetting. Replay-based approaches in
continual learning offer a simple yet efficient method to update such models,
minimizing forgetting by maintaining a buffer of important training instances
from past learned tasks. However, the main limitation of this approach is the
fixed size of the buffer. External knowledge bases can be utilized to overcome
this limitation through data augmentation. We propose a novel
augmentation-based approach to incorporate external knowledge in the
replay-based continual learning framework. We evaluate several strategies with
three datasets from prior studies related to deviant behavior classification to
assess the integration of external knowledge in continual learning and
demonstrate that augmentation helps outperform baseline replay-based
approaches.

Result: 在温和的矩和谱隙假设下，批处理版本在两种量化方案下都能达到下界（最多相差对数因子），非线性量化设置下实现了几乎与维度无关的量化误差。

Conclusion: 低精度方法能够紧密跟踪标准Oja算法的性能，验证了理论发现，表明在流式PCA中有效使用低精度量化的可行性。

Abstract: Low-precision streaming PCA estimates the top principal component in a
streaming setting under limited precision. We establish an
information-theoretic lower bound on the quantization resolution required to
achieve a target accuracy for the leading eigenvector. We study Oja's algorithm
for streaming PCA under linear and nonlinear stochastic quantization. The
quantized variants use unbiased stochastic quantization of the weight vector
and the updates. Under mild moment and spectral-gap assumptions on the data
distribution, we show that a batched version achieves the lower bound up to
logarithmic factors under both schemes. This leads to a nearly dimension-free
quantization error in the nonlinear quantization setting. Empirical evaluations
on synthetic streams validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate that our
low-precision methods closely track the performance of standard Oja's
algorithm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数神经网络架构仍然依赖固定、统一的激活函数，但激活函数的选择对网络性能至关重要。

Method: 第一阶段：神经元通过可微分硬混合机制从候选激活函数池（ReLU、Sigmoid、Tanh、Leaky ReLU、ELU、SELU）中自适应选择；第二阶段：根据学习到的选择固定每个神经元的激活函数，形成计算高效的网络。

Result: 在MNIST数据集上的评估显示，不同层的神经元对激活函数表现出不同的偏好，揭示了神经网络架构中的功能多样性。

Conclusion: SmartMixed策略能够有效学习每个神经元的最优激活函数，同时保持推理效率，为神经网络激活函数选择提供了新思路。

Abstract: The choice of activation function plays a critical role in neural networks,
yet most architectures still rely on fixed, uniform activation functions across
all neurons. We introduce SmartMixed, a two-phase training strategy that allows
networks to learn optimal per-neuron activation functions while preserving
computational efficiency at inference. In the first phase, neurons adaptively
select from a pool of candidate activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh,
Leaky ReLU, ELU, SELU) using a differentiable hard-mixture mechanism. In the
second phase, each neuron's activation function is fixed according to the
learned selection, resulting in a computationally efficient network that
supports continued training with optimized vectorized operations. We evaluate
SmartMixed on the MNIST dataset using feedforward neural networks of varying
depths. The analysis shows that neurons in different layers exhibit distinct
preferences for activation functions, providing insights into the functional
diversity within neural architectures.

Conclusion: GraphTOP是首个拓扑导向的图提示框架，通过边重连方法有效提升了预训练GNN在下游任务中的适应性能。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have revolutionized the field of graph learning
by learning expressive graph representations from massive graph data. As a
common pattern to train powerful GNNs, the "pre-training, adaptation" scheme
first pre-trains GNNs over unlabeled graph data and subsequently adapts them to
specific downstream tasks. In the adaptation phase, graph prompting is an
effective strategy that modifies input graph data with learnable prompts while
keeping pre-trained GNN models frozen. Typically, existing graph prompting
studies mainly focus on *feature-oriented* methods that apply graph prompts to
node features or hidden representations. However, these studies often achieve
suboptimal performance, as they consistently overlook the potential of
*topology-oriented* prompting, which adapts pre-trained GNNs by modifying the
graph topology. In this study, we conduct a pioneering investigation of graph
prompting in terms of graph topology. We propose the first **Graph**
**T**opology-**O**riented **P**rompting (GraphTOP) framework to effectively
adapt pre-trained GNN models for downstream tasks. More specifically, we
reformulate topology-oriented prompting as an edge rewiring problem within
multi-hop local subgraphs and relax it into the continuous probability space
through reparameterization while ensuring tight relaxation and preserving graph
sparsity. Extensive experiments on five graph datasets under four pre-training
strategies demonstrate that our proposed GraphTOP outshines six baselines on
multiple node classification datasets. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GradLite是一种向后友好的优化器，通过放松对精确梯度的要求，在积极丢弃或近似中间激活时实现高效训练，减少内存消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统优化器如SGD或Adam需要基于缓存激活的精确梯度，导致大语言模型全微调时内存消耗巨大。现有解决方案要么改变模型架构，要么以计算换内存，但优化器本身未被触及。

Method: GradLite采用两种关键技术：(i)低秩雅可比近似，降低反向传播误差信号的维度；(ii)误差反馈校正，在迭代中累积和补偿近似误差以保持收敛保证。

Result: GradLite将优化器状态和激活内存消耗减少高达50%，无需架构更改，在推理、多语言和对话基准测试中达到与检查点和优化器中心基线相当或更优的性能。

Conclusion: GradLite通过放松精确梯度要求，提供了一种内存高效的优化器解决方案，在保持收敛性能的同时显著减少内存消耗。

Abstract: Full fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is notoriously
memory-intensive, primarily because conventional optimizers such as SGD or Adam
assume access to exact gradients derived from cached activations. Existing
solutions either alter the model architecture (e.g., reversible networks) or
trade memory for computation (e.g., activation checkpointing), but the
optimizer itself remains untouched. In this work, we introduce GradLite, a
backward-friendly optimizer that relaxes the requirement of exact gradients,
enabling efficient training even when intermediate activations are aggressively
discarded or approximated. GradLite leverages two key techniques: (i) low-rank
Jacobian approximation, which reduces the dimensionality of backpropagated
error signals, and (ii) error-feedback correction, which accumulates and
compensates approximation errors across iterations to preserve convergence
guarantees. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that GradLite maintains
unbiased gradient estimates with bounded variance, ensuring convergence rates
comparable to Adam. Empirically, GradLite reduces optimizer-state and
activation memory consumption by up to 50\% without architectural changes, and
achieves on-par or superior downstream performance on reasoning (MMLU, GSM8K),
multilingual, and dialogue benchmarks compared to checkpointing and
optimizer-centric baselines (LoMo, GaLore).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于多向量图表示的方法虽然能提供准确的子图同构测试，但由于需要穷举评分，在大规模图检索中效率受限。

Method: 使用上下文密集图表示，通过可微分离散化模块计算稀疏二进制码，映射到学习的潜在词汇表，并利用倒排索引支持软集合包含评分。

Result: 实验表明CORGII在准确性和效率之间提供了比多个基线方法更好的权衡。

Conclusion: CORGII是首个使用离散标记映射到高效倒排列表的密集图表示索引器，为图检索提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieving graphs from a large corpus, that contain a subgraph isomorphic to
a given query graph, is a core operation in many real-world applications. While
recent multi-vector graph representations and scores based on set alignment and
containment can provide accurate subgraph isomorphism tests, their use in
retrieval remains limited by their need to score corpus graphs exhaustively. We
introduce CORGII (Contextual Representation of Graphs for Inverted Indexing), a
graph indexing framework in which, starting with a contextual dense graph
representation, a differentiable discretization module computes sparse binary
codes over a learned latent vocabulary. This text document-like representation
allows us to leverage classic, highly optimized inverted indices, while
supporting soft (vector) set containment scores. Pushing this paradigm further,
we replace the classical, fixed impact weight of a `token' on a graph (such as
TFIDF or BM25) with a data-driven, trainable impact weight. Finally, we explore
token expansion to support multi-probing the index for smoother
accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs. To our knowledge, CORGII is the first indexer of
dense graph representations using discrete tokens mapping to efficient inverted
lists. Extensive experiments show that CORGII provides better trade-offs
between accuracy and efficiency, compared to several baselines.

TL;DR: LAMP是一个数据高效的3D生成框架，通过线性仿射混合参数化形状，实现可控、可解释的3D几何生成，支持插值、外推和物理性能优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前3D生成方法依赖大数据集、可控性差、泛化能力有限的问题，为设计和工程应用提供更高效可控的3D生成方案。

Method: 首先通过共享初始化对齐SDF解码器，然后在对齐的权重空间中求解参数约束的混合问题，并引入线性度不匹配的安全指标检测几何有效性。

Result: 在DrivAerNet++和BlendedNet基准测试中，LAMP仅需100个样本即可实现边界内可控插值，支持超出训练范围100%参数差异的安全外推，并在固定参数下进行物理性能优化，显著优于条件自编码器和DNI基线。

Conclusion: LAMP推动了可控、数据高效且安全的3D生成技术，适用于设计探索、数据集生成和性能驱动优化等应用。

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity 3D geometries that satisfy specific parameter
constraints has broad applications in design and engineering. However, current
methods typically rely on large training datasets and struggle with
controllability and generalization beyond the training distributions. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce LAMP (Linear Affine Mixing of
Parametric shapes), a data-efficient framework for controllable and
interpretable 3D generation. LAMP first aligns signed distance function (SDF)
decoders by overfitting each exemplar from a shared initialization, then
synthesizes new geometries by solving a parameter-constrained mixing problem in
the aligned weight space. To ensure robustness, we further propose a safety
metric that detects geometry validity via linearity mismatch. We evaluate LAMP
on two 3D parametric benchmarks: DrivAerNet++ and BlendedNet. We found that
LAMP enables (i) controlled interpolation within bounds with as few as 100
samples, (ii) safe extrapolation by up to 100% parameter difference beyond
training ranges, (iii) physics performance-guided optimization under fixed
parameters. LAMP significantly outperforms conditional autoencoder and Deep
Network Interpolation (DNI) baselines in both extrapolation and data
efficiency. Our results demonstrate that LAMP advances controllable,
data-efficient, and safe 3D generation for design exploration, dataset
generation, and performance-driven optimization.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于互补标签的可扩展监督框架，用于评估和训练前沿AI系统，无需真实标签，利用人类专家的领域知识提供弱信号（指出错误选项）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统在复杂任务上超越人类专家，获取高质量人工监督变得困难。人类专家通常只精通单一领域，无法评估AI在超人类任务上的表现，但可以提供互补标签来指出错误选项。

Method: 从互补标签推导出top-1准确率的无偏估计器，量化所需互补标签数量；引入两种估计器结合稀缺普通标签和丰富互补标签；提供有限样本偏差保证。

Result: 实证表明，使用互补标签可以在没有真实标签的情况下评估大语言模型的输出，并能训练出性能更好的AI系统。

Conclusion: 通过分区式人工监督，可以有效地评估和训练前沿AI系统，解决了高质量人工监督稀缺的问题。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) systems approach and surpass expert human
performance across a broad range of tasks, obtaining high-quality human
supervision for evaluation and training becomes increasingly challenging. Our
focus is on tasks that require deep knowledge and skills of multiple domains.
Unfortunately, even the best human experts are knowledgeable only in a single
narrow area, and will not be able to evaluate the correctness of advanced AI
systems on such superhuman tasks. However, based on their narrow expertise,
humans may provide a weak signal, i.e., a complementary label indicating an
option that is incorrect. For example, a cardiologist could state that "this is
not related to cardiology,'' even if they cannot identify the true disease.
Based on this weak signal, we propose a scalable oversight framework that
enables us to evaluate frontier AI systems without the need to prepare the
ground truth. We derive an unbiased estimator of top-1 accuracy from
complementary labels and quantify how many complementary labels are needed to
match the variance of ordinary labels. We further introduce two estimators to
combine scarce ordinary labels with abundant complementary labels. We provide
finite-sample deviation guarantees for both complementary-only and the mixed
estimators. Empirically, we show that we can evaluate the output of large
language models without the ground truth, if we have complementary labels. We
further show that we can train an AI system with such weak signals: we show how
we can design an agentic AI system automatically that can perform better with
this partitioned human supervision. Our code is available at

Motivation: 材料发现需要在广阔的化学和结构空间中导航，同时满足多个往往相互冲突的目标，传统方法效率低下

Method: LLEMA框架将LLM的科学知识嵌入与化学进化规则和基于记忆的优化相结合，通过迭代生成候选材料、代理模型评估物理化学性质、多目标评分器更新成功/失败记忆来指导后续代际

Result: 在14个现实任务中，LLEMA发现的候选材料化学上合理、热力学稳定且性质对齐，比生成式和纯LLM基线获得更高的命中率和更强的帕累托前沿

Conclusion: LLEMA通过强制执行可合成性和多目标权衡，为加速实际材料发现提供了原则性途径

Abstract: Materials discovery requires navigating vast chemical and structural spaces
while satisfying multiple, often conflicting, objectives. We present LLM-guided
Evolution for MAterials design (LLEMA), a unified framework that couples the
scientific knowledge embedded in large language models with chemistry-informed
evolutionary rules and memory-based refinement. At each iteration, an LLM
proposes crystallographically specified candidates under explicit property
constraints; a surrogate-augmented oracle estimates physicochemical properties;
and a multi-objective scorer updates success/failure memories to guide
subsequent generations. Evaluated on 14 realistic tasks spanning electronics,
energy, coatings, optics, and aerospace, LLEMA discovers candidates that are
chemically plausible, thermodynamically stable, and property-aligned, achieving
higher hit-rates and stronger Pareto fronts than generative and LLM-only
baselines. Ablation studies confirm the importance of rule-guided generation,
memory-based refinement, and surrogate prediction. By enforcing
synthesizability and multi-objective trade-offs, LLEMA delivers a principled
pathway to accelerate practical materials discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了CANDI混合扩散框架，解决连续扩散在离散数据上表现不佳的问题，通过解耦离散和连续噪声机制，在文本生成等任务中取得优异表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连续扩散在连续域（如图像生成）表现出色，但在离散数据上表现不如纯离散方法，这种差距与直觉相悖，因为连续扩散能够学习跨多个位置的联合演化分数函数。

Method: 提出CANDI混合框架，将离散身份损坏和连续秩退化两种噪声机制解耦，同时学习条件结构和连续几何特征，避免了时间不协调问题。

Result: 实证验证了时间不协调现象，CANDI成功避免了该问题，在控制生成中支持分类器引导，在文本生成中在低NFE下优于掩码扩散。

Conclusion: CANDI解锁了连续扩散在离散空间中的优势，证明了学习连续梯度对离散空间的价值，为离散数据生成提供了新的有效方法。

Abstract: While continuous diffusion has shown remarkable success in continuous domains
such as image generation, its direct application to discrete data has
underperformed compared to purely discrete formulations. This gap is
counterintuitive, given that continuous diffusion learns score functions that
enable joint evolution across multiple positions. To understand this gap, we
introduce token identifiability as an analytical framework for understanding
how Gaussian noise corrupts discrete data through two mechanisms: discrete
identity corruption and continuous rank degradation. We reveal that these
mechanisms scale differently with vocabulary size, creating a temporal
dissonance: at noise levels where discrete corruption preserves enough
structure for conditional learning, continuous denoising is trivial; at noise
levels where continuous denoising is meaningful, discrete corruption destroys
nearly all conditional structure. To solve this, we propose CANDI (Continuous
ANd DIscrete diffusion), a hybrid framework that decouples discrete and
continuous corruption, enabling simultaneous learning of both conditional
structure and continuous geometry. We empirically validate the temporal
dissonance phenomenon and demonstrate that CANDI successfully avoids it. This
unlocks the benefits of continuous diffusion for discrete spaces: on controlled
generation, CANDI enables classifier-based guidance with off-the-shelf
classifiers through simple gradient addition; on text generation, CANDI
outperforms masked diffusion at low NFE, demonstrating the value of learning
continuous gradients for discrete spaces.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决离线目标条件强化学习中寻找从任意状态到达其他状态的最短路径策略的问题，克服传统TD方法偏差累积和蒙特卡洛方法高方差的局限性。

Method: 将GCRL中的三角不等式结构转化为实用的分治值更新规则，通过分治策略减少递归次数，实现动态规划。

Result: 在具有挑战性的长视野基准任务中，TRL相比之前的离线GCRL算法取得了最佳性能。

Conclusion: TRL算法通过分治范式有效解决了离线GCRL中的值学习问题，在偏差控制和方差减少方面优于传统方法。

Abstract: In this work, we present Transitive Reinforcement Learning (TRL), a new value
learning algorithm based on a divide-and-conquer paradigm. TRL is designed for
offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) problems, where the aim
is to find a policy that can reach any state from any other state in the
smallest number of steps. TRL converts a triangle inequality structure present
in GCRL into a practical divide-and-conquer value update rule. This has several
advantages compared to alternative value learning paradigms. Compared to
temporal difference (TD) methods, TRL suffers less from bias accumulation, as
in principle it only requires $O(\log T)$ recursions (as opposed to $O(T)$ in
TD learning) to handle a length-$T$ trajectory. Unlike Monte Carlo methods, TRL
suffers less from high variance as it performs dynamic programming.
Experimentally, we show that TRL achieves the best performance in highly
challenging, long-horizon benchmark tasks compared to previous offline GCRL
algorithms.

Motivation: 现实世界符号图中存在噪声连接，现有符号图神经网络缺乏理论指导的鲁棒性研究，需要同时处理输入空间和目标空间中的噪声。

Method: 扩展图信息瓶颈理论，使其具备目标空间去噪能力，通过重参数化机制和变分近似构建可处理的优化目标函数，联合净化输入数据和监督目标。

Conclusion: RIDGE框架通过理论指导的联合去噪方法有效增强了符号图神经网络的鲁棒性，为符号图学习提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Signed Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs) are widely adopted to analyze complex
patterns in signed graphs with both positive and negative links. Given the
noisy nature of real-world connections, the robustness of SGNN has also emerged
as a pivotal research area. Under the supervision of empirical properties,
graph structure learning has shown its robustness on signed graph
representation learning, however, there remains a paucity of research
investigating a robust SGNN with theoretical guidance. Inspired by the success
of graph information bottleneck (GIB) in information extraction, we propose
RIDGE, a novel framework for Robust sI gned graph learning through joint
Denoising of Graph inputs and supervision targEts. Different from the basic
GIB, we extend the GIB theory with the capability of target space denoising as
the co-existence of noise in both input and target spaces. In instantiation,
RIDGE effectively cleanses input data and supervision targets via a tractable
objective function produced by reparameterization mechanism and variational
approximation. We extensively validate our method on four prevalent signed
graph datasets, and the results show that RIDGE clearly improves the robustness
of popular SGNN models under various levels of noise.

Motivation: 约束聚类利用领域知识提升聚类性能，但融入成对约束是NP难问题，现有方法局限于小规模数据集

Method: 将必须链接样本压缩为基于质心的伪样本，通过几何规则修剪不能链接，结合分组样本拉格朗日分解和几何消除规则

Result: 能处理20万个样本的不能链接约束和150万个样本的必须链接约束，比现有方法规模大200-1500倍，最优性差距小于3%

Conclusion: 该方法提供了确定性全局保证，避免了现成启发式方法在大数据集上的搜索失败问题

Abstract: Constrained clustering leverages limited domain knowledge to improve
clustering performance and interpretability, but incorporating pairwise
must-link and cannot-link constraints is an NP-hard challenge, making global
optimization intractable. Existing mixed-integer optimization methods are
confined to small-scale datasets, limiting their utility. We propose
Sample-Driven Constrained Group-Based Branch-and-Bound (SDC-GBB), a
decomposable branch-and-bound (BB) framework that collapses must-linked samples
into centroid-based pseudo-samples and prunes cannot-link through geometric
rules, while preserving convergence and guaranteeing global optimality. By
integrating grouped-sample Lagrangian decomposition and geometric elimination
rules for efficient lower and upper bounds, the algorithm attains highly
scalable pairwise k-Means constrained clustering via parallelism. Experimental
results show that our approach handles datasets with 200,000 samples with
cannot-link constraints and 1,500,000 samples with must-link constraints, which
is 200 - 1500 times larger than the current state-of-the-art under comparable
constraint settings, while reaching an optimality gap of less than 3%. In
providing deterministic global guarantees, our method also avoids the search
failures that off-the-shelf heuristics often encounter on large datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机游走神经网络在现实采样约束下往往无法捕捉图的全局结构，因为节点和边覆盖不完整，限制了其表达能力。

Method: 提出随机搜索神经网络，每个随机搜索保证完整的节点覆盖，理论上在稀疏图中仅需O(log|V|)次搜索即可实现完整边覆盖。

Result: RSNNs在分子和蛋白质基准测试中始终优于RWNNs，使用最多16倍更少的采样序列就能达到相当或更优的性能。

Conclusion: RSNNs为基于随机游走的方法提供了高效且表达能力强的框架，在稀疏图学习中具有理论和实践优势。

Abstract: Random walk neural networks (RWNNs) have emerged as a promising approach for
graph representation learning, leveraging recent advances in sequence models to
process random walks. However, under realistic sampling constraints, RWNNs
often fail to capture global structure even in small graphs due to incomplete
node and edge coverage, limiting their expressivity. To address this, we
propose \textit{random search neural networks} (RSNNs), which operate on random
searches, each of which guarantees full node coverage. Theoretically, we
demonstrate that in sparse graphs, only $O(\log |V|)$ searches are needed to
achieve full edge coverage, substantially reducing sampling complexity compared
to the $O(|V|)$ walks required by RWNNs (assuming walk lengths scale with graph
size). Furthermore, when paired with universal sequence models, RSNNs are
universal approximators. We lastly show RSNNs are probabilistically invariant
to graph isomorphisms, ensuring their expectation is an isomorphism-invariant
graph function. Empirically, RSNNs consistently outperform RWNNs on molecular
and protein benchmarks, achieving comparable or superior performance with up to
16$\times$ fewer sampled sequences. Our work bridges theoretical and practical
advances in random walk based approaches, offering an efficient and expressive
framework for learning on sparse graphs.

Motivation: 现有的子图同构检索方法如IsoNet采用后期交互模型，独立计算图嵌入后再进行对齐。为了提升检索性能，需要开发早期交互模型，在嵌入计算过程中直接考虑图间关系。

Method: 1. 在输入图之间进行跨图消息传递，基于节点间的单射对齐；2. 多轮惰性对齐更新，每轮基于当前对齐状态从头运行GNN；3. 引入节点对交互概念，考虑节点对而非单个节点作为潜在伙伴。

Conclusion: IsoNet++通过早期交互、惰性对齐更新和节点对交互等创新，实现了比现有方法更好的子图匹配检索性能。

Abstract: Graph retrieval based on subgraph isomorphism has several real-world
applications such as scene graph retrieval, molecular fingerprint detection and
circuit design. Roy et al. [35] proposed IsoNet, a late interaction model for
subgraph matching, which first computes the node and edge embeddings of each
graph independently of paired graph and then computes a trainable alignment
map. Here, we present IsoNet++, an early interaction graph neural network
(GNN), based on several technical innovations. First, we compute embeddings of
all nodes by passing messages within and across the two input graphs, guided by
an injective alignment between their nodes. Second, we update this alignment in
a lazy fashion over multiple rounds. Within each round, we run a layerwise GNN
from scratch, based on the current state of the alignment. After the completion
of one round of GNN, we use the last-layer embeddings to update the alignments,
and proceed to the next round. Third, IsoNet++ incorporates a novel notion of
node-pair partner interaction. Traditional early interaction computes attention
between a node and its potential partners in the other graph, the attention
then controlling messages passed across graphs. In contrast, we consider node
pairs (not single nodes) as potential partners. Existence of an edge between
the nodes in one graph and non-existence in the other provide vital signals for
refining the alignment. Our experiments on several datasets show that the
alignments get progressively refined with successive rounds, resulting in
significantly better retrieval performance than existing methods. We
demonstrate that all three innovations contribute to the enhanced accuracy. Our
code and datasets are publicly available at

TL;DR: 本文提出FAPO方法，通过检测和惩罚有缺陷的推理轨迹来解决RLVR中错误推理模式被强化的问题，提高推理可靠性和训练稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在RLVR中，模型会探索推理轨迹并利用正确答案作为正信号进行策略优化。然而这些轨迹可能包含答案猜测和跳跃推理等有缺陷的模式，这些有缺陷的正向轨迹与完全正确的轨迹获得相同奖励，导致策略模型内化不可靠的推理模式。

Method: 提出FAPO方法：1）对缺陷正向轨迹进行参数无关的奖励惩罚；2）引入具有过程级奖励的生成式奖励模型来准确定位推理错误；3）在预热阶段利用缺陷轨迹作为有用捷径，在后期细化阶段转向可靠推理。

Result: 实验表明FAPO在多个领域有效，提高了结果正确性、过程可靠性和训练稳定性，且不增加token预算。

Conclusion: FAPO能够有效解决RLVR中缺陷正向轨迹的问题，使模型既能获得早期能力提升，又能避免内化不可靠推理模式，实现更稳定的训练和更可靠的推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
promising paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). In this context, models explore reasoning trajectories and
exploit rollouts with correct answers as positive signals for policy
optimization. However, these rollouts might involve flawed patterns such as
answer-guessing and jump-in-reasoning. Such flawed-positive rollouts are
rewarded identically to fully correct ones, causing policy models to
internalize these unreliable reasoning patterns. In this work, we first conduct
a systematic study of flawed-positive rollouts in RL and find that they enable
rapid capability gains during the early optimization stage, while constraining
reasoning capability later by reinforcing unreliable patterns. Building on
these insights, we propose Flawed-Aware Policy Optimization (FAPO), which
presents a parameter-free reward penalty for flawed-positive rollouts, enabling
the policy to leverage them as useful shortcuts in the warm-up stage, securing
stable early gains, while gradually shifting optimization toward reliable
reasoning in the later refinement stage. To accurately and comprehensively
detect flawed-positive rollouts, we introduce a generative reward model (GenRM)
with a process-level reward that precisely localizes reasoning errors.
Experiments show that FAPO is effective in broad domains, improving outcome
correctness, process reliability, and training stability without increasing the
token budget.

Conclusion: 该方法在随机轨迹恢复任务中表现出色，特别是在高噪声环境下，为理解非确定性过程系统提供了可靠手段。

Abstract: With recent technological advances, process logs, which were traditionally
deterministic in nature, are being captured from non-deterministic sources,
such as uncertain sensors or machine learning models (that predict activities
using cameras). In the presence of stochastically-known logs, logs that contain
probabilistic information, the need for stochastic trace recovery increases, to
offer reliable means of understanding the processes that govern such systems.
We design a novel deep learning approach for stochastic trace recovery, based
on Diffusion Denoising Probabilistic Models (DDPM), which makes use of process
knowledge (either implicitly by discovering a model or explicitly by injecting
process knowledge in the training phase) to recover traces by denoising. We
conduct an empirical evaluation demonstrating state-of-the-art performance with
up to a 25% improvement over existing methods, along with increased robustness
under high noise levels.

*Dhruv Sarkar,Abhishek Sinha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于学习对抗性凸成本函数序列的随时在线算法，同时近似满足另一序列的对抗性在线凸约束。该算法无需预知时间范围长度T，即可在任何中间时间步t提供非平凡性能保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有算法通常需要预知时间范围长度T，或使用性能较差的加倍技巧。本文旨在开发无需预知T的随时算法，避免因多次重启导致的性能下降。

Method: 使用时间变化的Lyapunov函数来跟踪约束违反情况，而非传统固定Lyapunov函数。引入新的分析技术来处理时间变化Lyapunov函数带来的挑战。

Result: 算法在任何t≥1时实现O(√t)遗憾和Õ(√t)累积约束违反界。扩展到动态遗憾设置，无需预知比较器序列的总长度即可适应其路径长度。

Conclusion: 提出的随时算法在理论和实践中都表现出色，为在线约束优化问题提供了有效的解决方案，特别适用于需要适应未知时间范围的应用场景。

Abstract: We propose an anytime online algorithm for the problem of learning a sequence
of adversarial convex cost functions while approximately satisfying another
sequence of adversarial online convex constraints. A sequential algorithm is
called \emph{anytime} if it provides a non-trivial performance guarantee for
any intermediate timestep $t$ without requiring prior knowledge of the length
of the entire time horizon $T$. Our proposed algorithm achieves optimal
performance bounds without resorting to the standard doubling trick, which has
poor practical performance due to multiple restarts. Our core technical
contribution is the use of time-varying Lyapunov functions to keep track of
constraint violations. This must be contrasted with prior works that used a
fixed Lyapunov function tuned to the known horizon length $T$. The use of
time-varying Lyapunov function poses unique analytical challenges as
properties, such as \emph{monotonicity}, on which the prior proofs rest, no
longer hold. By introducing a new analytical technique, we show that our
algorithm achieves $O(\sqrt{t})$ regret and $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{t})$ cumulative
constraint violation bounds for any $t\geq 1$.
  We extend our results to the dynamic regret setting, achieving bounds that
adapt to the path length of the comparator sequence without prior knowledge of
its total length. We also present an adaptive algorithm in the optimistic
setting, whose performance gracefully scales with the cumulative prediction
error. We demonstrate the practical utility of our algorithm through numerical
experiments involving the online shortest path problem.

Conclusion: 将PPI扩展到半监督学习训练过程，通过在线动态调整权重，有效提升了模型性能

Abstract: Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI) is a recently proposed statistical
inference technique for parameter estimation that leverages pseudo-labels on
both labeled and unlabeled data to construct an unbiased, low-variance
estimator. In this work, we extend its core idea to semi-supervised learning
(SSL) for model training, introducing a novel unbiased gradient estimator. This
extension addresses a key challenge in SSL: while unlabeled data can improve
model performance, its benefit heavily depends on the quality of pseudo-labels.
Inaccurate pseudo-labels can introduce bias, leading to suboptimal models.To
balance the contributions of labeled and pseudo-labeled data, we utilize an
interpolation parameter and tune it on the fly, alongside the model parameters,
using a one-dimensional online learning algorithm. We verify the practical
advantage of our approach through experiments on both synthetic and real
datasets, demonstrating improved performance over classic SSL baselines and PPI
methods that tune the interpolation parameter offline.

Abstract: Geometric data analysis and learning has emerged as a distinct and rapidly
developing research area, increasingly recognized for its effectiveness across
diverse applications. At the heart of this field lies curvature, a powerful and
interpretable concept that captures intrinsic geometric structure and underpins
numerous tasks, from community detection to geometric deep learning. A wide
range of discrete curvature models have been proposed for various data
representations, including graphs, simplicial complexes, cubical complexes, and
point clouds sampled from manifolds. These models not only provide efficient
characterizations of data geometry but also constitute essential components in
geometric learning frameworks. In this paper, we present the first
comprehensive review of existing discrete curvature models, covering their
mathematical foundations, computational formulations, and practical
applications in data analysis and learning. In particular, we discuss discrete
curvature from both Riemannian and metric geometry perspectives and propose a
systematic pipeline for curvature-driven data analysis. We further examine the
corresponding computational algorithms across different data representations,
offering detailed comparisons and insights. Finally, we review state-of-the-art
applications of curvature in both supervised and unsupervised learning. This
survey provides a conceptual and practical roadmap for researchers to gain a
better understanding of discrete curvature as a fundamental tool for geometric
understanding and learning.

TL;DR: CLEANet是一个针对受污染多元时间序列的鲁棒高效异常检测框架，通过污染弹性训练框架和轻量级共轭MLP解决训练数据污染和推理效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中多元时间序列异常检测面临两个关键挑战：训练数据污染（噪声和隐藏异常）导致学习模式失真，以及复杂深度模型过拟合污染数据且推理延迟高，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出污染弹性训练框架（CRTF），通过自适应重构加权策略结合聚类引导的对比学习来减轻污染样本影响；设计轻量级共轭MLP解耦时间和跨特征依赖关系，避免过拟合并提高计算效率。

Result: 在五个公共数据集上，CLEANet相比十个最先进基线方法，F1分数最高提升73.04%，运行时间降低81.28%；将CRTF集成到三个先进模型中平均获得5.35%的F1增益。

Conclusion: CLEANet在受污染多元时间序列异常检测中表现出优异的鲁棒性和效率，其污染弹性训练框架具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) anomaly detection is essential for maintaining
the reliability of industrial systems, yet real-world deployment is hindered by
two critical challenges: training data contamination (noises and hidden
anomalies) and inefficient model inference. Existing unsupervised methods
assume clean training data, but contamination distorts learned patterns and
degrades detection accuracy. Meanwhile, complex deep models often overfit to
contamination and suffer from high latency, limiting practical use. To address
these challenges, we propose CLEANet, a robust and efficient anomaly detection
framework in contaminated multivariate time series. CLEANet introduces a
Contamination-Resilient Training Framework (CRTF) that mitigates the impact of
corrupted samples through an adaptive reconstruction weighting strategy
combined with clustering-guided contrastive learning, thereby enhancing
robustness. To further avoid overfitting on contaminated data and improve
computational efficiency, we design a lightweight conjugate MLP that
disentangles temporal and cross-feature dependencies. Across five public
datasets, CLEANet achieves up to 73.04% higher F1 and 81.28% lower runtime
compared with ten state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, integrating CRTF
into three advanced models yields an average 5.35% F1 gain, confirming its
strong generalizability.

Conclusion: FastVLM在保持完整模型性能完整性的同时，实现了效率与准确性的平衡，显著加速了视觉语言模型的推理过程。

Abstract: Vision-language Models (VLMs) have made significant strides in visual
understanding and query response generation, but often face challenges of high
computational cost and inference latency due to autoregressive decoding. In
this work, we introduce an imitation-learning-based Self-Speculative Decoding
(SSD) framework, named FastVLM, to address these limitations. Our approach
employs a lightweight draft model for token generation in an autoregressive
manner, while a full model verifies these tokens non-autoregressively. Accepted
tokens proceed seamlessly, while rejected tokens are corrected by the full
model and used to guide the draft model's refinement. Through an imitation
network, FastVLM enhances the draft model by integrating deeper level insights
from the full model's architecture. Also, it maintains the performance
integrity of the full model while training the draft model, achieving a balance
between efficiency and accuracy. Our method speeds up the inference process by
1.55-1.85x as compared to the final layer with minimal loss in performance.

Conclusion: 池化操作在图神经网络的对抗鲁棒性中扮演重要角色，RS-Pool方法通过利用主奇异向量有效提升了图分类任务的鲁棒性，为图神经网络的安全应用提供了新的防御思路。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved strong performance across a range
of graph representation learning tasks, yet their adversarial robustness in
graph classification remains underexplored compared to node classification.
While most existing defenses focus on the message-passing component, this work
investigates the overlooked role of pooling operations in shaping robustness.
We present a theoretical analysis of standard flat pooling methods (sum,
average and max), deriving upper bounds on their adversarial risk and
identifying their vulnerabilities under different attack scenarios and graph
structures. Motivated by these insights, we propose \textit{Robust Singular
Pooling (RS-Pool)}, a novel pooling strategy that leverages the dominant
singular vector of the node embedding matrix to construct a robust graph-level
representation. We theoretically investigate the robustness of RS-Pool and
interpret the resulting bound leading to improved understanding of our proposed
pooling operator. While our analysis centers on Graph Convolutional Networks
(GCNs), RS-Pool is model-agnostic and can be implemented efficiently via power
iteration. Empirical results on real-world benchmarks show that RS-Pool
provides better robustness than the considered pooling methods when subject to
state-of-the-art adversarial attacks while maintaining competitive clean
accuracy. Our code is publicly available

Abstract: Density estimation is essential for generative modeling, particularly with
the rise of modern neural networks. While existing methods capture complex data
distributions, they often lack interpretability and uncertainty quantification.
Bayesian nonparametric methods, especially the \polya tree, offer a robust
framework that addresses these issues by accurately capturing function behavior
over small intervals. Traditional techniques like Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) face high computational complexity and scalability limitations,
hindering the use of Bayesian nonparametric methods in deep learning. To tackle
this, we introduce the variational \polya tree (VPT) model, which employs
stochastic variational inference to compute posterior distributions. This model
provides a flexible, nonparametric Bayesian prior that captures latent
densities and works well with stochastic gradient optimization. We also
leverage the joint distribution likelihood for a more precise variational
posterior approximation than traditional mean-field methods. We evaluate the
model performance on both real data and images, and demonstrate its
competitiveness with other state-of-the-art deep density estimation methods. We
also explore its ability in enhancing interpretability and uncertainty
quantification. Code is available at

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
a spectrum of graph-related tasks, however concerns persist regarding their
vulnerability to adversarial perturbations. While prevailing defense strategies
focus primarily on pre-processing techniques and adaptive message-passing
schemes, this study delves into an under-explored dimension: the impact of
weight initialization and associated hyper-parameters, such as training epochs,
on a model's robustness. We introduce a theoretical framework bridging the
connection between initialization strategies and a network's resilience to
adversarial perturbations. Our analysis reveals a direct relationship between
initial weights, number of training epochs and the model's vulnerability,
offering new insights into adversarial robustness beyond conventional defense
mechanisms. While our primary focus is on GNNs, we extend our theoretical
framework, providing a general upper-bound applicable to Deep Neural Networks.
Extensive experiments, spanning diverse models and real-world datasets
subjected to various adversarial attacks, validate our findings. We illustrate
that selecting appropriate initialization not only ensures performance on clean
datasets but also enhances model robustness against adversarial perturbations,
with observed gaps of up to 50\% compared to alternative initialization
approaches.

Method: 提出M-LCB元算法，使用UCB风格的置信区间构建，直接从实现损失构建，无需额外优化

Result: M-LCB确保整体遗憾界为Õ(√(KT/M) + (K/M)¹⁻ᵃTᵃ)，其中每个专家内部遗憾为Õ(Tᵃ)

Conclusion: 这是首个在每轮预算约束下同时训练多个自适应专家的遗憾保证结果，扩展了经典bandit范式

Abstract: In many modern applications, a system must dynamically choose between several
adaptive learning algorithms that are trained online. Examples include model
selection in streaming environments, switching between trading strategies in
finance, and orchestrating multiple contextual bandit or reinforcement learning
agents. At each round, a learner must select one predictor among $K$ adaptive
experts to make a prediction, while being able to update at most $M \le K$ of
them under a fixed training budget.
  We address this problem in the \emph{stochastic setting} and introduce
\algname{M-LCB}, a computationally efficient UCB-style meta-algorithm that
provides \emph{anytime regret guarantees}. Its confidence intervals are built
directly from realized losses, require no additional optimization, and
seamlessly reflect the convergence properties of the underlying experts. If
each expert achieves internal regret $\tilde O(T^\alpha)$, then \algname{M-LCB}
ensures overall regret bounded by $\tilde O\!\Bigl(\sqrt{\tfrac{KT}{M}} \;+\;
(K/M)^{1-\alpha}\,T^\alpha\Bigr)$.
  To our knowledge, this is the first result establishing regret guarantees
when multiple adaptive experts are trained simultaneously under per-round
budget constraints. We illustrate the framework with two representative cases:
(i) parametric models trained online with stochastic losses, and (ii) experts
that are themselves multi-armed bandit algorithms. These examples highlight how
\algname{M-LCB} extends the classical bandit paradigm to the more realistic
scenario of coordinating stateful, self-learning experts under limited
resources.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
learning representations without labeled data. Most SSL approaches rely on
strong, well-established, handcrafted data augmentations to generate diverse
views for representation learning. However, designing such augmentations
requires domain-specific knowledge and implicitly imposes representational
invariances on the model, which can limit generalization. In this work, we
propose an unsupervised representation learning method that replaces
augmentations by generating views using orthonormal bases and overcomplete
frames. We show that embeddings learned from orthonormal and overcomplete
spaces reside on distinct manifolds, shaped by the geometric biases introduced
by representing samples in different spaces. By jointly leveraging the
complementary geometry of these distinct manifolds, our approach achieves
superior performance without artificially increasing data diversity through
strong augmentations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on nine
datasets across five temporal sequence tasks, where signal-specific
characteristics make data augmentations particularly challenging. Without
relying on augmentation-induced diversity, our method achieves performance
gains of up to 15--20\% over existing self-supervised approaches. Source code:

Conclusion: 受流匹配在生成建模中成功的启发，提出了价值估计的生成范式FlowCritic

Abstract: Reliable value estimation serves as the cornerstone of reinforcement learning
(RL) by evaluating long-term returns and guiding policy improvement,
significantly influencing the convergence speed and final performance. Existing
works improve the reliability of value function estimation via multi-critic
ensembles and distributional RL, yet the former merely combines multi point
estimation without capturing distributional information, whereas the latter
relies on discretization or quantile regression, limiting the expressiveness of
complex value distributions. Inspired by flow matching's success in generative
modeling, we propose a generative paradigm for value estimation, named
FlowCritic. Departing from conventional regression for deterministic value
prediction, FlowCritic leverages flow matching to model value distributions and
generate samples for value estimation.

Abstract: Recovering causal structure in the presence of latent variables is an
important but challenging task. While many methods have been proposed to handle
it, most of them require strict and/or untestable assumptions on the causal
structure. In real-world scenarios, observed variables may be affected by
multiple latent variables simultaneously, which, generally speaking, cannot be
handled by these methods. In this paper, we consider the linear, non-Gaussian
case, and make use of the joint higher-order cumulant matrix of the observed
variables constructed in a specific way. We show that, surprisingly, causal
asymmetry between two observed variables can be directly seen from the rank
deficiency properties of such higher-order cumulant matrices, even in the
presence of an arbitrary number of latent confounders. Identifiability results
are established, and the corresponding identification methods do not even
involve iterative procedures. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness and asymptotic correctness of our proposed method.

Abstract: Faithful reasoning in medical vision-language models (VLMs) requires not only
accurate predictions but also transparent alignment between textual rationales
and visual evidence. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has shown promise
in medical visual question answering (VQA), no large-scale expert-level dataset
has captured stepwise reasoning with precise visual grounding. We introduce
S-Chain, the first large-scale dataset of 12,000 expert-annotated medical
images with bounding boxes and structured visual CoT (SV-CoT), explicitly
linking visual regions to reasoning steps. The dataset further supports 16
languages, totaling over 700k VQA pairs for broad multilingual applicability.
Using S-Chain, we benchmark state-of-the-art medical VLMs (ExGra-Med,
LLaVA-Med) and general-purpose VLMs (Qwen2.5-VL, InternVL2.5), showing that
SV-CoT supervision significantly improves interpretability, grounding fidelity,
and robustness. Beyond benchmarking, we study its synergy with
retrieval-augmented generation, revealing how domain knowledge and visual
grounding interact during autoregressive reasoning. Finally, we propose a new
mechanism that strengthens the alignment between visual evidence and reasoning,
improving both reliability and efficiency. S-Chain establishes a new benchmark
for grounded medical reasoning and paves the way toward more trustworthy and
explainable medical VLMs.

TL;DR: ATLAS是一个基于认知地图和前瞻模拟的网页智能体，无需微调就能适应新环境，在WebArena-Lite基准测试中达到63%的成功率，优于之前53.9%的SOTA方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的网页智能体无法有效适应新环境，缺乏对环境结构和动态的认知，导致执行计划效率低下。

Method: ATLAS通过轻量级好奇心驱动探索构建认知地图，包含规划器提出候选动作、模拟器在认知空间预测后果、评论家选择最佳执行路径、浏览器执行器执行动作的模块化架构。

Result: 在WebArena-Lite基准测试中达到63%的成功率，相比之前最好的53.9%有显著提升，且无需网站特定的LLM微调。

Conclusion: 消融实验表明世界模型、分层规划器和基于前瞻的重新规划器在系统设计中具有互补作用，模块化架构有效解决了环境适应问题。

Abstract: We observe that current state-of-the-art web-agents are unable to effectively
adapt to new environments without neural network fine-tuning, without which
they produce inefficient execution plans due to a lack of awareness of the
structure and dynamics of the new environment. To address this limitation, we
introduce ATLAS (Actor-Critic Task-completion with Look-ahead Action
Simulation), a memory-augmented agent that is able to make plans grounded in a
model of the environment by simulating the consequences of those actions in
cognitive space. Our agent starts by building a "cognitive map" by performing a
lightweight curiosity driven exploration of the environment. The planner
proposes candidate actions; the simulator predicts their consequences in
cognitive space; a critic analyzes the options to select the best roll-out and
update the original plan; and a browser executor performs the chosen action. On
the WebArena-Lite Benchmark, we achieve a 63% success rate compared to 53.9%
success rate for the previously published state-of-the-art. Unlike previous
systems, our modular architecture requires no website-specific LLM fine-tuning.
Ablations show sizable drops without the world-model, hierarchical planner, and
look-ahead-based replanner confirming their complementary roles within the
design of our system

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出Centrum，一种基于梯度提升集成和保形推理的新型DBMS自动调优器，解决了传统GP-BO和树集成BO在数据库性能调优中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现传统GP-BO在DBMS自动调优中存在基本假设被广泛违反的问题，而现有树集成BO虽然避免了这些假设陷阱，但仍存在不确定性估计的分布假设限制。

Method: Centrum采用两阶段随机梯度提升集成学习改进代理模型中的分布无关点估计和区间估计，并结合广义SGBE估计的局部自适应保形预测实现分布无关的不确定性估计和获取函数。

Result: 在两个DBMS和三个工作负载上的大量物理和仿真实验表明，Centrum优于21种最先进的方法。

Conclusion: Centrum是首个实现分布无关性的自动调优器，显著提升了BO在DBMS自动调优中的实用性，并首次无缝融合了梯度提升集成和保形推理。

Abstract: Gaussian-Process-based Bayesian optimization (GP-BO), is a prevailing
model-based framework for DBMS auto-tuning. However, recent work shows
GP-BO-based DBMS auto-tuners significantly outperformed auto-tuners based on
SMAC, which features random forest surrogate models; such results motivate us
to rethink and investigate the limitations of GP-BO in auto-tuner design. We
find the fundamental assumptions of GP-BO are widely violated when modeling and
optimizing DBMS performance, while tree-ensemble-BOs (e.g., SMAC) can avoid the
assumption pitfalls and deliver improved tuning efficiency and effectiveness.
Moreover, we argue that existing tree-ensemble-BOs restrict further advancement
in DBMS auto-tuning. First, existing tree-ensemble-BOs can only achieve
distribution-free point estimates, but still impose unrealistic distributional
assumptions on uncertainty estimates, compromising surrogate modeling and
distort the acquisition function. Second, recent advances in gradient boosting,
which can further enhance surrogate modeling against vanilla GP and random
forest counterparts, have rarely been applied in optimizing DBMS auto-tuners.
To address these issues, we propose a novel model-based DBMS auto-tuner,
Centrum. Centrum improves distribution-free point and interval estimation in
surrogate modeling with a two-phase learning procedure of stochastic gradient
boosting ensembles. Moreover, Centrum adopts a generalized SGBE-estimated
locally-adaptive conformal prediction to facilitate a distribution-free
uncertainty estimation and acquisition function. To our knowledge, Centrum is
the first auto-tuner to realize distribution-freeness, enhancing BO's
practicality in DBMS auto-tuning, and the first to seamlessly fuse gradient
boosting ensembles and conformal inference in BO. Extensive physical and
simulation experiments on two DBMSs and three workloads show Centrum
outperforms 21 SOTA methods.

### [529] [Distributionally Robust Optimization via Diffusion Ambiguity Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22757)
*Jiaqi Wen,Jianyi Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了基于扩散模型的分布鲁棒优化（D-DRO）方法，通过扩散模型构建模糊集来捕获超出名义分布支持空间的对抗分布，并开发了可求解的内层最大化算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DRO的模糊集需要既能保持与名义分布的一致性，又能覆盖各种潜在场景，同时保证优化问题的可解性。现有方法在捕获超出名义支持空间的分布方面存在局限。

Method: 提出扩散模型构建的模糊集设计，能够捕获超出名义支持空间的对抗分布；在此基础上开发D-DRO算法，在参数化扩散模型空间内求解内层最大化问题。

Result: 理论证明了D-DRO的平稳收敛性能，并在机器学习预测任务中实证展示了其优越的分布外泛化性能。

Conclusion: 基于扩散模型的DRO框架能够有效提升模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力，特别是在处理超出训练分布的数据时表现优异。

Abstract: This paper studies Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO), a fundamental
framework for enhancing the robustness and generalization of statistical
learning and optimization. An effective ambiguity set for DRO must involve
distributions that remain consistent with the nominal distribution while being
diverse enough to account for a variety of potential scenarios. Moreover, it
should lead to tractable DRO solutions. To this end, we propose a
diffusion-based ambiguity set design that captures various adversarial
distributions beyond the nominal support space while maintaining consistency
with the nominal distribution. Building on this ambiguity modeling, we propose
Diffusion-based DRO (D-DRO), a tractable DRO algorithm that solves the inner
maximization over the parameterized diffusion model space. We formally
establish the stationary convergence performance of D-DRO and empirically
demonstrate its superior Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization performance
in a ML prediction task.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TALE是一种推理时算法，通过直接优化任务特定验证性能来修剪整个Transformer层，无需重新训练即可提高准确性并降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要重新训练，且无法在保持准确性的同时有效减少计算成本。TALE旨在通过选择性移除层来解决某些层作为瓶颈的问题，提升任务相关表示。

Method: TALE在推理时直接优化任务特定验证性能来修剪整个Transformer层，无需重新训练，并在微调过程中应用以获得额外性能提升。

Result: 在9个任务和5个模型上的评估显示，TALE在零样本和少样本设置下均能一致提高准确性并减少计算成本，同时提供准确性与效率之间的灵活权衡控制。

Conclusion: TALE通过选择性层移除解决了某些层作为瓶颈的问题，产生了更小、更快、更准确的模型，同时为Transformer可解释性提供了新的见解。

Abstract: In this paper we introduce Tale, Task-Aware Layer Elimination, an
inference-time algorithm that prunes entire transformer layers in an LLM by
directly optimizing task-specific validation performance. We evaluate TALE on 9
tasks and 5 models, including LLaMA 3.1 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B, Qwen 2.5 0.5B, Mistral
7B, and Lucie 7B, under both zero-shot and few-shot settings. Unlike prior
approaches, TALE requires no retraining and consistently improves accuracy
while reducing computational cost across all benchmarks. Furthermore, applying
TALE during finetuning leads to additional performance gains. Finally, TALE
provides flexible user control over trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency.
Mutual information analysis shows that certain layers act as bottlenecks,
degrading task-relevant representations. Tale's selective layer removal
remedies this problem, producing smaller, faster, and more accurate models that
are also faster to fine-tune while offering new insights into transformer
interpretability.

*Wenrui Cai,Defa Zhu,Qingjie Liu,Qiyang Min*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了SeeDNorm，一种动态调整缩放系数的归一化方法，通过保留输入范数信息和实现数据依赖的自重缩放，在保持RMSNorm优点的同时提升模型表示能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RMSNorm丢弃了输入范数信息，且静态缩放因子无法适应输入数据的广泛变化和分布偏移，特别是在大语言模型的零样本场景中限制了性能提升。

Method: SeeDNorm基于当前输入动态调整缩放系数，保留输入范数信息，实现数据依赖的动态归一化。在反向传播中保持RMSNorm根据输入范数动态调整梯度的能力，并解决了潜在的不稳定性问题。

Result: 在不同规模的大语言模型预训练以及监督和无监督计算机视觉任务中，SeeDNorm以最少的参数引入和对模型效率的极小影响，持续优于RMSNorm、LayerNorm和DyT等归一化方法。

Conclusion: SeeDNorm通过动态缩放机制有效提升了模型的表示能力，在各种任务中表现出优越性能，是归一化层的有力替代方案。

Abstract: Normalization layer constitutes an essential component in neural networks. In
transformers, the predominantly used RMSNorm constrains vectors to a unit
hypersphere, followed by dimension-wise rescaling through a learnable scaling
coefficient $\gamma$ to maintain the representational capacity of the model.
However, RMSNorm discards the input norm information in forward pass and a
static scaling factor $\gamma$ may be insufficient to accommodate the wide
variability of input data and distributional shifts, thereby limiting further
performance improvements, particularly in zero-shot scenarios that large
language models routinely encounter. To address this limitation, we propose
SeeDNorm, which enhances the representational capability of the model by
dynamically adjusting the scaling coefficient based on the current input,
thereby preserving the input norm information and enabling data-dependent,
self-rescaled dynamic normalization. During backpropagation, SeeDNorm retains
the ability of RMSNorm to dynamically adjust gradient according to the input
norm. We provide a detailed analysis of the training optimization for SeedNorm
and proposed corresponding solutions to address potential instability issues
that may arise when applying SeeDNorm. We validate the effectiveness of
SeeDNorm across models of varying sizes in large language model pre-training as
well as supervised and unsupervised computer vision tasks. By introducing a
minimal number of parameters and with neglligible impact on model efficiency,
SeeDNorm achieves consistently superior performance compared to previously
commonly used normalization layers such as RMSNorm and LayerNorm, as well as
element-wise activation alternatives to normalization layers like DyT.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NBF-Rec是一种基于图的推荐模型，支持在不相交用户和物品集合的数据集间进行归纳式迁移学习，无需为每个领域重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于图的推荐系统通常在转导式设置下训练，限制了其对新用户、新物品或新数据集的适用性。

Method: NBF-Rec在推理时动态计算节点嵌入，使用交互级消息传递，支持零样本设置和轻量级微调。

Result: 在七个真实世界数据集上的评估显示，NBF-Rec在零样本设置下达到竞争性性能，并通过轻量级微调进一步改进。

Conclusion: 基于图的推荐中的归纳式迁移是可行的，交互级消息传递支持跨数据集泛化，无需对齐的用户或物品。

Abstract: Graph-based recommender systems are commonly trained in transductive
settings, which limits their applicability to new users, items, or datasets. We
propose NBF-Rec, a graph-based recommendation model that supports inductive
transfer learning across datasets with disjoint user and item sets. Unlike
conventional embedding-based methods that require retraining for each domain,
NBF-Rec computes node embeddings dynamically at inference time. We evaluate the
method on seven real-world datasets spanning movies, music, e-commerce, and
location check-ins. NBF-Rec achieves competitive performance in zero-shot
settings, where no target domain data is used for training, and demonstrates
further improvements through lightweight fine-tuning. These results show that
inductive transfer is feasible in graph-based recommendation and that
interaction-level message passing supports generalization across datasets
without requiring aligned users or items.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于信息论不确定性的无模型机器学习框架，通过惊奇值直接分析原始数据，无需分布建模，减少偏差，支持数据直接编辑和删除，在多种任务中达到或接近最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习依赖显式模型和领域假设，限制了灵活性和可解释性。需要一种能够直接分析原始数据、减少偏差、支持高效更新的统一框架。

Method: 使用惊奇值（信息论不确定性）作为核心度量，通过量化不确定性来评估相关性，实现无分布建模，支持数据直接编辑和删除操作。

Result: 在生成推理、因果发现、异常检测和时间序列预测等任务中达到或接近最先进性能，能够有效处理复杂数据类型包括缺失数据。

Conclusion: 该方法为可扩展机器学习和人工智能提供了可行的神经网络替代方案，能够保持底层机制的人类可理解性，创建了信息的"物理学"基础。

Abstract: Traditional machine learning relies on explicit models and domain
assumptions, limiting flexibility and interpretability. We introduce a
model-free framework using surprisal (information theoretic uncertainty) to
directly analyze and perform inferences from raw data, eliminating distribution
modeling, reducing bias, and enabling efficient updates including direct edits
and deletion of training data. By quantifying relevance through uncertainty,
the approach enables generalizable inference across tasks including generative
inference, causal discovery, anomaly detection, and time series forecasting. It
emphasizes traceability, interpretability, and data-driven decision making,
offering a unified, human-understandable framework for machine learning, and
achieves at or near state-of-the-art performance across most common machine
learning tasks. The mathematical foundations create a ``physics'' of
information, which enable these techniques to apply effectively to a wide
variety of complex data types, including missing data. Empirical results
indicate that this may be a viable alternative path to neural networks with
regard to scalable machine learning and artificial intelligence that can
maintain human understandability of the underlying mechanics.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于异构奖励分布式多智能体多臂老虎机问题的完全分布式算法，在随机通信图上实现了对数级遗憾上界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在随机时变通信图上，具有异构奖励的多智能体多臂老虎机问题，其中每个智能体对同一臂的奖励分布可能不同，且通信图不一定连通。

Method: 结合臂消除策略和随机gossip算法，提出完全分布式算法，利用Erdős-Rényi模型生成随机通信图。

Result: 理论证明遗憾上界为O(log T)，包含集中式最优遗憾和反映通信效率影响的额外项，该额外项与代数连通性和链路概率相关。

Conclusion: 算法在随机通信图上实现了高效性能，揭示了通信效率与遗憾之间的基本权衡关系，数值实验验证了理论结果。

Abstract: We study the distributed multi-agent multi-armed bandit problem with
heterogeneous rewards over random communication graphs. Uniquely, at each time
step $t$ agents communicate over a time-varying random graph $G_t$ generated by
applying the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model to a fixed connected base graph $G$ (for
classical Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs, $G$ is a complete graph), where each
potential edge in $G$ is randomly and independently present with the link
probability $p$. Notably, the resulting random graph is not necessarily
connected at each time step. Each agent's arm rewards follow time-invariant
distributions, and the reward distribution for the same arm may differ across
agents. The goal is to minimize the cumulative expected regret relative to the
global mean reward of each arm, defined as the average of that arm's mean
rewards across all agents. To this end, we propose a fully distributed
algorithm that integrates the arm elimination strategy with the random gossip
algorithm. We theoretically show that the regret upper bound is of order $\log
T$ and is highly interpretable, where $T$ is the time horizon. It includes the
optimal centralized regret $O\left(\sum_{k: \Delta_k>0} \frac{\log
T}{\Delta_k}\right)$ and an additional term $O\left(\frac{N^2 \log T}{p
\lambda_{N-1}(Lap(G))} + \frac{KN^2 \log T}{p}\right)$ where $N$ and $K$ denote
the total number of agents and arms, respectively. This term reflects the
impact of $G$'s algebraic connectivity $\lambda_{N-1}(Lap(G))$ and the link
probability $p$, and thus highlights a fundamental trade-off between
communication efficiency and regret. As a by-product, we show a nearly optimal
regret lower bound. Finally, our numerical experiments not only show the
superiority of our algorithm over existing benchmarks, but also validate the
theoretical regret scaling with problem complexity.

*Soham Pahari,Sandeep Chand Kumain*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合LOESS分解、ARIMA建模和多尺度CNN-BiLSTM网络的混合预测框架，用于准确预测印度大城市的空气质量指数，在PM2.5、O3、CO和NOx等污染物预测上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 印度大城市空气污染严重，污染物水平突然飙升给及时干预带来挑战。AQI预测困难在于同时存在线性趋势、季节性变化和波动非线性模式。

Method: 使用LOESS将AQI序列分解为趋势、季节性和残差分量，ARIMA建模平滑分量，提出的深度学习模块（多尺度CNN-BiLSTM网络+残差门控注意力机制）捕捉残差中的多尺度波动性，使用UAMMO优化器调优超参数。

Result: 在2021-2023年中央污染控制委员会数据集上的实验表明，该方法在三个主要城市的所有污染物预测中均优于统计、深度学习和混合基线方法，MSE降低5-8%，R²得分>0.94。

Conclusion: 该框架具有鲁棒性，对突发污染事件敏感，适用于城市空气质量管理的实际应用。

Abstract: Air pollution remains a critical environmental and public health concern in
Indian megacities such as Delhi, Kolkata, and Mumbai, where sudden spikes in
pollutant levels challenge timely intervention. Accurate Air Quality Index
(AQI) forecasting is difficult due to the coexistence of linear trends,
seasonal variations, and volatile nonlinear patterns. This paper proposes a
hybrid forecasting framework that integrates LOESS decomposition, ARIMA
modeling, and a multi-scale CNN-BiLSTM network with a residual-gated attention
mechanism. The LOESS step separates the AQI series into trend, seasonal, and
residual components, with ARIMA modeling the smooth components and the proposed
deep learning module capturing multi-scale volatility in the residuals. Model
hyperparameters are tuned via the Unified Adaptive Multi-Stage Metaheuristic
Optimizer (UAMMO), combining multiple optimization strategies for efficient
convergence. Experiments on 2021-2023 AQI datasets from the Central Pollution
Control Board show that the proposed method consistently outperforms
statistical, deep learning, and hybrid baselines across PM2.5, O3, CO, and NOx
in three major cities, achieving up to 5-8% lower MSE and higher R^2 scores
(>0.94) for all pollutants. These results demonstrate the framework's
robustness, sensitivity to sudden pollution events, and applicability to urban
air quality management.

TL;DR: 本文分析了BOBW FTRL算法在赌博机问题中的末次迭代收敛速率，证明了使用Ψ(p)=-4∑√pᵢ正则函数的1/2-Tsallis-INF算法的Bregman散度以t^{-1/2}速率衰减。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线学习算法的末次迭代收敛分析对机器学习理论很重要，但在多臂赌博机问题中，现有分析主要关注遗憾阶数，而对末次迭代收敛速率的研究较少，特别是对广泛研究的FTRL算法。

Method: 使用与BOBW FTRL算法1/2-Tsallis-INF相关的正则函数Ψ(p)=-4∑√pᵢ，分析Bregman散度在最优臂点质量与迭代t时臂集概率分布之间的衰减速率。

Result: 理论分析表明，Bregman散度以t^{-1/2}的速率衰减，部分证实了对数遗憾对应t^{-1}末次迭代收敛速率的直觉。

Conclusion: 本文通过理论分析部分证实了对数遗憾与t^{-1}末次迭代收敛速率相关的直觉，为FTRL算法在赌博机问题中的末次迭代收敛分析提供了理论基础。

Abstract: The convergence analysis of online learning algorithms is central to machine
learning theory, where last-iterate convergence is particularly important, as
it captures the learner's actual decisions and describes the evolution of the
learning process over time. However, in multi-armed bandits, most existing
algorithmic analyses mainly focus on the order of regret, while the
last-iterate (simple regret) convergence rate remains less explored --
especially for the widely studied Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL)
algorithms. Recently, a growing line of work has established the
Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW) property of FTRL algorithms in bandit problems,
showing in particular that they achieve logarithmic regret in stochastic
bandits. Nevertheless, their last-iterate convergence rate has not yet been
studied. Intuitively, logarithmic regret should correspond to a $t^{-1}$
last-iterate convergence rate. This paper partially confirms this intuition
through theoretical analysis, showing that the Bregman divergence, defined by
the regular function $\Psi(p)=-4\sum_{i=1}^{d}\sqrt{p_i}$ associated with the
BOBW FTRL algorithm $1/2$-Tsallis-INF (arXiv:1807.07623), between the point
mass on the optimal arm and the probability distribution over the arm set
obtained at iteration $t$, decays at a rate of $t^{-1/2}$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将GAN的不可区分性与逻辑解释相结合，通过有界逻辑深度来约束生成过程，使生成样本具有可验证的逻辑属性。

Method: 使用深度k的Ehrenfeucht-Fraïssé博弈框架，判别器作为Opponent寻找逻辑错误，生成器作为Builder生成能通过k轮匹配验证的样本。提供EF探针模拟器和MSO风格图检查器。

Result: 框架验证显示92%-98%的属性满足率，真实神经GAN训练在挑战性属性上提升5%-14%，连通性达到98%满足率。

Conclusion: LOGAN提供了紧凑、可复现的逻辑有界生成路径，具有可解释的失败、经过验证的有效性（模拟和真实训练）和可控参数。

Abstract: GANs promise indistinguishability, logic explains it. We put the two on a
budget: a discriminator that can only ``see'' up to a logical depth $k$, and a
generator that must look correct to that bounded observer. \textbf{LOGAN}
(LOGical GANs) casts the discriminator as a depth-$k$ Ehrenfeucht--Fra\"iss\'e
(EF) \emph{Opponent} that searches for small, legible faults (odd cycles,
nonplanar crossings, directed bridges), while the generator plays
\emph{Builder}, producing samples that admit a $k$-round matching to a target
theory $T$. We ship a minimal toolkit -- an EF-probe simulator and MSO-style
graph checkers -- and four experiments including real neural GAN training with
PyTorch. Beyond verification, we score samples with a \emph{logical loss} that
mixes budgeted EF round-resilience with cheap certificate terms, enabling a
practical curriculum on depth. Framework validation demonstrates $92\%$--$98\%$
property satisfaction via simulation (Exp.~3), while real neural GAN training
achieves $5\%$--$14\%$ improvements on challenging properties and $98\%$
satisfaction on connectivity (matching simulation) through adversarial learning
(Exp.~4). LOGAN is a compact, reproducible path toward logic-bounded generation
with interpretable failures, proven effectiveness (both simulated and real
training), and dials for control.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于单细胞RNA测序数据的潜在即插即用扩散框架，通过分离观测空间和去噪空间来提高聚类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单细胞RNA测序数据由于测量噪声和生物变异性，在标准潜在空间中不同细胞类型的数据可能投影得很接近，导致准确聚类困难。

Method: 采用新颖的Gibbs采样程序，在低维潜在空间应用学习的扩散先验进行去噪，同时在原始高维观测空间重新引入噪声来引导该过程，确保去噪轨迹忠实于原始数据结构。

Result: 在合成数据和真实单细胞基因组数据上评估了鲁棒性。在合成数据上提高了不同噪声水平和数据集偏移下的聚类准确性；在真实数据上显示出更好的生物学一致性，聚类边界更符合已知细胞类型标记和发育轨迹。

Conclusion: 该方法通过输入空间引导实现了自适应噪声处理、不确定性量化和可泛化去噪，显著提升了单细胞数据的聚类质量和生物学解释性。

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables the study of cellular
heterogeneity. Yet, clustering accuracy, and with it downstream analyses based
on cell labels, remain challenging due to measurement noise and biological
variability. In standard latent spaces (e.g., obtained through PCA), data from
different cell types can be projected close together, making accurate
clustering difficult. We introduce a latent plug-and-play diffusion framework
that separates the observation and denoising space. This separation is
operationalized through a novel Gibbs sampling procedure: the learned diffusion
prior is applied in a low-dimensional latent space to perform denoising, while
to steer this process, noise is reintroduced into the original high-dimensional
observation space. This unique "input-space steering" ensures the denoising
trajectory remains faithful to the original data structure. Our approach offers
three key advantages: (1) adaptive noise handling via a tunable balance between
prior and observed data; (2) uncertainty quantification through principled
uncertainty estimates for downstream analysis; and (3) generalizable denoising
by leveraging clean reference data to denoise noisier datasets, and via
averaging, improve quality beyond the training set. We evaluate robustness on
both synthetic and real single-cell genomics data. Our method improves
clustering accuracy on synthetic data across varied noise levels and dataset
shifts. On real-world single-cell data, our method demonstrates improved
biological coherence in the resulting cell clusters, with cluster boundaries
that better align with known cell type markers and developmental trajectories.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于物理信息神经网络(PINN)的框架，用于建模和预测随机FitzHugh-Nagumo神经元中的自诱导随机共振(SISR)现象，无需外部周期性驱动或接近分岔点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自诱导随机共振(SISR)是慢-快可激发系统中仅由噪声驱动产生的相干振荡现象，传统方法需要大量计算资源进行随机模拟。本研究旨在开发一种数据高效且可解释的替代模型。

Method: 将控制随机微分方程和SISR渐近时间尺度匹配约束直接嵌入到基于噪声增强状态预测器架构的物理信息神经网络中，复合损失函数整合了数据保真度、动力学残差和基于Kramers逃逸理论的物理约束。

Result: 训练后的PINN能够准确预测尖峰序列相干性对噪声强度、兴奋性和时间尺度分离的依赖性，与直接随机模拟结果匹配，相比纯数据驱动方法在精度和泛化能力上有显著提升，同时计算需求大幅减少。

Conclusion: 该框架为模拟和分析多尺度随机系统中的噪声诱导相干性提供了一种数据高效且可解释的替代模型。

Abstract: Self-induced stochastic resonance (SISR) is the emergence of coherent
oscillations in slow-fast excitable systems driven solely by noise, without
external periodic forcing or proximity to a bifurcation. This work presents a
physics-informed machine learning framework for modeling and predicting SISR in
the stochastic FitzHugh-Nagumo neuron. We embed the governing stochastic
differential equations and SISR-asymptotic timescale-matching constraints
directly into a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) based on a
Noise-Augmented State Predictor architecture. The composite loss integrates
data fidelity, dynamical residuals, and barrier-based physical constraints
derived from Kramers' escape theory. The trained PINN accurately predicts the
dependence of spike-train coherence on noise intensity, excitability, and
timescale separation, matching results from direct stochastic simulations with
substantial improvements in accuracy and generalization compared with purely
data-driven methods, while requiring significantly less computation. The
framework provides a data-efficient and interpretable surrogate model for
simulating and analyzing noise-induced coherence in multiscale stochastic
systems.

Conclusion: E2D2框架通过专门的编码器-解码器架构、训练和采样算法，显著提升了离散扩散模型的推理效率。

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models enable parallel token sampling for faster inference
than autoregressive approaches. However, prior diffusion models use a
decoder-only architecture, which requires sampling algorithms that invoke the
full network at every denoising step and incur high computational cost. Our key
insight is that discrete diffusion models perform two types of computation: 1)
representing clean tokens and 2) denoising corrupted tokens, which enables us
to use separate modules for each task. We propose an encoder-decoder
architecture to accelerate discrete diffusion inference, which relies on an
encoder to represent clean tokens and a lightweight decoder to iteratively
refine a noised sequence. We also show that this architecture enables faster
training of block diffusion models, which partition sequences into blocks for
better quality and are commonly used in diffusion language model inference. We
introduce a framework for Efficient Encoder-Decoder Diffusion (E2D2),
consisting of an architecture with specialized training and sampling
algorithms, and we show that E2D2 achieves superior trade-offs between
generation quality and inference throughput on summarization, translation, and
mathematical reasoning tasks. We provide the code, model weights, and blog post

Abstract: Precipitation prediction has undergone a profound transformation -- from
early symbolic and empirical methods rooted in divination and observation, to
modern technologies based on atmospheric physics and artificial intelligence.
This review traces the historical and technological evolution of precipitation
forecasting, presenting a survey about end-to-end precipitation prediction
technologies that spans ancient practices, the foundations of meteorological
science, the rise of numerical weather prediction (NWP), and the emergence of
machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models. We first explore
traditional and indigenous forecasting methods, then describe the development
of physical modeling and statistical frameworks that underpin contemporary
operational forecasting. Particular emphasis is placed on recent advances in
neural network-based approaches, including automated deep learning,
interpretability-driven design, and hybrid physical-data models. By compositing
research across multiple eras and paradigms, this review not only depicts the
history of end-to-end precipitation prediction but also outlines future
directions in next generation forecasting systems.

TL;DR: RLPD-GX是一个混合离线-在线强化学习框架，通过将策略优化与安全执行解耦来解决分布偏移问题。奖励寻求的学习器自由探索，而基于投影的守护者保证规则一致执行和安全值备份，实现了探索与安全的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合离线-在线强化学习结合了样本效率和鲁棒探索的优势，但面临离线与在线数据分布偏移导致的不稳定性问题。需要一种方法既能保持在线交互的探索价值，又不会退化为保守策略。

Method: 提出RLPD-GX框架，将策略优化与安全执行解耦：奖励寻求的学习器自由探索，基于投影的守护者保证规则一致执行和安全值备份。还提出动态课程学习，逐步扩展时间视野并退火离线-在线数据混合。

Result: 在Atari-100k上达到归一化平均得分3.02，比现有混合方法提升45%，具有更强的安全性和稳定性。在安全关键和长视野任务上均表现一致提升。

Conclusion: 解耦的安全执行为鲁棒的混合离线-在线强化学习提供了一条简单而原则性的路径，为在强化学习中调和探索与安全提出了更广泛的范式。

Abstract: Hybrid offline--online reinforcement learning (O2O RL) promises both sample
efficiency and robust exploration, but suffers from instability due to
distribution shift between offline and online data. We introduce RLPD-GX, a
framework that decouples policy optimization from safety enforcement: a
reward-seeking learner explores freely, while a projection-based guardian
guarantees rule-consistent execution and safe value backups. This design
preserves the exploratory value of online interactions without collapsing to
conservative policies. To further stabilize training, we propose dynamic
curricula that gradually extend temporal horizons and anneal offline--online
data mixing. We prove convergence via a contraction property of the guarded
Bellman operator, and empirically show state-of-the-art performance on
Atari-100k, achieving a normalized mean score of 3.02 (+45\% over prior hybrid
methods) with stronger safety and stability. Beyond Atari, ablations
demonstrate consistent gains across safety-critical and long-horizon tasks,
underscoring the generality of our design. Extensive and comprehensive results
highlight decoupled safety enforcement as a simple yet principled route to
robust O2O RL, suggesting a broader paradigm for reconciling exploration and
safety in reinforcement learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在48小时后预测稳定性不足，特别是在监测网络稀疏的城市中，无法满足公共卫生预警系统对长期可靠预测的需求

Method: 结合动态时间规整进行智能站点相似性选择，使用轻量级CNN-GRU架构增强气象特征，为稀疏网络优化的可扩展设计

Result: 在8个监测站多年小时数据验证中表现优于现有深度学习方法，24小时预测R2=0.91，首次实现10天稳定预测（240小时R2=0.73）

Conclusion: 该框架计算效率高且不依赖外部工具，特别适合资源受限的城市环境部署，解决了早期预警系统的关键需求

Abstract: Reliable long-term forecasting of PM2.5 concentrations is critical for public
health early-warning systems, yet existing deep learning approaches struggle to
maintain prediction stability beyond 48 hours, especially in cities with sparse
monitoring networks. This paper presents a deep learning framework that
combines Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) for intelligent station similarity
selection with a CNN-GRU architecture to enable extended-horizon PM2.5
forecasting in Isfahan, Iran, a city characterized by complex pollution
dynamics and limited monitoring coverage. Unlike existing approaches that rely
on computationally intensive transformer models or external simulation tools,
our method integrates three key innovations: (i) DTW-based historical sampling
to identify similar pollution patterns across peer stations, (ii) a lightweight
CNN-GRU architecture augmented with meteorological features, and (iii) a
scalable design optimized for sparse networks. Experimental validation using
multi-year hourly data from eight monitoring stations demonstrates superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art deep learning methods, achieving R2 =
0.91 for 24-hour forecasts. Notably, this is the first study to demonstrate
stable 10-day PM2.5 forecasting (R2 = 0.73 at 240 hours) without performance
degradation, addressing critical early-warning system requirements. The
framework's computational efficiency and independence from external tools make
it particularly suitable for deployment in resource-constrained urban
environments.

TL;DR: 该研究测试了基础模型在医疗数据上的表现，发现虽然能生成看似真实的特征分布，但无法保持临床相关的跨特征结构，揭示了生成式预训练在医疗领域的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来一些研究将基础模型的表示直接用于表型发现而缺乏严格验证，存在生成表面真实但临床不连贯嵌入的风险。本研究旨在测试这种不匹配问题。

Method: 在HIV抗逆转录病毒治疗和急性低血压数据集上训练了两个自回归模型（序列到序列LSTM和简化Transformer），训练时添加受控的不规则性（随机访问间隔），测试序列保持完整，通过患者轨迹合成评估分布和相关性保真度。

Result: 两个模型都能复现特征分布，但都未能保持跨特征结构，表明生成式预训练能产生局部真实性但临床连贯性有限。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了领域特定评估的必要性，并支持将轨迹合成作为微调或部署前的实用探针。

Abstract: Foundation models refer to architectures trained on vast datasets using
autoregressive pre-training from natural language processing to capture
intricate patterns and motifs. They were originally developed to transfer such
learned knowledge to downstream predictive tasks. Recently, however, some
studies repurpose these learned representations for phenotype discovery without
rigorous validation, risking superficially realistic but clinically incoherent
embeddings. To test this mismatch, we trained two autoregressive models -- a
sequence-to-sequence LSTM and a reduced Transformer -- on longitudinal ART for
HIV and Acute Hypotension datasets. Controlled irregularity was added during
training via random inter-visit gaps, while test sequences stayed complete.
Patient-trajectory synthesis evaluated distributional and correlational
fidelity. Both reproduced feature distributions but failed to preserve
cross-feature structure -- showing that generative pre-training yields local
realism but limited clinical coherence. These results highlight the need for
domain-specific evaluation and support trajectory synthesis as a practical
probe before fine-tuning or deployment.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的联邦学习框架，通过可学习的客户端嵌入控制来解决多模态联邦学习中数据不完整和异构问题，实现局部自适应表示对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的多模态联邦学习面临客户端数据不完整和异构问题，导致局部特征表示不对齐，限制了模型聚合的效果。现有方法假设要么模态集不同但输入特征完整，要么共享模态集但存在缺失特征，而本文考虑更一般和现实的设置：每个客户端观察不同的模态子集，且每个模态内也可能有缺失特征。

Method: 提出基于可学习客户端嵌入控制的联邦学习框架，这些嵌入编码客户端的数据缺失模式，作为重构信号来对齐全局聚合表示与局部上下文。嵌入控制可以在具有相似数据缺失模式的客户端间进行算法聚合，增强重构信号的鲁棒性。

Result: 在多个联邦多模态基准测试中，该方法在严重数据不完整情况下实现了高达36.45%的性能提升，并通过理论分析提供了明确的性能界限。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法通过客户端嵌入控制有效解决了多模态联邦学习中的数据不完整和异构问题，实现了局部自适应表示对齐，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Multimodal federated learning in real-world settings often encounters
incomplete and heterogeneous data across clients. This results in misaligned
local feature representations that limit the effectiveness of model
aggregation. Unlike prior work that assumes either differing modality sets
without missing input features or a shared modality set with missing features
across clients, we consider a more general and realistic setting where each
client observes a different subset of modalities and might also have missing
input features within each modality. To address the resulting misalignment in
learned representations, we propose a new federated learning framework
featuring locally adaptive representations based on learnable client-side
embedding controls that encode each client's data-missing patterns.
  These embeddings serve as reconfiguration signals that align the globally
aggregated representation with each client's local context, enabling more
effective use of shared information. Furthermore, the embedding controls can be
algorithmically aggregated across clients with similar data-missing patterns to
enhance the robustness of reconfiguration signals in adapting the global
representation. Empirical results on multiple federated multimodal benchmarks
with diverse data-missing patterns across clients demonstrate the efficacy of
the proposed method, achieving up to 36.45\% performance improvement under
severe data incompleteness. The method is also supported by a theoretical
analysis with an explicit performance bound that matches our empirical
observations. Our source codes are provided at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准的人类偏好对齐方法如RLHF复杂且不稳定，需要更简单有效的替代方案。

Method: 基于最大边际似然估计的偏好优化方法MMPO，最大化偏好文本输出的边际对数似然，使用偏好对作为近似样本。

Result: 在1.35亿到80亿参数模型上，MMPO对超参数β更稳定，在保持基础模型通用语言能力的同时实现竞争性或更优的偏好对齐效果。

Conclusion: MMPO通过梯度更新中的隐式偏好优化实现了改进的性能，为LLM对齐提供了更简单稳定的替代方案。

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences is crucial, but
standard methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) are
often complex and unstable. In this work, we propose a new, simpler approach
that recasts alignment through the lens of Maximum Marginal Likelihood (MML)
estimation. Our new MML based Preference Optimization (MMPO) maximizes the
marginal log-likelihood of a preferred text output, using the preference pair
as samples for approximation, and forgoes the need for both an explicit reward
model and entropy maximization. We theoretically demonstrate that MMPO
implicitly performs preference optimization, producing a weighted gradient that
naturally up-weights chosen responses over rejected ones. Across models ranging
from 135M to 8B parameters, we empirically show that MMPO: 1) is more stable
with respect to the hyperparameter $\beta$ compared to alternative baselines,
and 2) achieves competitive or superior preference alignment while better
preserving the base model's general language capabilities. Through a series of
ablation experiments, we show that this improved performance is indeed
attributable to MMPO's implicit preference optimization within the gradient
updates.

Abstract: Linguistic Landscape (LL) research traditionally relies on manual photography
and annotation of public signages to examine distribution of languages in urban
space. While such methods yield valuable findings, the process is
time-consuming and difficult for large study areas. This study explores the use
of AI powered language detection method to automate LL analysis. Using Honolulu
Chinatown as a case study, we constructed a georeferenced photo dataset of
1,449 images collected by researchers and applied AI for optical character
recognition (OCR) and language classification. We also conducted manual
validations for accuracy checking. This model achieved an overall accuracy of
79%. Five recurring types of mislabeling were identified, including distortion,
reflection, degraded surface, graffiti, and hallucination. The analysis also
reveals that the AI model treats all regions of an image equally, detecting
peripheral or background texts that human interpreters typically ignore.
Despite these limitations, the results demonstrate the potential of integrating
AI-assisted workflows into LL research to reduce such time-consuming processes.
However, due to all the limitations and mis-labels, we recognize that AI cannot
be fully trusted during this process. This paper encourages a hybrid approach
combining AI automation with human validation for a more reliable and efficient
workflow.

Abstract: Natural disasters, such as volcanic eruptions, pose significant challenges to
daily life and incur considerable global economic losses. The emergence of
next-generation small-satellites, capable of constellation-based operations,
offers unparalleled opportunities for near-real-time monitoring and onboard
processing of such events. However, a major bottleneck remains the lack of
extensive annotated datasets capturing volcanic activity, which hinders the
development of robust detection systems. This paper introduces a novel dataset
explicitly designed for volcanic activity and eruption detection, encompassing
diverse volcanoes worldwide. The dataset provides binary annotations to
identify volcanic anomalies or non-anomalies, covering phenomena such as
temperature anomalies, eruptions, and volcanic ash emissions. These annotations
offer a foundational resource for developing and evaluating detection models,
addressing a critical gap in volcanic monitoring research. Additionally, we
present comprehensive benchmarks using state-of-the-art models to establish
baselines for future studies. Furthermore, we explore the potential for
deploying these models onboard next-generation satellites. Using the Intel
Movidius Myriad X VPU as a testbed, we demonstrate the feasibility of volcanic
activity detection directly onboard. This capability significantly reduces
latency and enhances response times, paving the way for advanced early warning
systems. This paves the way for innovative solutions in volcanic disaster
management, encouraging further exploration and refinement of onboard
monitoring technologies.

Abstract: Subgraph matching is vital in knowledge graph (KG) question answering,
molecule design, scene graph, code and circuit search, etc. Neural methods have
shown promising results for subgraph matching. Our study of recent systems
suggests refactoring them into a unified design space for graph matching
networks. Existing methods occupy only a few isolated patches in this space,
which remains largely uncharted. We undertake the first comprehensive
exploration of this space, featuring such axes as attention-based vs. soft
permutation-based interaction between query and corpus graphs, aligning nodes
vs. edges, and the form of the final scoring network that integrates neural
representations of the graphs. Our extensive experiments reveal that judicious
and hitherto-unexplored combinations of choices in this space lead to large
performance benefits. Beyond better performance, our study uncovers valuable
insights and establishes general design principles for neural graph
representation and interaction, which may be of wider interest.

Abstract: We investigate the role of network architecture in shaping the inductive

Score Anisotropy Directions (SADs), architecture-dependent directions that
reveal how different networks preferentially capture data structure. Our
analysis shows that SADs form adaptive bases aligned with the architecture's

behavior and correlate with downstream performance, as measured by Wasserstein
metrics. Our work offers a new lens for explaining and predicting directional
biases of generative models.

Result: 在四个不同维度的数据集上，SSBA方法在L2范数距离上比现有方法减少5%-50%。在运行时间方面，相比基于网格的方法，SSBA能够在相同时间内生成多个数量级的决策边界点。

Conclusion: SSBA提供了一种简单有效的模型无关方法，能够计算最近且可行的反事实解释，适用于处理现实世界约束条件的高维空间问题。

Abstract: In our article, we describe a method for generating counterfactual
explanations in high-dimensional spaces using four steps that involve fitting
our dataset to a model, finding the decision boundary, determining constraints
on the problem, and computing the closest point (counterfactual explanation)
from that boundary. We propose a discretized approach where we find many
discrete points on the boundary and then identify the closest feasible
counterfactual explanation. This method, which we later call $\textit{Segmented
Sampling for Boundary Approximation}$ (SSBA), applies binary search to find
decision boundary points and then searches for the closest boundary point.
Across four datasets of varying dimensionality, we show that our method can
outperform current methods for counterfactual generation with reductions in
distance between $5\%$ to $50\%$ in terms of the $L_2$ norm. Our method can
also handle real-world constraints by restricting changes to immutable and
categorical features, such as age, gender, sex, height, and other related
characteristics such as the case for a health-based dataset. In terms of
runtime, the SSBA algorithm generates decision boundary points on multiple
orders of magnitude in the same given time when we compare to a grid-based
approach. In general, our method provides a simple and effective model-agnostic
method that can compute nearest feasible (i.e. realistic with constraints)
counterfactual explanations. All of our results and our code can be found here

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently been extended to language generation through
Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs), which achieve performance competitive
with strong autoregressive models. However, MDLMs tend to degrade in the
few-step regime and cannot directly adopt existing few-step distillation
methods designed for continuous diffusion models, as they lack the intrinsic
property of mapping from noise to data. Recent Uniform-state Diffusion Models
(USDMs), initialized from a uniform prior, alleviate some limitations but still
suffer from complex loss formulations that hinder scalability. In this work, we
propose a simplified denoising-based loss for USDMs that optimizes only
noise-replaced tokens, stabilizing training and matching ELBO-level
performance. Furthermore, by framing denoising as self-supervised learning, we
introduce a simple modification to our denoising loss with contrastive-inspired
negative gradients, which is practical and yield additional improvements in
generation quality.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in complex, high-dimensional data, such as UAV sensor
readings, is essential for operational safety but challenging for existing
methods due to their limited sensitivity, scalability, and inability to capture
intricate dependencies. We propose the Diffuse to Detect (DTD) framework, a
novel approach that innovatively adapts diffusion models for anomaly detection,
diverging from their conventional use in generative tasks with high inference
time. By comparison, DTD employs a single-step diffusion process to predict
noise patterns, enabling rapid and precise identification of anomalies without
reconstruction errors. This approach is grounded in robust theoretical
foundations that link noise prediction to the data distribution's score
function, ensuring reliable deviation detection. By integrating Graph Neural
Networks to model sensor relationships as dynamic graphs, DTD effectively
captures spatial (inter-sensor) and temporal anomalies. Its two-branch
architecture, with parametric neural network-based energy scoring for
scalability and nonparametric statistical methods for interpretability,
provides flexible trade-offs between computational efficiency and transparency.
Extensive evaluations on UAV sensor data, multivariate time series, and images
demonstrate DTD's superior performance over existing methods, underscoring its
generality across diverse data modalities. This versatility, combined with its
adaptability, positions DTD as a transformative solution for safety-critical
applications, including industrial monitoring and beyond.

*Xiaofan Zhou,Lu Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应拒绝和非交换共形预测框架，用于解决持续领域预训练中LLMs的统计可靠性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习对LLMs适应知识增长至关重要，但缺乏统计可靠性保证，特别是在持续领域预训练场景中，传统共形预测面临分布偏移和预测集过大的挑战。

Method: 使用基于transformer的聚类估计测试集中问题的领域分布，重新加权或重采样校准数据，结合自适应拒绝机制让LLM在置信度显著变化时选择弃答。

Result: 大量实验表明该框架在持续领域预训练场景中显著提高了共形预测的有效性和可靠性。

Conclusion: 该自适应拒绝和非交换共形预测框架成功解决了持续领域预训练中LLMs的统计可靠性问题，提供了有效的正确性保证。

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) is essential for enabling self-evolving large
language models (LLMs) to adapt and remain effective amid rapid knowledge
growth. Yet, despite its importance, little attention has been given to
establishing statistical reliability guarantees for LLMs under CL, particularly
in the setting of continual domain pretraining (CDP). Conformal Prediction (CP)
has shown promise in offering correctness guarantees for LLMs, but it faces
major challenges in CDP: testing data often stems from unknown or shifting
domain distributions, under which CP may no longer provide valid guarantees.
Moreover, when high coverage is required, CP can yield excessively large
prediction sets for unanswerable queries, reducing informativeness. To address
these challenges, we introduce an adaptive rejection and non-exchangeable CP
framework. Our method first estimates the distribution of questions across
domains in the test set using transformer-based clustering, then reweights or
resamples the calibration data accordingly. Building on this, adaptive
rejection CP allows the LLM to selectively abstain from answering when its
confidence or competence shifts significantly. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework enhances both the effectiveness and reliability
of CP under CDP scenarios. Our code is available at:

*Judah Goldfeder,Matthew So,Hod Lipson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的方法来动态生成辅助任务，避免了传统元学习方法中的双层优化问题，并在CIFAR100数据集上取得了优于人工标注辅助任务的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 辅助学习需要人工标注辅助任务标签，这需要大量人力和领域专业知识。现有的元学习方法使用双层优化，计算成本高且代码复杂。

Method: 使用强化学习框架，RL代理为训练集中的每个数据点选择辅助标签，当选择能提升主任务性能时获得奖励。还实验了学习每个数据点的辅助损失权重策略。

Result: 在20-Superclass CIFAR100问题上，RL方法优于人工标注的辅助任务，与主流双层优化技术表现相当。权重学习方法显著优于所有基准，VGG16架构达到80.9%测试准确率（人工标注为75.53%）。

Conclusion: 证明了RL是动态生成辅助任务的可行方法，并且可以同时学习辅助任务标签和每个样本的辅助任务权重，取得优异结果。

Abstract: Auxiliary Learning (AL) is a special case of Multi-task Learning (MTL) in
which a network trains on auxiliary tasks to improve performance on its main
task. This technique is used to improve generalization and, ultimately,
performance on the network's main task. AL has been demonstrated to improve
performance across multiple domains, including navigation, image
classification, and natural language processing. One weakness of AL is the need
for labeled auxiliary tasks, which can require human effort and domain
expertise to generate. Meta Learning techniques have been used to solve this
issue by learning an additional auxiliary task generation network that can
create helpful tasks for the primary network. The most prominent techniques
rely on Bi-Level Optimization, which incurs computational cost and increased
code complexity. To avoid the need for Bi-Level Optimization, we present an
RL-based approach to dynamically create auxiliary tasks. In this framework, an
RL agent is tasked with selecting auxiliary labels for every data point in a
training set. The agent is rewarded when their selection improves the
performance on the primary task. We also experiment with learning optimal
strategies for weighing the auxiliary loss per data point. On the 20-Superclass
CIFAR100 problem, our RL approach outperforms human-labeled auxiliary tasks and
performs as well as a prominent Bi-Level Optimization technique. Our weight
learning approaches significantly outperform all of these benchmarks. For
example, a Weight-Aware RL-based approach helps the VGG16 architecture achieve
80.9% test accuracy while the human-labeled auxiliary task setup achieved
75.53%. The goal of this work is to (1) prove that RL is a viable approach to
dynamically generate auxiliary tasks and (2) demonstrate that per-sample
auxiliary task weights can be learned alongside the auxiliary task labels and
can achieve strong results.

*Zhenglai Shen,Hongyu Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种灾害响应数字孪生系统，结合物理信息神经网络、多模态数据融合和公平感知风险分析，用于城市级灾害响应。在模拟的野火-停电-热浪连锁灾害中，该系统能维持稳定的室内温度预测，并通过强化学习自适应调整数据输入权重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复合气候灾害（如野火引发的停电和城市热浪）对城市稳定性和公平性构成挑战，需要开发能够整合物理建模和社会公平考虑的城市响应系统。

Method: 使用物理信息神经网络建模、多模态数据融合（IoT、无人机、卫星数据）和公平感知风险分析，构建灾害响应数字孪生系统。采用强化学习自适应重新加权不同数据源输入。

Result: 在模拟测试中，系统在部分传感器丢失情况下仍能维持稳定的室内温度预测（约31-33°C）。通过前瞻性干预措施（如预防性冷却中心激活和微电网共享），人口加权热风险降低11-13%，尾部风险降低7-17%，过热时间减少达9%。

Conclusion: H-RDT框架为实际城市实施建立了可转移的基础，将物理灾害建模与社会公平和决策智能联系起来，推动数字城市韧性向自适应、基于学习和以公平为中心的决策支持发展。

Abstract: Compounding climate hazards, such as wildfire-induced outages and urban
heatwaves, challenge the stability and equity of cities. We present a
Hazard-Responsive Digital Twin (H-RDT) that combines physics-informed neural
network modeling, multimodal data fusion, and equity-aware risk analytics for
urban-scale response. In a synthetic district with diverse building archetypes
and populations, a simulated wildfire-outage-heatwave cascade shows that H-RDT
maintains stable indoor temperature predictions (approximately 31 to 33 C)
under partial sensor loss, reproducing outage-driven surges and recovery. The
reinforcement learning based fusion module adaptively reweights IoT, UAV, and
satellite inputs to sustain spatiotemporal coverage, while the equity-adjusted
mapping isolates high-vulnerability clusters (schools, clinics, low-income
housing). Prospective interventions, such as preemptive cooling-center
activation and microgrid sharing, reduce population-weighted thermal risk by 11
to 13 percent, shrink the 95th-percentile (tail) risk by 7 to 17 percent, and
cut overheating hours by up to 9 percent. Beyond the synthetic demonstration,
the framework establishes a transferable foundation for real-city
implementation, linking physical hazard modeling with social equity and
decision intelligence. The H-RDT advances digital urban resilience toward
adaptive, learning-based, and equity-centered decision support for climate
adaptation.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通过汉克尔奇异值正则化来压缩状态空间模型的方法，使模型在保持高精度的同时实现高达10倍的压缩比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于状态空间模型的深度神经网络在长序列任务中表现良好，但训练后压缩困难。为了解决这个问题，研究者希望通过正则化汉克尔奇异值来获得可压缩的模型。

Method: 开发了一种高效计算汉克尔奇异值的算法，利用状态空间模型参数化中系统矩阵的块对角结构，在训练迭代中实现汉克尔奇异值的正则化。

Result: 在Long Range Arena基准测试上的实验表明，正则化后的状态空间层比标准状态空间层压缩率高10倍，同时保持了高精度。

Conclusion: 汉克尔奇异值正则化是一种有效的状态空间模型压缩方法，能够在保持性能的同时显著提高模型的可压缩性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks using state space models as layers are well suited for
long-range sequence tasks but can be challenging to compress after training. We
use that regularizing the sum of Hankel singular values of state space models
leads to a fast decay of these singular values and thus to compressible models.
To make the proposed Hankel singular value regularization scalable, we develop
an algorithm to efficiently compute the Hankel singular values during training
iterations by exploiting the specific block-diagonal structure of the system
matrices that is we use in our state space model parametrization. Experiments
on Long Range Arena benchmarks demonstrate that the regularized state space
layers are up to 10$\times$ more compressible than standard state space layers
while maintaining high accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出了Manifold approximated Kernel Alignment (MKA)方法，将流形几何融入核对齐任务，相比传统的CKA方法更加稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的中心核对齐(CKA)方法不考虑底层流形结构，依赖大量启发式方法，在不同数据规模下表现不一致。

Method: 提出了MKA方法，将流形几何融入核对齐任务，并建立了理论框架。在合成数据集和真实世界示例上进行了实证评估。

Result: 研究发现流形感知的核对齐为表示度量提供了更稳健的基础。

Conclusion: MKA方法在表示学习等领域具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Centered kernel alignment (CKA) is a popular metric for comparing
representations, determining equivalence of networks, and neuroscience
research. However, CKA does not account for the underlying manifold and relies
on numerous heuristics that cause it to behave differently at different scales
of data. In this work, we propose Manifold approximated Kernel Alignment (MKA),
which incorporates manifold geometry into the alignment task. We derive a
theoretical framework for MKA. We perform empirical evaluations on synthetic
datasets and real-world examples to characterize and compare MKA to its
contemporaries. Our findings suggest that manifold-aware kernel alignment
provides a more robust foundation for measuring representations, with potential
applications in representation learning.

TL;DR: 语言模型在上下文组合任务中表现不佳，简单的任务示例反而可能产生负面影响，因为模型难以正确识别和组装技能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型在上下文示例中组合基本技能以完成复合任务的能力，这比标准设置更具挑战性。

Method: 对多个开源语言模型进行系统实验，使用语言和逻辑任务来探测组合能力，并进行理论分析。

Result: 实验结果显示简单任务示例对性能有负面影响，模型难以正确识别和组装技能，即使使用思维链示例也是如此。

Conclusion: 示例与组合步骤的对齐至关重要，这启发了一种改进的探测任务方法，其性能提升为我们的见解提供了积极支持。

Abstract: Composing basic skills from simple tasks to accomplish composite tasks is
crucial for modern intelligent systems. We investigate the in-context
composition ability of language models to perform composite tasks that combine
basic skills demonstrated in in-context examples. This is more challenging than
the standard setting, where skills and their composition can be learned in
training. We conduct systematic experiments on various representative
open-source language models, utilizing linguistic and logical tasks designed to
probe composition abilities. The results reveal that simple task examples can
have a surprising negative impact on the performance, because the models
generally struggle to recognize and assemble the skills correctly, even with
Chain-of-Thought examples. Theoretical analysis further shows that it is
crucial to align examples with the corresponding steps in the composition. This
inspires a method for the probing tasks, whose improved performance provides
positive support for our insights.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SARNet是一个用于预测剩余使用寿命(RUL)的尖峰感知连续验证框架，结合现代时间卷积网络和物理信息可解释性，在故障起始阶段表现更稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有RUL预测模型在故障起始阶段的脆弱性、对尖峰信号处理不佳以及缺乏物理解释性的问题。

Method: 基于ModernTCN预测退化敏感指标，采用自适应连续阈值验证真实尖峰并抑制噪声，对故障易发段进行针对性特征工程，最后使用堆叠RF-LGBM回归器生成RUL。

Result: 在基准数据集上，相比现有基线方法显著降低误差(RMSE 0.0365, MAE 0.0204)，同时保持轻量级、鲁棒且易于部署。

Conclusion: SARNet框架在RUL预测中实现了更高的准确性和可解释性，为系统可靠性提升和维护风险降低提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of remaining useful life (RUL) is essential to enhance
system reliability and reduce maintenance risk. Yet many strong contemporary
models are fragile around fault onset and opaque to engineers: short,
high-energy spikes are smoothed away or misread, fixed thresholds blunt
sensitivity, and physics-based explanations are scarce. To remedy this, we
introduce SARNet (Spike-Aware Consecutive Validation Framework), which builds
on a Modern Temporal Convolutional Network (ModernTCN) and adds spike-aware
detection to provide physics-informed interpretability. ModernTCN forecasts
degradation-sensitive indicators; an adaptive consecutive threshold validates
true spikes while suppressing noise. Failure-prone segments then receive
targeted feature engineering (spectral slopes, statistical derivatives, energy
ratios), and the final RUL is produced by a stacked RF--LGBM regressor. Across
benchmark-ported datasets under an event-triggered protocol, SARNet
consistently lowers error compared to recent baselines (RMSE 0.0365, MAE
0.0204) while remaining lightweight, robust, and easy to deploy.

### [561] [The Reasoning Trap: How Enhancing LLM Reasoning Amplifies Tool Hallucination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22977)
*Chenlong Yin,Zeyang Sha,Shiwen Cui,Changhua Meng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 增强LLM推理能力会系统性增加工具幻觉，这是一个因果关系而非过拟合，且与训练方法无关。缓解策略会带来可靠性-能力权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究发现更强的推理能力往往伴随更多幻觉，但缺乏对推理增强是否直接导致工具幻觉的系统性研究。

Method: 构建SimpleToolHalluBench基准，在两种失败模式下测量工具幻觉：无可用工具和仅有干扰工具。通过控制实验研究推理增强与工具幻觉的因果关系。

Result: 1. 推理增强与工具幻觉存在因果关系；2. 该效应超越过拟合；3. 方法无关性；4. 缓解策略存在可靠性-能力权衡；5. 机制上推理RL会压缩工具可靠性相关表示。

Conclusion: 当前推理增强方法固有地放大工具幻觉，需要开发同时优化能力和可靠性的新训练目标。

Abstract: Enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a key
strategy for building Agents that "think then act." However, recent
observations, like OpenAI's o3, suggest a paradox: stronger reasoning often
coincides with increased hallucination, yet no prior work has systematically
examined whether reasoning enhancement itself causes tool hallucination. To
address this gap, we pose the central question: Does strengthening reasoning
increase tool hallucination? To answer this, we introduce SimpleToolHalluBench,
a diagnostic benchmark measuring tool hallucination in two failure modes: (i)
no tool available, and (ii) only distractor tools available. Through controlled
experiments, we establish three key findings. First, we demonstrate a causal
relationship: progressively enhancing reasoning through RL increases tool
hallucination proportionally with task performance gains. Second, this effect
transcends overfitting - training on non-tool tasks (e.g., mathematics) still
amplifies subsequent tool hallucination. Third, the effect is method-agnostic,
appearing when reasoning is instilled via supervised fine-tuning and when it is
merely elicited at inference by switching from direct answers to step-by-step
thinking. We also evaluate mitigation strategies including Prompt Engineering
and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), revealing a fundamental
reliability-capability trade-off: reducing hallucination consistently degrades
utility. Mechanistically, Reasoning RL disproportionately collapses
tool-reliability-related representations, and hallucinations surface as
amplified divergences concentrated in late-layer residual streams. These
findings reveal that current reasoning enhancement methods inherently amplify
tool hallucination, highlighting the need for new training objectives that
jointly optimize for capability and reliability.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了谱梯度下降(SpecGD)等矩阵值优化器在深度学习中的泛化特性，发现它们在处理不平衡数据时能更均衡地学习数据的所有主成分，从而在早期训练阶段获得更好的平衡准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着Muon和Shampoo等谱感知矩阵值优化器在深度学习中的广泛应用，需要系统研究它们的泛化特性，特别是确定它们在什么情况下能超越竞争算法。

Method: 使用不平衡数据作为测试平台，研究谱梯度下降(SpecGD)的规范形式，并在高斯混合数据模型和线性/双线性模型中量化SpecGD何时优于普通欧几里得梯度下降。

Result: 研究发现，与GD优先学习数据的主要主成分不同，SpecGD以相同的速率学习数据的所有主成分，这导致SpecGD在早期训练阶段具有更好的平衡准确率，且这种差距在使用自适应步长时仍然存在。

Conclusion: 谱优化器通过促进数据基础组件的更均衡学习，实现了优越的泛化性能，这一发现在深度线性模型中得到了放大，并在各种不平衡数据集上得到了实证验证。

Abstract: The growing adoption of spectrum-aware matrix-valued optimizers such as Muon
and Shampoo in deep learning motivates a systematic study of their
generalization properties and, in particular, when they might outperform
competitive algorithms. We approach this question by introducing appropriate
simplifying abstractions as follows: First, we use imbalanced data as a
testbed. Second, we study the canonical form of such optimizers, which is
Spectral Gradient Descent (SpecGD) -- each update step is $UV^T$ where $U\Sigma
V^T$ is the truncated SVD of the gradient. Third, within this framework we
identify a canonical setting for which we precisely quantify when SpecGD
outperforms vanilla Euclidean GD. For a Gaussian mixture data model and both
linear and bilinear models, we show that unlike GD, which prioritizes learning
dominant principal components of the data first, SpecGD learns all principal
components of the data at equal rates. We demonstrate how this translates to a
growing gap in balanced accuracy favoring SpecGD early in training and further
show that the gap remains consistent even when the GD counterpart uses adaptive
step-sizes via normalization. By extending the analysis to deep linear models,
we show that depth amplifies these effects. We empirically verify our
theoretical findings on a variety of imbalanced datasets. Our experiments
compare practical variants of spectral methods, like Muon and Shampoo, against
their Euclidean counterparts and Adam. The results validate our findings that
these spectral optimizers achieve superior generalization by promoting a more
balanced learning of the data's underlying components.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have substantially improved
the training of large-scale language models, leading to significant gains in
generation quality and reasoning ability. However, most existing research
focuses on dense models, while RL training for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architectures remains underexplored. To address the instability commonly
observed in MoE training, we propose a novel router-aware approach to optimize
importance sampling (IS) weights in off-policy RL. Specifically, we design a
rescaling strategy guided by router logits, which effectively reduces gradient
variance and mitigates training divergence. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method significantly improves both the convergence stability and the
final performance of MoE models, highlighting the potential of RL algorithmic
innovations tailored to MoE architectures and providing a promising direction
for efficient training of large-scale expert models.

<details>

Motivation: 网络服务数量激增导致相似服务选择困难，现有QoS预测方法难以捕捉丰富上下文信息且在数据稀疏和结构噪声下性能不佳

Method: 集成多阶注意力机制聚合上下文数据，使用对抗神经网络进行自回归监督学习，采用Gumbel-Softmax离散采样技术生成负样本

Result: 在大规模真实数据集上的实验验证表明，该模型显著优于现有基线方法

Conclusion: QoSMGAA在服务选择和推荐场景中具有强大的实际部署潜力

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of internet technologies, network services have
become critical for delivering diverse and reliable applications to users.
However, the exponential growth in the number of available services has
resulted in many similar offerings, posing significant challenges in selecting
optimal services. Predicting Quality of Service (QoS) accurately thus becomes a
fundamental prerequisite for ensuring reliability and user satisfaction.
However, existing QoS prediction methods often fail to capture rich contextual
information and exhibit poor performance under extreme data sparsity and
structural noise. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel architecture, QoSMGAA,
specifically designed to enhance prediction accuracy in complex and noisy
network service environments. QoSMGAA integrates a multi-order attention
mechanism to aggregate extensive contextual data and predict missing QoS values
effectively. Additionally, our method incorporates adversarial neural networks
to perform autoregressive supervised learning based on transformed interaction
matrices. To capture complex, higher-order interactions among users and
services, we employ a discrete sampling technique leveraging the Gumbel-Softmax
method to generate informative negative samples. Comprehensive experimental
validation conducted on large-scale real-world datasets demonstrates that our
proposed model significantly outperforms existing baseline methods,
highlighting its strong potential for practical deployment in service selection
and recommendation scenarios.

Motivation: 为GSPO算法的重要性权重提供信息论解释，帮助理解其经验特性如方差减少和训练稳定性。

Method: 通过数学推导建立GSPO序列级权重与困惑度比率、交叉熵变化之间的等价关系，并在数学推理任务上进行验证实验。

Result: 证明了GSPO的序列级权重可以等价表示为困惑度比率和指数交叉熵变化，验证了方差预测的准确性。

Conclusion: 信息论视角为理解GSPO算法提供了新的洞察，解释了其几何平均带来的对数域方差减少和混合专家模型训练稳定性。

Abstract: We provide a new perspective on GSPO's length-normalized importance ratios by
establishing their connection to information-theoretic quantities. We show that
GSPO's sequence-level weight $s(\theta) =
(\pi_\theta/\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}})^{1/|y|}$ can be equivalently expressed
as the inverse perplexity ratio
$\text{PPL}_{\theta_{\text{old}}}/\text{PPL}_\theta$ and as the exponential
cross-entropy change $\exp(\Delta H)$. While the perplexity-entropy
relationship follows from standard definitions, this observation provides a
useful lens for understanding GSPO: the algorithm weights policy gradient
updates by perplexity ratios, offering an information-theoretic interpretation
of the importance weights. This perspective helps explain GSPO's empirical
properties, including log-domain variance reduction through geometric averaging
and stability in training mixture-of-experts models. We validate the
mathematical equivalences and variance predictions through controlled
experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks.

Motivation: 现有等变模型大多局限于简单对称性（如旋转），无法处理科学领域中常见的更广泛的一般线性变换GL(n)。

Method: 引入伴随不变双线性层，实现对李代数特征和矩阵值输入的稳定等变性，无需为每个子群重新设计。

Conclusion: ReLNs为在李代数和矩阵值数据上学习广泛线性群对称性提供了实用且通用的框架。

Abstract: Encoding symmetries is a powerful inductive bias for improving the
generalization of deep neural networks. However, most existing equivariant
models are limited to simple symmetries like rotations, failing to address the
broader class of general linear transformations, GL(n), that appear in many
scientific domains. We introduce Reductive Lie Neurons (ReLNs), a novel neural
network architecture exactly equivariant to these general linear symmetries.
ReLNs are designed to operate directly on a wide range of structured inputs,
including general n-by-n matrices. ReLNs introduce a novel adjoint-invariant
bilinear layer to achieve stable equivariance for both Lie-algebraic features
and matrix-valued inputs, without requiring redesign for each subgroup. This
architecture overcomes the limitations of prior equivariant networks that only
apply to compact groups or simple vector data. We validate ReLNs' versatility
across a spectrum of tasks: they outperform existing methods on algebraic
benchmarks with sl(3) and sp(4) symmetries and achieve competitive results on a
Lorentz-equivariant particle physics task. In 3D drone state estimation with
geometric uncertainty, ReLNs jointly process velocities and covariances,
yielding significant improvements in trajectory accuracy. ReLNs provide a
practical and general framework for learning with broad linear group symmetries
on Lie algebras and matrix-valued data. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的持续预训练缩放定律通常假设固定的预训练预算，这限制了它们预测在不同tokens-per-parameter(PTPP)下训练的模型适应结果的能力。

Method: 提出PTPP感知的适应缩放定律，将预训练预算作为显式变量，通过早期阶段(PTPP={15,31})的训练来预测目标损失在PTPP=279时的表现。

Result: 在多语言设置(英语/阿拉伯语→法语)中，PTPP感知方法在未见PTPP值上的预测优于PTPP不可知的DCPT传输基线，在多个指标上表现更好。

Conclusion: PTPP感知缩放定律不仅能准确预测适应损失，还能在实际应用中规划回放比率和适应token预算，在计算限制下满足目标和遗忘约束。

Abstract: Continual pre-training (CPT) for domain adaptation must balance target-domain
gains with stability on the base domain. Existing CPT scaling laws typically
assume a fixed pre-training budget, which limits their ability to forecast
adaptation outcomes for models trained at different tokens-per-parameter
(PTPP). We present \emph{PTPP-aware} adaptation scaling laws that make the
pre-training budget an explicit variable, enabling accurate \emph{prediction}
of adaptation loss at unseen \ptpp. On a multilingual setup (English/Arabic
$\rightarrow$ French), PTPP-aware formulations trained on early stages
(\ptpp{}=\{15,31\}) predict target loss at \ptpp{}=279 and outperform a
PTPP-agnostic \dcpt{} transfer baseline on metrics (Huber-on-log,

ratios and adaptation token budgets that satisfy target and forgetting
constraints under compute limits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机森林和XGBoost使用等权重聚合CART树，限制了模型性能的进一步提升

Method: 结合OP2T框架为不同输入动态分配不等权重，并使用混合整数优化动态优化权重

Result: 在20多个真实数据集上的二分类和多分类任务中，AF始终优于RF、XGBoost和其他加权RF方法

Conclusion: AF通过自适应权重选择机制显著提升了集成学习模型的性能

Abstract: Random Forests (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) are two of the
most widely used and highly performing classification and regression models.
They aggregate equally weighted CART trees, generated randomly in RF or
sequentially in XGBoost. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Forests (AF), a
novel approach that adaptively selects the weights of the underlying CART
models. AF combines (a) the Optimal Predictive-Policy Trees (OP2T) framework to
prescribe tailored, input-dependent unequal weights to trees and (b) Mixed
Integer Optimization (MIO) to refine weight candidates dynamically, enhancing
overall performance. We demonstrate that AF consistently outperforms RF,
XGBoost, and other weighted RF in binary and multi-class classification
problems over 20+ real-world datasets.

### [569] [Softmax is $1/2$-Lipschitz: A tight bound across all $\ell_p$ norms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23012)
*Pravin Nair*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文证明softmax函数在所有ℓ_p范数(p≥1)下具有统一的1/2 Lipschitz常数，比传统认为的1更紧，并展示了这一更紧常数如何改进现有关于鲁棒性和收敛性的理论结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习模型和优化算法通常假设softmax算子的Lipschitz常数为1，但这一假设可能不够精确。本文旨在提供更精确的softmax Lipschitz常数分析，以改进相关理论保证。

Method: 通过理论分析证明softmax函数在所有ℓ_p范数(p≥1)下的Lipschitz常数统一为1/2，并对局部Lipschitz常数进行详细分析。通过实验在注意力架构(ViT、GPT-2、Qwen3-8B)和强化学习策略中验证结果的尖锐性。

Result: 证明了softmax在所有ℓ_p范数(p≥1)下具有统一的1/2 Lipschitz常数，对于p=1和p=∞，局部Lipschitz常数达到1/2，而对于p∈(1,∞)，局部常数严格小于1/2，上确界1/2仅在极限情况下达到。

Conclusion: 本文首次提供了softmax Lipschitz连续性的全面范数统一分析，1/2的Lipschitz常数比传统假设的1更精确，能够直接改进现有关于鲁棒性和收敛性的理论结果。

Abstract: The softmax function is a basic operator in machine learning and
optimization, used in classification, attention mechanisms, reinforcement
learning, game theory, and problems involving log-sum-exp terms. Existing
robustness guarantees of learning models and convergence analysis of
optimization algorithms typically consider the softmax operator to have a
Lipschitz constant of $1$ with respect to the $\ell_2$ norm. In this work, we
prove that the softmax function is contractive with the Lipschitz constant
$1/2$, uniformly across all $\ell_p$ norms with $p \ge 1$. We also show that
the local Lipschitz constant of softmax attains $1/2$ for $p = 1$ and $p =
\infty$, and for $p \in (1,\infty)$, the constant remains strictly below $1/2$
and the supremum $1/2$ is achieved only in the limit. To our knowledge, this is
the first comprehensive norm-uniform analysis of softmax Lipschitz continuity.
We demonstrate how the sharper constant directly improves a range of existing
theoretical results on robustness and convergence. We further validate the
sharpness of the $1/2$ Lipschitz constant of the softmax operator through
empirical studies on attention-based architectures (ViT, GPT-2, Qwen3-8B) and
on stochastic policies in reinforcement learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoEMeta是一个用于少样本知识图谱关系学习的元学习框架，通过混合专家模型学习全局共享关系原型，并结合任务定制适应机制来平衡全局泛化和局部适应能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在孤立学习关系元知识时无法捕捉跨任务共享的关系模式，且难以有效整合对快速适应至关重要的局部任务特定上下文。

Method: 提出MoEMeta框架，包含：(i)混合专家模型学习全局共享关系原型；(ii)任务定制适应机制捕获局部上下文进行快速任务特定适应。

Result: 在三个知识图谱基准测试上的广泛实验表明，MoEMeta始终优于现有基线方法，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过平衡全局泛化与局部适应能力，MoEMeta显著推进了少样本关系学习的发展。

Abstract: Few-shot knowledge graph relational learning seeks to perform reasoning over
relations given only a limited number of training examples. While existing
approaches largely adopt a meta-learning framework for enabling fast adaptation
to new relations, they suffer from two key pitfalls. First, they learn relation
meta-knowledge in isolation, failing to capture common relational patterns
shared across tasks. Second, they struggle to effectively incorporate local,
task-specific contexts crucial for rapid adaptation. To address these
limitations, we propose MoEMeta, a novel meta-learning framework that
disentangles globally shared knowledge from task-specific contexts to enable
both effective generalization and rapid adaptation. MoEMeta introduces two key
innovations: (i) a mixture-of-experts (MoE) model that learns globally shared
relational prototypes to enhance generalization, and (ii) a task-tailored
adaptation mechanism that captures local contexts for fast task-specific
adaptation. By balancing global generalization with local adaptability, MoEMeta
significantly advances few-shot relational learning. Extensive experiments and
analyses on three KG benchmarks demonstrate that MoEMeta consistently
outperforms existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: 验证了定制构建系统直接从图像翻译文本的可行性。

Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end multilingual translation pipeline that
integrates a custom U-Net for text detection, the Tesseract engine for text
recognition, and a from-scratch sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) Transformer for
Neural Machine Translation (NMT). Our approach first utilizes a U-Net model,
trained on a synthetic dataset , to accurately segment and detect text regions
from an image. These detected regions are then processed by Tesseract to
extract the source text. This extracted text is fed into a custom Transformer
model trained from scratch on a multilingual parallel corpus spanning 5
languages. Unlike systems reliant on monolithic pre-trained models, our
architecture emphasizes full customization and adaptability. The system is
evaluated on its text detection accuracy, text recognition quality, and
translation performance via BLEU scores. The complete pipeline demonstrates
promising results, validating the viability of a custom-built system for
translating text directly from images.

TL;DR: Sentinel是一个个性化的联邦入侵检测系统框架，采用双模型架构（个性化教师模型和轻量共享学生模型），通过双向知识蒸馏、多层面特征对齐和类别平衡损失函数解决IoT网络中联邦学习面临的类别不平衡、非IID数据和高通信开销问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统联邦学习方法在IoT网络入侵检测系统中面临严重类别不平衡、非IID数据分布和高通信开销的挑战，导致性能下降，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 提出Sentinel框架，包含双模型架构（个性化教师模型和轻量共享学生模型）、双向知识蒸馏与自适应温度缩放、多层面特征对齐、类别平衡损失函数，以及服务器端的归一化梯度聚合与等权重客户端处理。

Result: 在IoTID20和5GNIDD基准数据集上的实验表明，Sentinel显著优于最先进的联邦学习方法，在极端数据异构情况下建立了新的性能基准，同时保持通信效率。

Conclusion: Sentinel通过个性化联邦学习框架有效解决了IoT入侵检测系统中的关键挑战，在性能、隐私保护和通信效率方面均表现出色。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving paradigm for machine
learning, but its application in intrusion detection systems (IDS) within IoT
networks is challenged by severe class imbalance, non-IID data, and high
communication overhead.These challenges severely degrade the performance of
conventional FL methods in real-world network traffic classification. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Sentinel, a personalized federated IDS
(pFed-IDS) framework that incorporates a dual-model architecture on each
client, consisting of a personalized teacher and a lightweight shared student
model. This design effectively balances deep local adaptation with efficient
global model consensus while preserving client privacy by transmitting only the
compact student model, thus reducing communication costs. Sentinel integrates
three key mechanisms to ensure robust performance: bidirectional knowledge
distillation with adaptive temperature scaling, multi-faceted feature
alignment, and class-balanced loss functions. Furthermore, the server employs
normalized gradient aggregation with equal client weighting to enhance fairness
and mitigate client drift. Extensive experiments on the IoTID20 and 5GNIDD
benchmark datasets demonstrate that Sentinel significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art federated methods, establishing a new performance benchmark,
especially under extreme data heterogeneity, while maintaining communication
efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准掩码扩散模型无法有效捕获并发预测token间的依赖关系，这在token间依赖很重要时会降低生成质量。

Method: 在掩码扩散过程中引入潜变量，通过变分推断来显式建模token间的依赖关系。

Result: 在合成数据集上成功学习了传统掩码扩散无法捕获的依赖关系；在数独谜题和文本数据集上提高了全局一致性；增强了生成质量和依赖感知能力。

Conclusion: 将变分推断集成到掩码扩散中具有重要价值，VMD框架能够有效提升离散生成建模的性能。

Abstract: Masked diffusion models have recently emerged as a flexible framework for
discrete generative modeling. However, a key limitation of standard masked
diffusion is its inability to effectively capture dependencies among tokens
that are predicted concurrently, leading to degraded generation quality when
dependencies among tokens are important. To explicitly model dependencies among
tokens, we propose Variational Masked Diffusion (VMD), a framework that
introduces latent variables into the masked diffusion process. Through
controlled experiments on synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that VMD
successfully learns dependencies that conventional masked diffusion fails to
capture. We further validate the effectiveness of our approach on Sudoku
puzzles and text datasets, where learning of dependencies among tokens improves
global consistency. Across these domains, VMD enhances both generation quality
and dependency awareness, highlighting the value of integrating variational
inference into masked diffusion. Our code is available at:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了针对动态数据流的近似最近邻搜索和近似核密度估计的亚线性空间草图算法，在流式模型和滑动窗口模型下实现了内存和查询时间的亚线性保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大规模和动态数据流中，设计紧凑的草图来保留数据结构特性同时支持高效查询是一个核心挑战。现有工作主要关注精确最近邻搜索，而近似最近邻搜索的亚线性草图研究不足。

Method: 使用局部敏感哈希(LSH)技术，在流式模型中设计亚线性内存草图，仅存储总输入的一小部分；在滑动窗口模型中构建紧凑草图结构，支持高效的近似核密度估计。

Result: 在流式模型中实现了O(n^(1+ρ-η))内存使用，支持亚线性查询时间和批量查询；在滑动窗口模型中提供了首个理论亚线性草图保证，实验验证了方法的轻量级和低误差特性。

Conclusion: 该工作首次为动态数据流中的近似最近邻搜索和近似核密度估计提供了理论亚线性草图保证，填补了现有研究的空白，并在实际数据集上验证了有效性。

Abstract: Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search and Approximate Kernel Density
Estimation (A-KDE) are fundamental problems at the core of modern machine
learning, with broad applications in data analysis, information systems, and
large-scale decision making. In massive and dynamic data streams, a central
challenge is to design compact sketches that preserve essential structural
properties of the data while enabling efficient queries.
  In this work, we develop new sketching algorithms that achieve sublinear
space and query time guarantees for both ANN and A-KDE for a dynamic stream of
data. For ANN in the streaming model, under natural assumptions, we design a
sublinear sketch that requires only $\mathcal{O}(n^{1+\rho-\eta})$ memory by
storing only a sublinear ($n^{-\eta}$) fraction of the total inputs, where
$\rho$ is a parameter of the LSH family, and $0<\eta<1$. Our method supports
sublinear query time, batch queries, and extends to the more general Turnstile
model. While earlier works have focused on Exact NN, this is the first result
on ANN that achieves near-optimal trade-offs between memory size and
approximation error.
  Next, for A-KDE in the Sliding-Window model, we propose a sketch of size
$\mathcal{O}\left(RW \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\epsilon} - 1} \log^2 N\right)$,
where $R$ is the number of sketch rows, $W$ is the LSH range, $N$ is the window
size, and $\epsilon$ is the approximation error. This, to the best of our
knowledge, is the first theoretical sublinear sketch guarantee for A-KDE in the
Sliding-Window model.
  We complement our theoretical results with experiments on various real-world
datasets, which show that the proposed sketches are lightweight and achieve
consistently low error in practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有晶体生成方法存在互补缺陷：大语言模型擅长处理离散原子类型但难以处理连续特征（原子位置、晶格参数），而扩散模型擅长连续变量但难以生成准确的原子组成。需要结合两者优势。

Method: 提出CrysLLMGen混合框架：首先使用微调的大语言模型生成原子类型、原子坐标和晶格结构的中间表示，然后保留预测的原子类型，将原子坐标和晶格结构传递给预训练的等变扩散模型进行细化。

Conclusion: CrysLLMGen通过结合大语言模型和扩散模型的互补优势，成功解决了晶体材料生成中的关键挑战，展现出强大的条件生成能力，能够有效满足用户定义的约束条件。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have shown significant promise in
designing novel periodic crystal structures. Existing approaches typically rely
on either large language models (LLMs) or equivariant denoising models, each
with complementary strengths: LLMs excel at handling discrete atomic types but
often struggle with continuous features such as atomic positions and lattice
parameters, while denoising models are effective at modeling continuous
variables but encounter difficulties in generating accurate atomic
compositions. To bridge this gap, we propose CrysLLMGen, a hybrid framework
that integrates an LLM with a diffusion model to leverage their complementary
strengths for crystal material generation. During sampling, CrysLLMGen first
employs a fine-tuned LLM to produce an intermediate representation of atom
types, atomic coordinates, and lattice structure. While retaining the predicted
atom types, it passes the atomic coordinates and lattice structure to a
pre-trained equivariant diffusion model for refinement. Our framework
outperforms state-of-the-art generative models across several benchmark tasks
and datasets. Specifically, CrysLLMGen not only achieves a balanced performance
in terms of structural and compositional validity but also generates more
stable and novel materials compared to LLM-based and denoisingbased models
Furthermore, CrysLLMGen exhibits strong conditional generation capabilities,
effectively producing materials that satisfy user-defined constraints. Code is

Motivation: 调和强化学习中针对可验证奖励的Pass@K目标的两种看似不同的策略梯度优化方法，揭示它们的内在联系和等价性。

Method: 通过逆向工程现有优势塑造算法，揭示它们隐式优化代理奖励；同时从代理奖励目标出发，提供推导现有和新型优势塑造方法的简单方法。

Result: 证明了直接REINFORCE风格方法和优势塑造技术实际上是等价的，为RLVR策略梯度优化提供了新的理论视角。

Conclusion: 这种统一视角为超越Pass@K原始动机的RLVR策略梯度优化提供了理论框架，揭示了不同方法之间的深层联系。

Abstract: This note reconciles two seemingly distinct approaches to policy gradient
optimization for the Pass@K objective in reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards: (1) direct REINFORCE-style methods, and (2) advantage-shaping
techniques that directly modify GRPO. We show that these are two sides of the
same coin. By reverse-engineering existing advantage-shaping algorithms, we
reveal that they implicitly optimize surrogate rewards. We specifically
interpret practical ``hard-example up-weighting'' modifications to GRPO as
reward-level regularization. Conversely, starting from surrogate reward
objectives, we provide a simple recipe for deriving both existing and new
advantage-shaping methods. This perspective provides a lens for RLVR policy
gradient optimization beyond our original motivation of Pass@K.

Abstract: Pre-trained models exhibit strong generalization to various downstream tasks.
However, given the numerous models available in the model hub, identifying the
most suitable one by individually fine-tuning is time-consuming. In this paper,
we propose \textbf{SwiftTS}, a swift selection framework for time series
pre-trained models. To avoid expensive forward propagation through all
candidates, SwiftTS adopts a learning-guided approach that leverages historical
dataset-model performance pairs across diverse horizons to predict model
performance on unseen datasets. It employs a lightweight dual-encoder
architecture that embeds time series and candidate models with rich
characteristics, computing patchwise compatibility scores between data and
model embeddings for efficient selection. To further enhance the generalization
across datasets and horizons, we introduce a horizon-adaptive expert
composition module that dynamically adjusts expert weights, and the
transferable cross-task learning with cross-dataset and cross-horizon task
sampling to enhance out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness. Extensive experiments
on 14 downstream datasets and 8 pre-trained models demonstrate that SwiftTS
achieves state-of-the-art performance in time series pre-trained model
selection.

Abstract: Multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) cooperative Mobile Edge Computing
(MEC) systems face critical challenges in coordinating trajectory planning,
task offloading, and resource allocation while ensuring Quality of Service
(QoS) under dynamic and uncertain environments. Existing approaches suffer from
limited scalability, slow convergence, and inefficient knowledge sharing among
UAVs, particularly when handling large-scale IoT device deployments with
stringent deadline constraints. This paper proposes AirFed, a novel federated
graph-enhanced multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that addresses
these challenges through three key innovations. First, we design dual-layer
dynamic Graph Attention Networks (GATs) that explicitly model spatial-temporal
dependencies among UAVs and IoT devices, capturing both service relationships
and collaborative interactions within the network topology. Second, we develop
a dual-Actor single-Critic architecture that jointly optimizes continuous
trajectory control and discrete task offloading decisions. Third, we propose a
reputation-based decentralized federated learning mechanism with
gradient-sensitive adaptive quantization, enabling efficient and robust
knowledge sharing across heterogeneous UAVs. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that AirFed achieves 42.9% reduction in weighted cost compared to
state-of-the-art baselines, attains over 99% deadline satisfaction and 94.2%
IoT device coverage rate, and reduces communication overhead by 54.5%.
Scalability analysis confirms robust performance across varying UAV numbers,
IoT device densities, and system scales, validating AirFed's practical
applicability for large-scale UAV-MEC deployments.

Conclusion: TCSIS提供了一种无需目标分布样本或配分函数计算的有效采样方法，在离散状态空间采样问题上表现出良好性能。

Abstract: We introduce the Target Concrete Score Identity Sampler (TCSIS), a method for
sampling from unnormalized densities on discrete state spaces by learning the
reverse dynamics of a Continuous-Time Markov Chain (CTMC). Our approach builds
on a forward in time CTMC with a uniform noising kernel and relies on the
proposed Target Concrete Score Identity, which relates the concrete score, the
ratio of marginal probabilities of two states, to a ratio of expectations of
Boltzmann factors under the forward uniform diffusion kernel. This formulation
enables Monte Carlo estimation of the concrete score without requiring samples
from the target distribution or computation of the partition function. We
approximate the concrete score with a neural network and propose two
algorithms: Self-Normalized TCSIS and Unbiased TCSIS. Finally, we demonstrate
the effectiveness of TCSIS on problems from statistical physics.

Motivation: 挑战传统观点——神经算子性能受限于训练数据的精度，探索神经网络能否通过学习隐式规律超越训练数据的限制。

Method: 理论分析模拟器归纳偏置、训练目标和数值误差特性之间的相互作用，并通过不同PDE和标准神经网络架构进行实证验证。

Conclusion: 这项工作促使重新评估模拟器基准测试，表明神经模拟器在特定操作机制下可能实现比训练数据源更高的物理保真度。

Abstract: Neural operators or emulators for PDEs trained on data from numerical solvers
are conventionally assumed to be limited by their training data's fidelity. We
challenge this assumption by identifying "emulator superiority," where neural
networks trained purely on low-fidelity solver data can achieve higher accuracy
than those solvers when evaluated against a higher-fidelity reference. Our
theoretical analysis reveals how the interplay between emulator inductive
biases, training objectives, and numerical error characteristics enables
superior performance during multi-step rollouts. We empirically validate this
finding across different PDEs using standard neural architectures,
demonstrating that emulators can implicitly learn dynamics that are more
regularized or exhibit more favorable error accumulation properties than their
training data, potentially surpassing training data limitations and mitigating
numerical artifacts. This work prompts a re-evaluation of emulator
benchmarking, suggesting neural emulators might achieve greater physical
fidelity than their training source within specific operational regimes.

Abstract: Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are gaining attention for their
ability to embed physical laws into deep learning models, which is particularly
useful in structural engineering tasks with limited data. This paper aims to
explore the use of PINNs to predict the weight of small scale spaghetti
bridges, a task relevant to understanding load limits and potential failure
modes in simplified structural models. Our proposed framework incorporates
physics-based constraints to the prediction model for improved performance. In
addition to standard PINNs, we introduce a novel architecture named Physics
Informed Kolmogorov Arnold Network (PIKAN), which blends universal function
approximation theory with physical insights. The structural parameters provided
as input to the model are collected either manually or through computer vision
methods. Our dataset includes 15 real bridges, augmented to 100 samples, and
our best model achieves an $R^2$ score of 0.9603 and a mean absolute error
(MAE) of 10.50 units. From applied perspective, we also provide a web based
interface for parameter entry and prediction. These results show that PINNs can
offer reliable estimates of structural weight, even with limited data, and may
help inform early stage failure analysis in lightweight bridge designs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 基于聚类过程的异常值检测方法，设计四个标准来模拟人类专家在分析聚类后视觉识别异常值的过程。

Result: 在两个医学领域（稳定测量和脑电图）的评估中，假阳性率低于2%，可靠性大于99%，回归分析证实该方法在不同领域有效。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效检测不同领域的异常数据，具有较低的假阳性率和较高的可靠性。

Abstract: Outlier detection is an important problem occurring in a wide range of areas.
Outliers are the outcome of fraudulent behaviour, mechanical faults, human
error, or simply natural deviations. Many data mining applications perform
outlier detection, often as a preliminary step in order to filter out outliers
and build more representative models. In this paper, we propose an outlier
detection method based on a clustering process. The aim behind the proposal
outlined in this paper is to overcome the specificity of many existing outlier
detection techniques that fail to take into account the inherent dispersion of
domain objects. The outlier detection method is based on four criteria designed
to represent how human beings (experts in each domain) visually identify
outliers within a set of objects after analysing the clusters. This has an
advantage over other clustering-based outlier detection techniques that are
founded on a purely numerical analysis of clusters. Our proposal has been
evaluated, with satisfactory results, on data (particularly time series) from
two different domains: stabilometry, a branch of medicine studying
balance-related functions in human beings and electroencephalography (EEG), a
neurological exploration used to diagnose nervous system disorders. To validate
the proposed method, we studied method outlier detection and efficiency in
terms of runtime. The results of regression analyses confirm that our proposal
is useful for detecting outlier data in different domains, with a false
positive rate of less than 2% and a reliability greater than 99%.

*Aryan Mathur,Asaduddin Ahmed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了感知-决策交错Transformer架构，通过在同一Transformer中交替感知和决策层，让决策反馈动态优化感知特征，在BabyAI环境中比标准PPO基线表现更稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统架构将感知和决策分离，导致策略失败无法直接帮助感知模块学习重要信息，这种分离效率低下。

Method: 实现PDiT架构，在单一Transformer中交替感知和决策层，并集成CLIP启发的对比损失来对齐文本任务嵌入和视觉场景特征。

Result: 在BabyAI GoToLocal环境中评估，该方法比标准PPO基线获得更稳定的奖励和更强的对齐效果。

Conclusion: 交错Transformer编码器是开发更集成自主代理的有前景方向。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning agents often struggle when tasks require
understanding both vision and language. Conventional architectures typically
isolate perception (for example, CNN-based visual encoders) from
decision-making (policy networks). This separation can be inefficient, since
the policy's failures do not directly help the perception module learn what is
important. To address this, we implement the Perception-Decision Interleaving
Transformer (PDiT) architecture introduced by Mao et al. (2023), a model that
alternates between perception and decision layers within a single transformer.
This interleaving allows feedback from decision-making to refine perceptual
features dynamically. In addition, we integrate a contrastive loss inspired by
CLIP to align textual mission embeddings with visual scene features. We
evaluate the PDiT encoders on the BabyAI GoToLocal environment and find that
the approach achieves more stable rewards and stronger alignment compared to a
standard PPO baseline. The results suggest that interleaved transformer
encoders are a promising direction for developing more integrated autonomous
agents.

*Koki Shibata,Tianheng Ling,Chao Qian,Tomokazu Matsui,Hirohiko Suwa,Keiichi Yasumoto,Gregor Schiele*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于FPGA的能效振动手势识别系统，通过原始波形输入、轻量网络架构和量化优化，在低功耗硬件上实现实时手势识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有振动手势识别方法依赖复杂预处理和大规模神经网络，需要高性能硬件且能耗高，限制了实际部署。需要开发能在低功耗设备上运行的能效解决方案。

Method: 采用原始波形输入替代复杂频谱预处理；设计两种轻量网络架构(1D-CNN和1D-SepCNN)；使用整数量化和自动RTL生成；扩展硬件感知搜索框架支持约束驱动配置选择。

Result: 在AMD Spartan-7 FPGA上，6位1D-CNN达到0.970平均准确率和9.22ms延迟；8位1D-SepCNN延迟降至6.83ms(比CPU快53倍)，准确率0.949；每次推理能耗低于1.2mJ。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持竞争力的准确率同时，显著降低了计算复杂度和能耗，证明了在低功耗边缘设备上长期运行的可行性。

Abstract: The growing demand for smart home interfaces has increased interest in
non-intrusive sensing methods like vibration-based gesture recognition. While
prior studies demonstrated feasibility, they often rely on complex
preprocessing and large Neural Networks (NNs) requiring costly high-performance
hardware, resulting in high energy usage and limited real-world deployability.
This study proposes an energy-efficient solution deploying compact NNs on
low-power Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) to enable real-time gesture
recognition with competitive accuracy. We adopt a series of optimizations: (1)
We replace complex spectral preprocessing with raw waveform input, eliminating
complex on-board preprocessing while reducing input size by 21x without
sacrificing accuracy. (2) We design two lightweight architectures (1D-CNN and
1D-SepCNN) tailored for embedded FPGAs, reducing parameters from 369 million to
as few as 216 while maintaining comparable accuracy. (3) With integer-only
quantization and automated RTL generation, we achieve seamless FPGA deployment.
A ping-pong buffering mechanism in 1D-SepCNN further improves deployability
under tight memory constraints. (4) We extend a hardware-aware search framework
to support constraint-driven model configuration selection, considering
accuracy, deployability, latency, and energy consumption. Evaluated on two
swipe-direction datasets with multiple users and ordinary tables, our approach
achieves low-latency, energy-efficient inference on the AMD Spartan-7 XC7S25
FPGA. Under the PS data splitting setting, the selected 6-bit 1D-CNN reaches
0.970 average accuracy across users with 9.22 ms latency. The chosen 8-bit
1D-SepCNN further reduces latency to 6.83 ms (over 53x CPU speedup) with
slightly lower accuracy (0.949). Both consume under 1.2 mJ per inference,
demonstrating suitability for long-term edge operation.

*Timo Freiesleben,Sebastian Zezulka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了预测基准测试的构建效度条件，通过三个案例研究分析了基准分数支持科学推断的前提假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测基准测试在机器学习研究中被广泛使用，但仅凭基准分数无法直接支持科学推断，需要明确其背后的理论假设。

Method: 借鉴心理测量理论开发构建效度条件，并通过ImageNet、WeatherBench和Fragile Families Challenge三个案例研究验证这些假设。

Result: 明确了基准分数支持科学推断所需的学习问题、评估函数和数据分布等理论结构假设。

Conclusion: 该框架阐明了基准分数支持多样化科学主张的条件，将预测基准测试视为机器学习中的认识论实践和概念推理场所。

Abstract: Predictive benchmarking, the evaluation of machine learning models based on
predictive performance and competitive ranking, is a central epistemic practice
in machine learning research and an increasingly prominent method for
scientific inquiry. Yet, benchmark scores alone provide at best measurements of
model performance relative to an evaluation dataset and a concrete learning
problem. Drawing substantial scientific inferences from the results, say about
theoretical tasks like image classification, requires additional assumptions
about the theoretical structure of the learning problems, evaluation functions,
and data distributions. We make these assumptions explicit by developing
conditions of construct validity inspired by psychological measurement theory.
We examine these assumptions in practice through three case studies, each
exemplifying a typical intended inference: measuring engineering progress in
computer vision with ImageNet; evaluating policy-relevant weather predictions
with WeatherBench; and examining limitations of the predictability of life
events with the Fragile Families Challenge. Our framework clarifies the
conditions under which benchmark scores can support diverse scientific claims,
bringing predictive benchmarking into perspective as an epistemological
practice and a key site of conceptual and theoretical reasoning in machine
learning.

*Amal Abed,Ivan Lukic,Jörg K. H. Franke,Frank Hutter*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种可扩展的合成数据生成流程，创建了80万个包含指令-推理-代码-测试的四元组数据集，通过微调LLMs在编程基准测试中实现了持续改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码生成数据集大多只包含问题与解决方案的配对，缺乏指导编程的中间思维过程，限制了LLMs在代码生成方面的进展。

Method: 结合四个关键组件：精选竞赛问题、通过相关性分类器筛选的网络挖掘内容、基于推理模式的数据扩展、多阶段基于执行的验证，并使用遗传变异算法增加任务多样性。

Result: 在该数据集上微调的LLMs在编程基准测试中表现一致提升，推理感知数据可以替代模型扩展，在不同架构间具有泛化能力，在相同样本预算下优于领先的开源替代方案。

Conclusion: 以推理为中心的合成数据生成是提升LLMs编程能力的高效方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive promise in code
generation, yet their progress remains limited by the shortage of large-scale
datasets that are both diverse and well-aligned with human reasoning. Most
existing resources pair problems with solutions, but omit the intermediate
thought process that guides coding. To close this gap, we present a scalable
synthetic data generation pipeline that produces nearly 800k
instruction-reasoning-code-test quadruplets. Each sample combines a task, a
step-by-step reasoning trace, a working solution, and executable tests,
enabling models to learn not just the what but also the how of problem solving.
Our pipeline combines four key components: curated contest problems, web-mined
content filtered by relevance classifiers, data expansion guided by reasoning
patterns, and multi-stage execution-based validation. A genetic mutation
algorithm further increases task diversity while maintaining consistency
between reasoning traces and code implementations. Our key finding is that
fine-tuning LLMs on this dataset yields consistent improvements on coding
benchmarks. Beyond raw accuracy, reasoning-aware data can substitute for model
scaling, generalize across architectures, and outperform leading open-source
alternatives under identical sample budgets. Our work establishes
reasoning-centered synthetic data generation as an efficient approach for
advancing coding capabilities in LLMs. We publish our dataset and generation
pipeline to facilitate further research.

### [587] [Accelerating Eigenvalue Dataset Generation via Chebyshev Subspace Filter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23215)
*Hong Wang,Jie Wang,Jian Luo,huanshuo dong,Yeqiu Chen,Runmin Jiang,Zhen huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SCSF的新方法，通过利用算子间的相似性来加速特征值数据生成，相比传统数值求解器可获得3.5倍的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经网络特征值方法需要大量带标签数据（算子和特征值）进行训练，数据生成成本高昂。现有方法忽略了算子间的相似性这一重要因素。

Method: 使用截断快速傅里叶变换排序将具有相似特征值分布的算子分组，构建切比雪夫子空间滤波器，利用已解决问题的特征对来辅助解决后续问题，减少冗余计算。

Result: 实验结果显示SCSF相比各种数值求解器实现了最高3.5倍的加速。

Conclusion: SCSF是首个加速特征值数据生成的方法，通过利用算子相似性显著提高了数据生成效率。

Abstract: Eigenvalue problems are among the most important topics in many scientific
disciplines. With the recent surge and development of machine learning, neural
eigenvalue methods have attracted significant attention as a forward pass of
inference requires only a tiny fraction of the computation time compared to
traditional solvers. However, a key limitation is the requirement for large
amounts of labeled data in training, including operators and their eigenvalues.
To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel method, named Sorting Chebyshev
Subspace Filter (SCSF), which significantly accelerates eigenvalue data
generation by leveraging similarities between operators -- a factor overlooked
by existing methods. Specifically, SCSF employs truncated fast Fourier
transform sorting to group operators with similar eigenvalue distributions and
constructs a Chebyshev subspace filter that leverages eigenpairs from
previously solved problems to assist in solving subsequent ones, reducing
redundant computations. To the best of our knowledge, SCSF is the first method
to accelerate eigenvalue data generation. Experimental results show that SCSF
achieves up to a $3.5\times$ speedup compared to various numerical solvers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Grassmann流形上黎曼插值的低通图滤波器插值算法，用于参数化图族，避免了重复求解特征值问题的高计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在非欧几里得域上进行图信号处理时，计算参数化图族的低通图滤波器成本过高，因为需要重复求解特征值问题来计算低频子空间。

Method: 基于Grassmann流形上的黎曼插值，在法坐标中进行低通图滤波器插值，并推导了子空间插值的误差界估计。

Result: 提出了两种应用：1）通过相似性校正将节点特征的时间演化转化为图拓扑演化；2）通过给定静态图诱导的点积图族，利用滤波器插值改进节点分类的消息传递方案。

Conclusion: 该方法为参数化图族提供了一种高效的低通图滤波器插值方案，避免了昂贵的特征值计算，并展示了在动态图拓扑和节点分类中的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Low-pass graph filters are fundamental for signal processing on graphs and
other non-Euclidean domains. However, the computation of such filters for
parametric graph families can be prohibitively expensive as computation of the
corresponding low-frequency subspaces, requires the repeated solution of an
eigenvalue problem. We suggest a novel algorithm of low-pass graph filter
interpolation based on Riemannian interpolation in normal coordinates on the
Grassmann manifold. We derive an error bound estimate for the subspace
interpolation and suggest two possible applications for induced parametric
graph families. First, we argue that the temporal evolution of the node
features may be translated to the evolving graph topology via a similarity
correction to adjust the homophily degree of the network. Second, we suggest a
dot product graph family induced by a given static graph which allows to infer
improved message passing scheme for node classification facilitated by the
filter interpolation.

TL;DR: 提出了AC-HQMM模型和RILA算法，用于在对抗性数据污染下稳健学习量子隐马尔可夫模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HQMM学习算法对数据污染高度敏感，缺乏对抗性扰动下的鲁棒性保证机制

Method: 提出RILA算法，结合RCR-EF模块和迭代随机重采样过程，使用L1惩罚似然目标来增强稳定性

Result: 在多个基准测试中，RILA表现出优越的收敛稳定性、污染恢复能力和物理有效性保持

Conclusion: 建立了一种原则性且高效的鲁棒量子序列学习方法

Abstract: Hidden Quantum Markov Models (HQMMs) extend classical Hidden Markov Models to
the quantum domain, offering a powerful probabilistic framework for modeling
sequential data with quantum coherence. However, existing HQMM learning
algorithms are highly sensitive to data corruption and lack mechanisms to
ensure robustness under adversarial perturbations. In this work, we introduce
the Adversarially Corrupted HQMM (AC-HQMM), which formalizes robustness
analysis by allowing a controlled fraction of observation sequences to be
adversarially corrupted. To learn AC-HQMMs, we propose the Robust Iterative
Learning Algorithm (RILA), a derivative-free method that integrates a Remove
Corrupted Rows by Entropy Filtering (RCR-EF) module with an iterative
stochastic resampling procedure for physically valid Kraus operator updates.
RILA incorporates L1-penalized likelihood objectives to enhance stability,
resist overfitting, and remain effective under non-differentiable conditions.
Across multiple HQMM and HMM benchmarks, RILA demonstrates superior convergence
stability, corruption resilience, and preservation of physical validity
compared to existing algorithms, establishing a principled and efficient
approach for robust quantum sequential learning.

*Qi Li,Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出GCAO聚类算法，通过群体驱动的引力优化机制解决高维非均匀数据中低密度边界样本易受干扰的问题，显著提升聚类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统聚类算法在处理高维和非均匀分布数据时，低密度边界样本容易被邻近聚类干扰，导致聚类结果不稳定和扭曲。

Method: 引入群体级优化机制，将低密度边界点聚合成协作移动的群体，结合局部密度估计和邻域拓扑构建有效的引力相互作用，使用群体作为基本运动单元进行引力收缩。

Result: 在多个高维数据集上，GCAO优于11种代表性聚类方法，NMI、ARI、Homogeneity和ACC分别平均提升37.13%、52.08%、44.98%和38.81%，同时保持竞争性的效率和可扩展性。

Conclusion: GCAO在保持聚类完整性、增强边界可分性和确保复杂数据分布上的鲁棒性能方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: Traditional clustering algorithms often struggle with high-dimensional and
non-uniformly distributed data, where low-density boundary samples are easily
disturbed by neighboring clusters, leading to unstable and distorted clustering
results. To address this issue, we propose a Group-driven Clustering via
Gravitational Attraction and Optimization (GCAO) algorithm. GCAO introduces a
group-level optimization mechanism that aggregates low-density boundary points
into collaboratively moving groups, replacing the traditional point-based
contraction process. By combining local density estimation with neighborhood
topology, GCAO constructs effective gravitational interactions between groups
and their surroundings, enhancing boundary clarity and structural consistency.
Using groups as basic motion units, a gravitational contraction strategy
ensures globally stable and directionally consistent convergence. Experiments
on multiple high-dimensional datasets demonstrate that GCAO outperforms 11
representative clustering methods, achieving average improvements of 37.13%,
52.08%, 44.98%, and 38.81% in NMI, ARI, Homogeneity, and ACC, respectively,
while maintaining competitive efficiency and scalability. These results
highlight GCAO's superiority in preserving cluster integrity, enhancing
boundary separability, and ensuring robust performance on complex data
distributions.

*Félix Chavelli,Paul Boniol,Michaël Thomazo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了两种新的时间序列分割评估指标WARI和SMS，解决了现有指标在捕捉分割质量、错误性质和可解释性方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列分割评估方法主要关注变化点准确性或使用基于点的指标如ARI，这些方法无法捕捉检测到的分割段质量、忽略错误性质且可解释性有限。

Method: 引入WARI（加权调整兰德指数）考虑分割错误的位置，以及SMS（状态匹配分数）这一细粒度指标，能够识别和评分四种基本类型的分割错误并允许错误特定加权。

Result: 在合成和真实世界基准测试中经验验证了WARI和SMS，表明它们不仅提供更准确的分割质量评估，还能揭示传统指标无法获取的错误来源和类型等洞察。

Conclusion: WARI和SMS为时间序列分割提供了更全面、准确的评估框架，能够更好地理解分割算法的性能特点和错误模式。

Abstract: Time series segmentation is a fundamental task in analyzing temporal data
across various domains, from human activity recognition to energy monitoring.
While numerous state-of-the-art methods have been developed to tackle this
problem, the evaluation of their performance remains critically limited.
Existing measures predominantly focus on change point accuracy or rely on
point-based measures such as Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), which fail to capture
the quality of the detected segments, ignore the nature of errors, and offer
limited interpretability. In this paper, we address these shortcomings by
introducing two novel evaluation measures: WARI (Weighted Adjusted Rand Index),
that accounts for the position of segmentation errors, and SMS (State Matching
Score), a fine-grained measure that identifies and scores four fundamental
types of segmentation errors while allowing error-specific weighting. We
empirically validate WARI and SMS on synthetic and real-world benchmarks,
showing that they not only provide a more accurate assessment of segmentation
quality but also uncover insights, such as error provenance and type, that are
inaccessible with traditional measures.

TL;DR: PAHQ是一种通过注意力头量化来加速自动电路发现的方法，将运行时间减少80%，内存消耗减少30%，同时保持分析忠实度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动电路发现方法在大型语言模型中存在计算效率低和内存需求高的问题，而现有的加速方法主要依赖线性近似，这会显著损害分析忠实度。

Method: PAHQ通过将激活修补与混合精度量化对齐，仅对研究的组件保持高精度，同时在网络其他地方安全降低精度，从而优化每个修补操作的效率。

Result: PAHQ加速的ACDC相比未加速版本，运行时间减少高达80%，内存消耗减少高达30%，同时保持忠实度。

Conclusion: PAHQ提供了一种无需训练的实际且新颖的途径，用于加速机制可解释性方法，并能与现有的基于边缘的电路发现技术无缝集成。

Abstract: Circuit discovery, which involves identifying sparse and task-relevant
subnetworks in pre-trained language models, is a cornerstone of mechanistic
interpretability. Automated Circuit Discovery (ACDC) has emerged as a pivotal
methodology in circuit discovery, but its application to large language models
is severely limited by computational inefficiency and prohibitively high memory
requirements. Although several accelerated approaches have been proposed, they
primarily rely on linear approximations to ACDC, which significantly
compromises analytical faithfulness. Our proposed method for accelerating
automated circuit discovery, Per Attention Head Quantization (PAHQ), takes a
fundamentally different approach by optimizing the efficiency of each
individual patching operation. PAHQ leverages a fundamental alignment between
activation patching and mixed-precision quantization (MPQ): interpretability
analysis through patching essentially performs targeted ablation studies.
Therefore, we can maintain high precision exclusively for investigated
components while safely reducing precision elsewhere in the network.
PAHQ-accelerated ACDC reduces runtime by up to 80\% and memory consumption by
up to 30\% compared to unaccelerated ACDC while maintaining faithfulness.
Importantly, our method readily integrates with existing edge-based circuit
discovery techniques by modifying the attention computation mechanism. This
training-free approach provides a practical and novel pathway for accelerating
mechanistic interpretability methods. Our code is available at
https://github.com/626619403/PAHQ.

TL;DR: DAMPE是一个多模态蛋白质嵌入框架，通过最优传输对齐和条件图生成融合，解决蛋白质功能预测中的跨模态分布不匹配和噪声图数据问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蛋白质功能预测需要整合异质的内在信号（如序列和结构）和噪声的外在上下文（如蛋白质相互作用和GO注释），但跨模态分布不匹配和噪声关系图阻碍了有效融合。

Method: 提出OT-based表示对齐来建立不同模态内在嵌入空间的对应关系，以及CGG-based信息融合方法，通过条件编码器融合对齐的内在嵌入来重构图。

Result: 在标准GO基准测试中，DAMPE优于或匹配最先进方法如DPFunc，AUPR提升0.002-0.013pp，Fmax提升0.004-0.007pp。消融研究显示OT对齐贡献0.043-0.064pp AUPR，CGG融合贡献0.005-0.111pp Fmax。

Conclusion: DAMPE提供了一个可扩展且理论基础的鲁棒多模态蛋白质表示学习方法，显著增强了蛋白质功能预测能力。

Abstract: Accurate protein function prediction requires integrating heterogeneous
intrinsic signals (e.g., sequence and structure) with noisy extrinsic contexts
(e.g., protein-protein interactions and GO term annotations). However, two key
challenges hinder effective fusion: (i) cross-modal distributional mismatch
among embeddings produced by pre-trained intrinsic encoders, and (ii) noisy
relational graphs of extrinsic data that degrade GNN-based information
aggregation. We propose Diffused and Aligned Multi-modal Protein Embedding
(DAMPE), a unified framework that addresses these through two core mechanisms.
First, we propose Optimal Transport (OT)-based representation alignment that
establishes correspondence between intrinsic embedding spaces of different
modalities, effectively mitigating cross-modal heterogeneity. Second, we
develop a Conditional Graph Generation (CGG)-based information fusion method,
where a condition encoder fuses the aligned intrinsic embeddings to provide
informative cues for graph reconstruction. Meanwhile, our theoretical analysis
implies that the CGG objective drives this condition encoder to absorb
graph-aware knowledge into its produced protein representations. Empirically,
DAMPE outperforms or matches state-of-the-art methods such as DPFunc on
standard GO benchmarks, achieving AUPR gains of 0.002-0.013 pp and Fmax gains
0.004-0.007 pp. Ablation studies further show that OT-based alignment
contributes 0.043-0.064 pp AUPR, while CGG-based fusion adds 0.005-0.111 pp
Fmax. Overall, DAMPE offers a scalable and theoretically grounded approach for
robust multi-modal protein representation learning, substantially enhancing
protein function prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统等变神经网络依赖单一全局对称性，无法有效处理局部对称性普遍存在的领域。需要开发能够处理图上局部对称性的框架。

Method: 引入Torsor CNN框架，使用边势能（群值变换）编码局部对称性，提出Torsor卷积层和挫败损失作为几何正则化器。该框架在任意图上运行，无需全局坐标系或光滑流形结构。

Result: 建立了该几何构造与经典群同步问题的等价性，证明了Torsor卷积层对局部坐标系变化的等变性，并将框架应用于多视角3D识别任务。

Conclusion: Torsor CNN框架统一并推广了多种架构，包括经典CNN和流形上的Gauge CNN，为处理局部对称性问题提供了理论基础和实用工具。

Abstract: Most equivariant neural networks rely on a single global symmetry, limiting
their use in domains where symmetries are instead local. We introduce Torsor
CNNs, a framework for learning on graphs with local symmetries encoded as edge
potentials -- group-valued transformations between neighboring coordinate
frames. We establish that this geometric construction is fundamentally
equivalent to the classical group synchronization problem, yielding: (1) a
Torsor Convolutional Layer that is provably equivariant to local changes in
coordinate frames, and (2) the frustration loss -- a standalone geometric
regularizer that encourages locally equivariant representations when added to
any NN's training objective. The Torsor CNN framework unifies and generalizes
several architectures -- including classical CNNs and Gauge CNNs on manifolds
-- by operating on arbitrary graphs without requiring a global coordinate
system or smooth manifold structure. We establish the mathematical foundations
of this framework and demonstrate its applicability to multi-view 3D
recognition, where relative camera poses naturally define the required edge
potentials.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的符号回归方法通常只使用单个观测轨迹，而实际中往往有多个轨迹可用。MIO旨在利用这些重复观测来学习更准确和通用的动态系统表示。

Method: 结合多实例学习和基于Transformer的符号回归，研究不同的实例聚合策略（如简单均值聚合），在1到4维系统上评估，并考虑不同噪声水平。

Result: MIO在从1维到4维的各种系统和不同噪声水平下始终优于现有基线方法，即使简单的均值聚合也能显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 利用多个观测轨迹可以显著提高符号常微分方程推断的性能，MIO模型为从重复观测中学习动态系统提供了有效的框架。

Abstract: We introduce MIO, a transformer-based model for inferring symbolic ordinary
differential equations (ODEs) from multiple observed trajectories of a
dynamical system. By combining multiple instance learning with
transformer-based symbolic regression, the model effectively leverages repeated
observations of the same system to learn more generalizable representations of
the underlying dynamics. We investigate different instance aggregation
strategies and show that even simple mean aggregation can substantially boost
performance. MIO is evaluated on systems ranging from one to four dimensions
and under varying noise levels, consistently outperforming existing baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反向传播算法能耗高且不太可能在大脑中实现，预测编码作为大脑启发的替代算法具有潜在效率优势，但深层PC网络难以训练且动态机制理解不足。

Method: 采用优化理论方法分析PC学习动态，证明PC近似使用二阶信息的信任域方法，提出μPC参数化方法改进推理动态。

Result: PC可利用高阶信息，学习景观比MSE损失景观更良性且对梯度消失更鲁棒；μPC首次实现100+层网络稳定训练，在简单任务上具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 该论文显著推进了对PC网络推理和学习动态的基本理解，但PC要与BP在大规模应用竞争，未来研究需要关注硬件协同设计。

Abstract: Backpropagation (BP) is the standard algorithm for training the deep neural
networks that power modern artificial intelligence including large language
models. However, BP is energy inefficient and unlikely to be implemented by the
brain. This thesis studies an alternative, potentially more efficient
brain-inspired algorithm called predictive coding (PC). Unlike BP, PC networks
(PCNs) perform inference by iterative equilibration of neuron activities before
learning or weight updates. Recent work has suggested that this iterative
inference procedure provides a range of benefits over BP, such as faster
training. However, these advantages have not been consistently observed, the
inference and learning dynamics of PCNs are still poorly understood, and deep
PCNs remain practically untrainable. Here, we make significant progress towards
scaling PCNs by taking a theoretical approach grounded in optimisation theory.
First, we show that the learning dynamics of PC can be understood as an
approximate trust-region method using second-order information, despite
explicitly using only first-order local updates. Second, going beyond this
approximation, we show that PC can in principle make use of arbitrarily
higher-order information, such that for feedforward networks the effective
landscape on which PC learns is far more benign and robust to vanishing
gradients than the (mean squared error) loss landscape. Third, motivated by a
study of the inference dynamics of PCNs, we propose a new parameterisation
called ``$\mu$PC'', which for the first time allows stable training of 100+
layer networks with little tuning and competitive performance on simple tasks.
Overall, this thesis significantly advances our fundamental understanding of
the inference and learning dynamics of PCNs, while highlighting the need for
future research to focus on hardware co-design if PC is to compete with BP at
scale.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRAD是一种用于自动驾驶车辆传感器的实时异常检测方法，结合统计分析和深度学习，通过REMA自适应平滑因子和阈值检测异常，MS-SW技术捕获短长期模式，轻量级GRU模型检测分类异常，恢复模块修复受损数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保自动驾驶车辆传感器数据的可靠性，保证车辆安全运行，同时平衡高检测精度和低计算成本。

Method: 结合REMA（自适应平滑因子和阈值异常检测）、MS-SW（多级滑动窗口捕获短长期模式）、轻量级GRU模型（异常检测分类）和恢复模块（修复受损数据）。

Result: 异常数据F1-score达97.6%，正常数据F1-score达99.4%，能高精度分类不同异常类型，恢复模块准确修复受损数据，计算成本低。

Conclusion: GRAD在实时异常检测中表现出高精度和低计算成本的平衡，是自动驾驶系统中可靠高效的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces GRAD, a real-time anomaly detection method for
autonomous vehicle sensors that integrates statistical analysis and deep
learning to ensure the reliability of sensor data. The proposed approach
combines the Reinforced Exponential Moving Average (REMA), which adapts
smoothing factors and thresholding for outlier detection, with the Multi-Stage
Sliding Window (MS-SW) technique for capturing both short- and long-term
patterns. These features are processed using a lightweight Gated Recurrent Unit
(GRU) model, which detects and classifies anomalies based on bias types, while
a recovery module restores damaged sensor data to ensure continuous system
operation. GRAD has a lightweight architecture consisting of two layers of GRU
with a limited number of neurons that make it appropriate for real-time
applications while maintaining high detection accuracy. The GRAD framework
achieved remarkable performance in anomaly detection and classification. The
model demonstrated an overall F1-score of 97.6% for abnormal data and 99.4% for
normal data, signifying its high accuracy in distinguishing between normal and
anomalous sensor data. Regarding the anomaly classification, GRAD successfully
categorized different anomaly types with high precision, enabling the recovery
module to accurately restore damaged sensor data. Relative to analogous
studies, GRAD surpasses current models by attaining a balance between elevated
detection accuracy and diminished computational expense. These results
demonstrate GRAD's potential as a reliable and efficient solution for real-time
anomaly detection in autonomous vehicle systems, guaranteeing safe vehicle
operation with minimal computational overhead.

*Xinyu Wang,Jonas M. Kübler,Kailash Budhathoki,Yida Wang,Matthäus Kleindessner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种块对角LoRA方法，通过约束LoRA因子为块对角结构，实现了无需额外通信的LoRA适配器分片策略，显著提升了多设备设置下的推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在同时服务多个LoRA适配器时，S-LoRA方法存在通信开销问题，即使理论上开销很小，但在实践中可能很大。需要一种更高效的LoRA分片策略。

Method: 约束LoRA因子为块对角结构，从而允许一种替代的LoRA适配器分片方式，在LoRA计算中不需要任何额外的通信开销。

Result: 块对角LoRA在参数效率上与标准LoRA相当，但在端到端速度上显著优于S-LoRA。例如在8个A100 GPU上，Llama-3.1-70B实现了最高1.79倍加速，Llama-3.1-8B实现了最高1.63倍加速。

Conclusion: 块对角LoRA方法既保持了标准LoRA的参数效率，又通过消除通信开销实现了显著的端到端加速，是多适配器服务场景下的高效解决方案。

Abstract: When serving a single base LLM with several different LoRA adapters
simultaneously, the adapters cannot simply be merged with the base model's
weights as the adapter swapping would create overhead and requests using
different adapters could not be batched. Rather, the LoRA computations have to
be separated from the base LLM computations, and in a multi-device setup the
LoRA adapters can be sharded in a way that is well aligned with the base
model's tensor parallel execution, as proposed in S-LoRA. However, the S-LoRA
sharding strategy encounters some communication overhead, which may be small in
theory, but can be large in practice. In this paper, we propose to constrain
certain LoRA factors to be block-diagonal, which allows for an alternative way
of sharding LoRA adapters that does not require any additional communication
for the LoRA computations. We demonstrate in extensive experiments that our
block-diagonal LoRA approach is similarly parameter efficient as standard LoRA
(i.e., for a similar number of parameters it achieves similar downstream
performance) and that it leads to significant end-to-end speed-up over S-LoRA.
For example, when serving on eight A100 GPUs, we observe up to 1.79x (1.23x)
end-to-end speed-up with 0.87x (1.74x) the number of adapter parameters for
Llama-3.1-70B, and up to 1.63x (1.3x) end-to-end speed-up with 0.86x (1.73x)
the number of adapter parameters for Llama-3.1-8B.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了基于可学习Sigmoid算子的乘法更新近端梯度算法(SSO-PGA)，通过将传统的减法更新转换为乘法更新，在非负逆问题中实现鲁棒收敛和优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统近端梯度算法在图像重建等逆问题中经常违反非负约束，导致不稳定收敛和次优解，梯度下降步骤会引入负值并对超参数高度敏感。

Method: 用可学习的Sigmoid算子替代梯度下降步骤，将减法更新转换为乘法更新，强制非负性和有界性；添加滑动参数增强稳定性和收敛性；将优化算法展开为深度网络。

Result: 在数值和真实世界实验中，该方法显著超越传统PGA和其他最先进算法，确保优越性能和稳定性。

Conclusion: SSO-PGA通过创新的乘法更新机制有效解决了传统PGA的非负约束问题，结合了优化的可解释性和深度学习的强大能力。

Abstract: Proximal gradient algorithms (PGA), while foundational for inverse problems
like image reconstruction, often yield unstable convergence and suboptimal
solutions by violating the critical non-negativity constraint. We identify the
gradient descent step as the root cause of this issue, which introduces
negative values and induces high sensitivity to hyperparameters. To overcome
these limitations, we propose a novel multiplicative update proximal gradient
algorithm (SSO-PGA) with convergence guarantees, which is designed for
robustness in non-negative inverse problems. Our key innovation lies in
superseding the gradient descent step with a learnable sigmoid-based operator,
which inherently enforces non-negativity and boundedness by transforming
traditional subtractive updates into multiplicative ones. This design,
augmented by a sliding parameter for enhanced stability and convergence, not
only improves robustness but also boosts expressive capacity and noise
immunity. We further formulate a degradation model for multi-modal restoration
and derive its SSO-PGA-based optimization algorithm, which is then unfolded
into a deep network to marry the interpretability of optimization with the
power of deep learning. Extensive numerical and real-world experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly surpasses traditional PGA and other
state-of-the-art algorithms, ensuring superior performance and stability.

Conclusion: 基于基础模型的洪水易发性制图是洪水风险管理的可扩展且数据高效的可行解决方案。

Abstract: Flood susceptibility mapping (FSM) is vital for disaster prevention but
remains challenging in data-scarce regions where hydrodynamic models require
dense geophysical inputs. This work introduces ZeroFlood, a geospatial
foundation model framework for data-efficient FSM. The approach fine-tunes
Geospatial Foundation Models (GFMs) with Thinking-in-Modality (TiM) reasoning,
enabling flood prediction from basic Earth observation data such as Sentinel-1
or Sentinel-2 imagery. Using paired EO and simulated flood maps from data-rich
regions, ZeroFlood bridges data availability gaps through cross-modal
representation learning. Experiments with TerraMind and Prithvi GFMs show that
TiM enhances model robustness, with the TerraMind-Large configuration achieving
an F1 score of 67.21. The results demonstrate the feasibility of
foundation-model-based FSM as a scalable and data-efficient solution for flood
risk management.

Conclusion: GATE是一个即用型通用AI平台，无需特定问题重新配置即可应用于各种材料发现任务。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful accelerator of
materials discovery, yet most existing models remain problem-specific,
requiring additional data collection and retraining for each new property. Here
we introduce and validate GATE (Geometrically Aligned Transfer Encoder) -- a
generalizable AI framework that jointly learns 34 physicochemical properties
spanning thermal, electrical, mechanical, and optical domains. By aligning
these properties within a shared geometric space, GATE captures cross-property
correlations that reduce disjoint-property bias -- a key factor causing false
negatives in multi-criteria screening. To demonstrate its generalizability,
GATE -- without any problem-specific reconfiguration -- was directly applied to
the discovery of immersion cooling fluids for data centers, a stringent
real-world challenge defined by the Open Compute Project (OCP). Screening
billions of candidates, GATE identified 92,861 molecules as promising for
practical deployment. Four were experimentally or literarily validated, showing
strong agreement with wet-lab measurements and performance comparable to or
exceeding a commercial coolant. These results establish GATE as a ready-to-use,
generalizable AI platform readily applicable across diverse materials discovery
tasks.

Motivation: 探索一类相对未被充分研究的混合神经符号模型，结合符号学习和神经推理的优势，构建满足形式正确性标准的数据生成器。

Method: 符号学习者从少量实例中检查可行数据的逻辑规范，每个规范约束神经生成器的条件信息，拒绝违反符号规范的实例。结合受限归纳逻辑编程(ILP)与大型语言模型(LLM)实现SNG。

Result: 在基准药物设计问题上，SNG性能与最先进方法统计相当；在目标理解较差的探索性问题中，生成分子结合亲和力与领先临床候选药物相当；专家认为符号规范作为初步过滤器有用，多个生成分子被识别为可合成和湿实验室测试。

Conclusion: SNG成功整合了符号和神经方法的互补优势，在药物设计等应用中展示了实用价值，特别是在探索性场景中表现突出。

Abstract: We investigate a relatively underexplored class of hybrid neurosymbolic
models integrating symbolic learning with neural reasoning to construct data
generators meeting formal correctness criteria. In \textit{Symbolic Neural
Generators} (SNGs), symbolic learners examine logical specifications of
feasible data from a small set of instances -- sometimes just one. Each
specification in turn constrains the conditional information supplied to a
neural-based generator, which rejects any instance violating the symbolic
specification. Like other neurosymbolic approaches, SNG exploits the
complementary strengths of symbolic and neural methods. The outcome of an SNG
is a triple $(H, X, W)$, where $H$ is a symbolic description of feasible
instances constructed from data, $X$ a set of generated new instances that
satisfy the description, and $W$ an associated weight. We introduce a semantics
for such systems, based on the construction of appropriate \textit{base} and
\textit{fibre} partially-ordered sets combined into an overall partial order,
and outline a probabilistic extension relevant to practical applications. In
this extension, SNGs result from searching over a weighted partial ordering. We
implement an SNG combining a restricted form of Inductive Logic Programming
(ILP) with a large language model (LLM) and evaluate it on early-stage drug
design. Our main interest is the description and the set of potential inhibitor
molecules generated by the SNG. On benchmark problems -- where drug targets are
well understood -- SNG performance is statistically comparable to
state-of-the-art methods. On exploratory problems with poorly understood
targets, generated molecules exhibit binding affinities on par with leading
clinical candidates. Experts further find the symbolic specifications useful as
preliminary filters, with several generated molecules identified as viable for
synthesis and wet-lab testing.

Motivation: RLVR在数学和编程领域虽然提升了推理能力，但强化学习微调过程会损害模型的探索能力，导致生成多样性下降，进而在Best-of-N采样中性能退化。

Method: 推导了max@k指标的无偏on-policy梯度估计，并将其扩展到off-policy更新，以提高样本效率。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在off-policy场景下有效优化了max@k指标，使模型与Best-of-N推理策略保持一致。

Conclusion: 提出的目标函数能够有效优化max@k指标，解决了RLVR微调导致的多样性问题，提升了Best-of-N采样的性能。

Abstract: The application of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to
mathematical and coding domains has demonstrated significant improvements in
the reasoning and problem-solving abilities of Large Language Models. Despite
its success in single generation problem solving, the reinforcement learning
fine-tuning process may harm the model's exploration ability, as reflected in
decreased diversity of generations and a resulting degradation of performance
during Best-of-N sampling for large N values. In this work, we focus on
optimizing the max@k metric, a continuous generalization of pass@k. We derive
an unbiased on-policy gradient estimate for direct optimization of this metric.
Furthermore, we extend our derivations to the off-policy updates, a common
element in modern RLVR algorithms, that allows better sample efficiency.
Empirically, we show that our objective effectively optimizes max@k metric in
off-policy scenarios, aligning the model with the Best-of-N inference strategy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Eigen-Value (EV)框架，一种用于OOD鲁棒性的即插即用数据估值方法，仅使用ID数据子集，通过谱近似估计领域差异，无需额外训练循环。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据估值方法主要基于ID损失，无法泛化到OOD场景，而现有的OOD感知方法计算成本高昂，阻碍实际部署。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上，EV实现了改进的OOD鲁棒性和稳定的价值排名，同时保持计算轻量级。

Conclusion: EV为具有领域偏移的大规模场景提供了一种高效的OOD鲁棒数据估值路径。

Abstract: Data valuation has become central in the era of data-centric AI. It drives
efficient training pipelines and enables objective pricing in data markets by
assigning a numeric value to each data point. Most existing data valuation
methods estimate the effect of removing individual data points by evaluating
changes in model validation performance under in-distribution (ID) settings, as
opposed to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios where data follow different
patterns. Since ID and OOD data behave differently, data valuation methods
based on ID loss often fail to generalize to OOD settings, particularly when
the validation set contains no OOD data. Furthermore, although OOD-aware
methods exist, they involve heavy computational costs, which hinder practical
deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce \emph{Eigen-Value} (EV),
a plug-and-play data valuation framework for OOD robustness that uses only an
ID data subset, including during validation. EV provides a new spectral
approximation of domain discrepancy, which is the gap of loss between ID and
OOD using ratios of eigenvalues of ID data's covariance matrix. EV then
estimates the marginal contribution of each data point to this discrepancy via
perturbation theory, alleviating the computational burden. Subsequently, EV
plugs into ID loss-based methods by adding an EV term without any additional
training loop. We demonstrate that EV achieves improved OOD robustness and
stable value rankings across real-world datasets, while remaining
computationally lightweight. These results indicate that EV is practical for
large-scale settings with domain shift, offering an efficient path to
OOD-robust data valuation.

Abstract: We explore a "best-of-both" approach to modelling molecular properties by

general-purpose descriptors and a mixed ensemble of machine learning (ML)
models. We introduce a MetaModel framework to aggregate predictions from a
diverse set of leading ML models. We present a featurisation scheme for
combining task-specific GNN-derived features with conventional molecular

  We demonstrate that our framework outperforms the cutting-edge ChemProp model
on all regression datasets tested and 6 of 9 classification datasets. We
further show that including the GNN features derived from ChemProp boosts the
ensemble model's performance on several datasets where it otherwise would have
underperformed. We conclude that to achieve optimal performance across a wide
set of problems, it is vital to combine general-purpose descriptors with
task-specific learned features and use a diverse set of ML models to make the
predictions.

Conclusion: 提出的新误差度量方法能有效处理噪声污染数据集的核心集构建问题，在理论和实践中都表现出优于传统方法的性能。

Abstract: We study the problem of constructing coresets for $(k, z)$-clustering when
the input dataset is corrupted by stochastic noise drawn from a known
distribution. In this setting, evaluating the quality of a coreset is
inherently challenging, as the true underlying dataset is unobserved. To
address this, we investigate coreset construction using surrogate error metrics
that are tractable and provably related to the true clustering cost. We analyze
a traditional metric from prior work and introduce a new error metric that more
closely aligns with the true cost. Although our metric is defined independently
of the noise distribution, it enables approximation guarantees that scale with
the noise level. We design a coreset construction algorithm based on this
metric and show that, under mild assumptions on the data and noise, enforcing
an $\varepsilon$-bound under our metric yields smaller coresets and tighter
guarantees on the true clustering cost than those obtained via classical
metrics. In particular, we prove that the coreset size can improve by a factor
of up to $\mathrm{poly}(k)$, where $n$ is the dataset size. Experiments on
real-world datasets support our theoretical findings and demonstrate the
practical advantages of our approach.

Abstract: In this work, we study out-of-distribution generalization in meta-learning
from an information-theoretic perspective. We focus on two scenarios: (i) when
the testing environment mismatches the training environment, and (ii) when the
training environment is broader than the testing environment. The first
corresponds to the standard distribution mismatch setting, while the second
reflects a broad-to-narrow training scenario. We further formalize the
generalization problem in meta-reinforcement learning and establish
corresponding generalization bounds. Finally, we analyze the generalization
performance of a gradient-based meta-reinforcement learning algorithm.

Abstract: We introduce the Schrodinger Neural Network (SNN), a principled architecture
for conditional density estimation and uncertainty quantification inspired by

departs from standard parametric likelihood heads by learning complex
coefficients of a spectral expansion (e . g ., Chebyshev polynomials) whose
squared modulus yields the conditional density $p(y|x)=\left| \psi _x(y)\right|
{}^2$ with analytic normalization. This representation confers three practical
advantages: positivity and exact normalization by construction, native
multimodality through interference among basis modes without explicit mixture
bookkeeping, and yields closed-form (or efficiently computable)
functionals$-$such as moments and several calibration diagnostics$-$as
quadratic forms in coefficient space. We develop the statistical and
computational foundations of the SNN, including (i) training by exact
maximum-likelihood with unit-sphere coefficient parameterization, (ii)
physics-inspired quadratic regularizers (kinetic and potential energies)
motivated by uncertainty relations between localization and spectral
complexity, (iii) scalable low-rank and separable extensions for multivariate
outputs, (iv) operator-based extensions that represent observables,
constraints, and weak labels as self-adjoint matrices acting on the amplitude
space, and (v) a comprehensive framework for evaluating multimodal predictions.
The SNN provides a coherent, tractable framework to elevate probabilistic
prediction from point estimates to physically inspired amplitude-based
distributions.

*Khoa Nguyen,Khang Tran,NhatHai Phan,Cristian Borcea,Rouming Jin,Issa Khalil*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SGFusion是一种利用移动用户地理信息的联邦学习训练算法，通过将数据映射到地理区域并为每个区域训练一个FL模型，使用分层随机图建模区域间相关性，通过随机梯度融合实现知识共享。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用移动用户的地理信息来改进联邦学习，使模型能够更好地适应不同地理区域用户的数据和行为特征。

Method: 将移动设备收集的数据映射到地理区域，为每个区域训练一个FL模型；使用分层随机图建模区域间的本地数据相关性；通过马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛采样优化HRG；每个训练步骤中，区域将本地梯度与从HRG采样的其他区域梯度进行融合。

Result: 在6个国家收集的心率预测数据集上，SGFusion训练的模型以有界期望误差收敛，在所有国家都显著提高了模型效用，且没有显著影响系统可扩展性。

Conclusion: SGFusion通过地理梯度融合显著提高了模型效用，同时保持了计算效率，为利用地理信息的联邦学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes Stochastic Geographic Gradient Fusion (SGFusion), a novel
training algorithm to leverage the geographic information of mobile users in
Federated Learning (FL). SGFusion maps the data collected by mobile devices
onto geographical zones and trains one FL model per zone, which adapts well to
the data and behaviors of users in that zone. SGFusion models the local
data-based correlation among geographical zones as a hierarchical random graph
(HRG) optimized by Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling. At each training step,
every zone fuses its local gradient with gradients derived from a small set of
other zones sampled from the HRG. This approach enables knowledge fusion and
sharing among geographical zones in a probabilistic and stochastic gradient
fusion process with self-attention weights, such that "more similar" zones have
"higher probabilities" of sharing gradients with "larger attention weights."
SGFusion remarkably improves model utility without introducing undue
computational cost. Extensive theoretical and empirical results using a
heart-rate prediction dataset collected across 6 countries show that models
trained with SGFusion converge with upper-bounded expected errors and
significantly improve utility in all countries compared to existing approaches
without notable cost in system scalability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了空中联邦学习(AirFL)中的差分隐私保护问题，证明了在多天线基站的多接入衰落信道中，即使不注入人工噪声也能实现用户级差分隐私保护。

Conclusion: 理论发现通过大量数值结果得到验证，表明在特定条件下可以利用信道噪声实现收敛的差分隐私保护，而无需额外的人工噪声注入。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that preserves
privacy by eliminating the need to exchange raw data during training. In its
prototypical edge instantiation with underlying wireless transmissions enabled
by analog over-the-air computing (AirComp), referred to as \emph{over-the-air
FL (AirFL)}, the inherent channel noise plays a unique role of \emph{frenemy}
in the sense that it degrades training due to noisy global aggregation while
providing a natural source of randomness for privacy-preserving mechanisms,
formally quantified by \emph{differential privacy (DP)}. It remains,
nevertheless, challenging to effectively harness such channel impairments, as
prior arts, under assumptions of either simple channel models or restricted
types of loss functions, mostly considering (local) DP enhancement with a
single-round or non-convergent bound on privacy loss. In this paper, we study
AirFL over multiple-access fading channels with a multi-antenna base station
(BS) subject to user-level DP requirements. Despite a recent study, which
claimed in similar settings that artificial noise (AN) must be injected to
ensure DP in general, we demonstrate, on the contrary, that DP can be gained as
a \emph{perk} even \emph{without} employing any AN. Specifically, we derive a
novel bound on DP that converges under general bounded-domain assumptions on
model parameters, along with a convergence bound with general smooth and
non-convex loss functions. Next, we optimize over receive beamforming and power
allocations to characterize the optimal convergence-privacy trade-offs, which
also reveal explicit conditions in which DP is achievable without compromising
training. Finally, our theoretical findings are validated by extensive
numerical results.

Motivation: 现有图提示方法主要关注模型效用，忽视了预训练GNN模型在下游任务中可能产生的跨人口亚组的歧视性表示问题

Method: 设计自适应特征校正模块学习定制化属性提示来抑制敏感信息；提出自适应消息校准模块在每层生成结构提示来调整邻居节点消息；联合优化两个提示模块

Result: 在四个数据集和四种预训练策略上的实验表明，ADPrompt在节点分类任务上优于七个基线方法

Conclusion: ADPrompt框架有效解决了图提示中的公平性问题，通过双重自适应提示机制在保持模型性能的同时增强公平性

Abstract: In recent years, pre-training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) through
self-supervised learning on unlabeled graph data has emerged as a widely
adopted paradigm in graph learning. Although the paradigm is effective for
pre-training powerful GNN models, the objective gap often exists between
pre-training and downstream tasks. To bridge this gap, graph prompting adapts
pre-trained GNN models to specific downstream tasks with extra learnable
prompts while keeping the pre-trained GNN models frozen. As recent graph
prompting methods largely focus on enhancing model utility on downstream tasks,
they often overlook fairness concerns when designing prompts for adaptation. In
fact, pre-trained GNN models will produce discriminative node representations
across demographic subgroups, as downstream graph data inherently contains
biases in both node attributes and graph structures. To address this issue, we
propose an Adaptive Dual Prompting (ADPrompt) framework that enhances fairness
for adapting pre-trained GNN models to downstream tasks. To mitigate attribute
bias, we design an Adaptive Feature Rectification module that learns customized
attribute prompts to suppress sensitive information at the input layer,
reducing bias at the source. Afterward, we propose an Adaptive Message
Calibration module that generates structure prompts at each layer, which adjust
the message from neighboring nodes to enable dynamic and soft calibration of
the information flow. Finally, ADPrompt jointly optimizes the two prompting
modules to adapt the pre-trained GNN while enhancing fairness. We conduct
extensive experiments on four datasets with four pre-training strategies to
evaluate the performance of ADPrompt. The results demonstrate that our proposed
ADPrompt outperforms seven baseline methods on node classification tasks.

Motivation: 芯片布局对芯片设计质量至关重要，但缺乏统一的BBO专用基准来全面评估各种问题表述和算法。

Method: 开发了模块化、解耦且灵活的框架，集成了三种BBO芯片布局问题表述（掩模引导优化、超参数优化、序列对问题）和多种算法（模拟退火、进化算法、贝叶斯优化）。

Result: 实验显示掩模引导优化和超参数优化比序列对问题表现更好，进化算法在高维搜索空间中优于模拟退火和贝叶斯优化，并达到主流芯片布局方法的最先进性能。

Conclusion: BBOPlace-Bench不仅促进了芯片布局高效BBO解决方案的开发，还为BBO社区拓宽了实际应用场景。

Abstract: Chip placement is a vital stage in modern chip design as it has a substantial
impact on the subsequent processes and the overall quality of the final chip.
The use of black-box optimization (BBO) for chip placement has a history of
several decades. However, early efforts were limited by immature problem
formulations and inefficient algorithm designs. Recent progress has shown the
effectiveness and efficiency of BBO for chip placement, proving its potential
to achieve state-of-the-art results. Despite these advancements, the field
lacks a unified, BBO-specific benchmark for thoroughly assessing various
problem formulations and BBO algorithms. To fill this gap, we propose
BBOPlace-Bench, the first benchmark designed specifically for evaluating and
developing BBO algorithms for chip placement tasks. It integrates three problem
formulations of BBO for chip placement, and offers a modular, decoupled, and
flexible framework that enables users to seamlessly implement, test, and
compare their own algorithms. BBOPlace-Bench integrates a wide variety of
existing BBO algorithms, including simulated annealing (SA), evolutionary
algorithms (EAs), and Bayesian optimization (BO). Experimental results show
that the problem formulations of mask-guided optimization and hyperparameter
optimization exhibit superior performance than the sequence pair problem
formulation, while EAs demonstrate better overall performance than SA and BO,
especially in high-dimensional search spaces, and also achieve state-of-the-art
performance compared to the mainstream chip placement methods. BBOPlace-Bench
not only facilitates the development of efficient BBO-driven solutions for chip
placement but also broadens the practical application scenarios (which are
urgently needed) for the BBO community. The code of BBOPlace-Bench is available
at https://github.com/lamda-bbo/BBOPlace-Bench.

Method: 提出T-REGS框架，利用学习表示的最小生成树长度作为正则化项，在任意紧致黎曼流形上同时缓解维度坍缩和促进分布均匀性

Result: 在合成数据和经典SSL基准测试上的实验验证了该方法在提升表示质量方面的有效性

Conclusion: T-REGS是一个简单有效的正则化框架，能够同时解决自监督学习中的维度坍缩和分布不均匀问题

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
learning representations without labeled data, often by enforcing invariance to
input transformations such as rotations or blurring. Recent studies have
highlighted two pivotal properties for effective representations: (i) avoiding
dimensional collapse-where the learned features occupy only a low-dimensional
subspace, and (ii) enhancing uniformity of the induced distribution. In this
work, we introduce T-REGS, a simple regularization framework for SSL based on
the length of the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) over the learned representation.
We provide theoretical analysis demonstrating that T-REGS simultaneously
mitigates dimensional collapse and promotes distribution uniformity on
arbitrary compact Riemannian manifolds. Several experiments on synthetic data
and on classical SSL benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach at
enhancing representation quality.

analyzing Blackwell optimality in restricted policy classes, we encourage
concise yet accurate reasoning. Experiments confirm our theoretical results

Conclusion: 该混合精度训练框架为神经ODE提供了一种可靠且高效的训练方案，解决了计算成本和内存需求的关键挑战，并提供了开源PyTorch包rampde。

Abstract: Exploiting low-precision computations has become a standard strategy in deep
learning to address the growing computational costs imposed by ever larger
models and datasets. However, naively performing all computations in low
precision can lead to roundoff errors and instabilities. Therefore, mixed
precision training schemes usually store the weights in high precision and use
low-precision computations only for whitelisted operations. Despite their
success, these principles are currently not reliable for training
continuous-time architectures such as neural ordinary differential equations
(Neural ODEs). This paper presents a mixed precision training framework for
neural ODEs, combining explicit ODE solvers with a custom backpropagation
scheme, and demonstrates its effectiveness across a range of learning tasks.
Our scheme uses low-precision computations for evaluating the velocity,
parameterized by the neural network, and for storing intermediate states, while
stability is provided by a custom dynamic adjoint scaling and by accumulating
the solution and gradients in higher precision. These contributions address two
key challenges in training neural ODE: the computational cost of repeated
network evaluations and the growth of memory requirements with the number of
time steps or layers. Along with the paper, we publish our extendable,
open-source PyTorch package rampde, whose syntax resembles that of leading
packages to provide a drop-in replacement in existing codes. We demonstrate the
reliability and effectiveness of our scheme using challenging test cases and on
neural ODE applications in image classification and generative models,
achieving approximately 50% memory reduction and up to 2x speedup while
maintaining accuracy comparable to single-precision training.

Method: 提出了基础不可知的Glorot-like初始化方案来保持激活方差，并设计了残差门控自适应KANs（RGA KANs）架构来缓解深层网络的发散问题。

Result: 在7个标准前向PDE基准测试中，RGA KANs在稳定性和精度上显著优于参数匹配的cPIKANs和PirateNets，通常高出几个数量级。

Conclusion: RGA KANs成功解决了深度cPIKANs的训练不稳定问题，在多种PDE设置下保持稳定并实现卓越性能。

Abstract: Since their introduction, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have been
successfully applied across several domains, with physics-informed machine
learning (PIML) emerging as one of the areas where they have thrived. In the
PIML setting, Chebyshev-based physics-informed KANs (cPIKANs) have become the
standard due to their computational efficiency. However, like their multilayer
perceptron-based counterparts, cPIKANs face significant challenges when scaled
to depth, leading to training instabilities that limit their applicability to
several PDE problems. To address this, we propose a basis-agnostic, Glorot-like
initialization scheme that preserves activation variance and yields substantial
improvements in stability and accuracy over the default initialization of
cPIKANs. Inspired by the PirateNet architecture, we further introduce
Residual-Gated Adaptive KANs (RGA KANs), designed to mitigate divergence in
deep cPIKANs where initialization alone is not sufficient. Through empirical
tests and information bottleneck analysis, we show that RGA KANs successfully
traverse all training phases, unlike baseline cPIKANs, which stagnate in the
diffusion phase in specific PDE settings. Evaluations on seven standard forward
PDE benchmarks under a fixed training pipeline with adaptive components
demonstrate that RGA KANs consistently outperform parameter-matched cPIKANs and
PirateNets - often by several orders of magnitude - while remaining stable in
settings where the others diverge.

Conclusion: DFNMF提供了一种可扩展、可解释的端到端公平图聚类解决方案，通过单一参数有效平衡公平性与效用性。

Abstract: Fair graph clustering seeks partitions that respect network structure while
maintaining proportional representation across sensitive groups, with
applications spanning community detection, team formation, resource allocation,
and social network analysis. Many existing approaches enforce rigid constraints
or rely on multi-stage pipelines (e.g., spectral embedding followed by
$k$-means), limiting trade-off control, interpretability, and scalability. We
introduce \emph{DFNMF}, an end-to-end deep nonnegative tri-factorization
tailored to graphs that directly optimizes cluster assignments with a soft
statistical-parity regularizer. A single parameter $\lambda$ tunes the
fairness--utility balance, while nonnegativity yields parts-based factors and
transparent soft memberships. The optimization uses sparse-friendly alternating
updates and scales near-linearly with the number of edges. Across synthetic and
real networks, DFNMF achieves substantially higher group balance at comparable
modularity, often dominating state-of-the-art baselines on the Pareto front.

Result: 从合成函数到多目标优化算法配置的实验表明，Seq-MADAC优于最先进的多智能体强化学习方法，并在问题类别间表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: Seq-MADAC为广泛依赖感知的自动化算法配置建立了新范式。

Abstract: Dynamic algorithm configuration (DAC) is a recent trend in automated machine
learning, which can dynamically adjust the algorithm's configuration during the
execution process and relieve users from tedious trial-and-error tuning tasks.
Recently, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches have improved
the configuration of multiple heterogeneous hyperparameters, making various
parameter configurations for complex algorithms possible. However, many complex
algorithms have inherent inter-dependencies among multiple parameters (e.g.,
determining the operator type first and then the operator's parameter), which
are, however, not considered in previous approaches, thus leading to
sub-optimal results. In this paper, we propose the sequential multi-agent DAC
(Seq-MADAC) framework to address this issue by considering the inherent
inter-dependencies of multiple parameters. Specifically, we propose a
sequential advantage decomposition network, which can leverage action-order
information through sequential advantage decomposition. Experiments from
synthetic functions to the configuration of multi-objective optimization
algorithms demonstrate Seq-MADAC's superior performance over state-of-the-art
MARL methods and show strong generalization across problem classes. Seq-MADAC
establishes a new paradigm for the widespread dependency-aware automated
algorithm configuration. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出TAMI框架解决时序图链接预测中的异质性问题，通过LTE和LHA组件改进时间信息编码和防止历史交互遗忘，显著提升现有模型的预测性能。


<details>

Motivation: 时序交互中天然存在异质性，如少数节点对产生大部分交互事件、交互间隔时间不均等，导致现有方法在编码时间信息和处理间歇性交互时效果不佳，特别是对不频繁交互节点对的链接预测。

Method: 提出TAMI框架，包含两个核心组件：对数时间编码函数(LTE)将交互间隔转换为更平衡的分布，链接历史聚合(LHA)防止目标节点对的历史交互被遗忘。该框架可无缝集成到现有最先进的时序图神经网络中。

Result: 在13个经典数据集和3个最新TGB基准数据集上的实验表明，TAMI在转导和归纳设置下都能持续提升底层模型的链接预测性能。

Conclusion: TAMI框架通过有效处理时序交互的异质性，显著改进了时序图链接预测的性能，特别是对于不频繁交互节点对的预测效果。

Abstract: Temporal graph link prediction aims to predict future interactions between
nodes in a graph based on their historical interactions, which are encoded in
node embeddings. We observe that heterogeneity naturally appears in temporal
interactions, e.g., a few node pairs can make most interaction events, and
interaction events happen at varying intervals. This leads to the problems of
ineffective temporal information encoding and forgetting of past interactions
for a pair of nodes that interact intermittently for their link prediction.
Existing methods, however, do not consider such heterogeneity in their learning
process, and thus their learned temporal node embeddings are less effective,
especially when predicting the links for infrequently interacting node pairs.
To cope with the heterogeneity, we propose a novel framework called TAMI, which
contains two effective components, namely log time encoding function (LTE) and
link history aggregation (LHA). LTE better encodes the temporal information
through transforming interaction intervals into more balanced ones, and LHA
prevents the historical interactions for each target node pair from being
forgotten. State-of-the-art temporal graph neural networks can be seamlessly
and readily integrated into TAMI to improve their effectiveness. Experiment
results on 13 classic datasets and three newest temporal graph benchmark (TGB)
datasets show that TAMI consistently improves the link prediction performance
of the underlying models in both transductive and inductive settings. Our code
is available at https://github.com/Alleinx/TAMI_temporal_graph.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPO方法虽然简单稳定，但对数据噪声敏感且容易过拟合。现有的DRO方法存在过度保守和计算成本高的问题，需要一种更高效的鲁棒优化方案。

Method: 基于DPO框架，引入轻量级DRO公式处理偏好分布的不确定性，仅关注偏好不确定性，避免不必要的保守性，计算开销可忽略不计。

Result: 在标准对齐基准和真实公共卫生任务上的实验表明，DPO-PRO相比现有DPO变体能持续提升对噪声偏好信号的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DPO-PRO是一种有效的鲁棒微调算法，通过正则化DPO目标惩罚模型在弱偏好信号下的过度自信，实现了更好的噪声鲁棒性。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a popular method for
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) due to its stability and simplicity.
However, it is also known to be sensitive to noise in the data and prone to
overfitting. Recent works have proposed using distributionally robust
optimization (DRO) to address potential noise and distributional shift in the
data. However, these methods often suffer from excessive conservatism and high
computational cost. We propose DPO-PRO (DPO with Preference Robustness), a
robust fine-tuning algorithm based on DPO which accounts for uncertainty in the
preference distribution through a lightweight DRO formulation. Unlike prior
DRO-based variants, DPO-PRO focuses solely on uncertainty in preferences,
avoiding unnecessary conservatism and incurring negligible computational
overhead. We further show that DPO-PRO is equivalent to a regularized DPO
objective that penalizes model overconfidence under weak preference signals. We
evaluate DPO-PRO on standard alignment benchmarks and a real-world public
health task. Experimental results show that our method consistently improves
robustness to noisy preference signals compared to existing DPO variants.

Motivation: 传统角色动画技术难以处理任意情境，现有方法需要手动设置或缺乏动作捕捉的自然性，且人群动画中身体动画与轨迹规划常分离导致不一致。

Method: 预处理阶段从动作捕捉数据库提取形状、姿态和轨迹特征；运行时执行高效搜索，匹配用户输入和当前姿态，同时惩罚与动态环境的碰撞。

Result: 角色能够自然地调整姿态和轨迹以导航拥挤场景。

Conclusion: 环境感知运动匹配系统解决了现有方法的局限性，实现了更自然的角色动画和人群行为。

Abstract: Interactive applications demand believable characters that respond naturally
to dynamic environments. Traditional character animation techniques often
struggle to handle arbitrary situations, leading to a growing trend of
dynamically selecting motion-captured animations based on predefined features.
While Motion Matching has proven effective for locomotion by aligning to target
trajectories, animating environment interactions and crowd behaviors remains
challenging due to the need to consider surrounding elements. Existing
approaches often involve manual setup or lack the naturalism of motion capture.
Furthermore, in crowd animation, body animation is frequently treated as a
separate process from trajectory planning, leading to inconsistencies between
body pose and root motion. To address these limitations, we present
Environment-aware Motion Matching, a novel real-time system for full-body
character animation that dynamically adapts to obstacles and other agents,
emphasizing the bidirectional relationship between pose and trajectory. In a
preprocessing step, we extract shape, pose, and trajectory features from a
motion capture database. At runtime, we perform an efficient search that
matches user input and current pose while penalizing collisions with a dynamic
environment. Our method allows characters to naturally adjust their pose and
trajectory to navigate crowded scenes.

Result: 方法在多种实验中被证明有效，适用于从简单行走、慢跑到侧向移动、踮脚行走、轻微蹲姿或跳舞等多样化运动风格。

Conclusion: Step2Motion填补了利用鞋垫传感器进行运动重建的研究空白，为无约束运动捕捉提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Human motion is fundamentally driven by continuous physical interaction with
the environment. Whether walking, running, or simply standing, the forces
exchanged between our feet and the ground provide crucial insights for
understanding and reconstructing human movement. Recent advances in wearable
insole devices offer a compelling solution for capturing these forces in
diverse, real-world scenarios. Sensor insoles pose no constraint on the users'
motion (unlike mocap suits) and are unaffected by line-of-sight limitations (in
contrast to optical systems). These qualities make sensor insoles an ideal
choice for robust, unconstrained motion capture, particularly in outdoor
environments. Surprisingly, leveraging these devices with recent motion
reconstruction methods remains largely unexplored. Aiming to fill this gap, we
present Step2Motion, the first approach to reconstruct human locomotion from
multi-modal insole sensors. Our method utilizes pressure and inertial
data-accelerations and angular rates-captured by the insoles to reconstruct
human motion. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach across a range of
experiments to show its versatility for diverse locomotion styles, from simple
ones like walking or jogging up to moving sideways, on tiptoes, slightly
crouching, or dancing.

Abstract: We present FlowCapX, a physics-enhanced framework for flow reconstruction
from sparse video inputs, addressing the challenge of jointly optimizing
complex physical constraints and sparse observational data over long time
horizons. Existing methods often struggle to capture turbulent motion while
maintaining physical consistency, limiting reconstruction quality and
downstream tasks. Focusing on velocity inference, our approach introduces a
hybrid framework that strategically separates representation and supervision
across spatial scales. At the coarse level, we resolve sparse-view ambiguities
via a novel optimization strategy that aligns long-term observation with
physics-grounded velocity fields. By emphasizing vorticity-based physical
constraints, our method enhances physical fidelity and improves optimization
stability. At the fine level, we prioritize observational fidelity to preserve
critical turbulent structures. Extensive experiments demonstrate
state-of-the-art velocity reconstruction, enabling velocity-aware downstream
tasks, e.g., accurate flow analysis, scene augmentation with tracer
visualization and re-simulation.
