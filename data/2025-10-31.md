### [1] [Enhancing Underwater Object Detection through Spatio-Temporal Analysis and Spatial Attention Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25797)
*Sai Likhith Karri,Ansh Saxena*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究评估了时空建模和空间注意力机制在深度学习模型中对水下目标检测的有效性。通过比较标准YOLOv5、时间增强的T-YOLOv5以及添加CBAM模块的T-YOLOv5，发现时空建模显著提升了动态海洋环境中的检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是解决水下目标检测在动态海洋环境中面临的挑战，包括突然运动、部分遮挡和渐变运动等复杂条件，探索如何通过时空建模和注意力机制来提高检测性能。

Method: 研究分为两个阶段：第一阶段评估时间增强的T-YOLOv5与标准YOLOv5的性能对比；第二阶段开发了添加卷积块注意力模块(CBAM)的T-YOLOv5增强版本。通过比较这三种模型在水下目标检测任务中的表现。

Result: 测试结果显示：标准YOLOv5的mAP@50-95为0.563，而T-YOLOv5和T-YOLOv5+CBAM分别达到0.813和0.811，显著优于标准模型。T-YOLOv5+CBAM在复杂场景中表现更好，但在简单场景中精度有所损失。

Conclusion: 时空建模显著提高了水下目标检测的可靠性，T-YOLOv5相比标准模型有显著改进，而添加CBAM的版本在挑战性场景中表现更优，尽管在简单场景中精度有所下降。

Abstract: This study examines the effectiveness of spatio-temporal modeling and the
integration of spatial attention mechanisms in deep learning models for
underwater object detection. Specifically, in the first phase, the performance
of temporal-enhanced YOLOv5 variant T-YOLOv5 is evaluated, in comparison with
the standard YOLOv5. For the second phase, an augmented version of T-YOLOv5 is
developed, through the addition of a Convolutional Block Attention Module
(CBAM). By examining the effectiveness of the already pre-existing YOLOv5 and
T-YOLOv5 models and of the newly developed T-YOLOv5 with CBAM. With CBAM, the
research highlights how temporal modeling improves detection accuracy in
dynamic marine environments, particularly under conditions of sudden movements,
partial occlusions, and gradual motion. The testing results showed that YOLOv5
achieved a mAP@50-95 of 0.563, while T-YOLOv5 and T-YOLOv5 with CBAM
outperformed with mAP@50-95 scores of 0.813 and 0.811, respectively,
highlighting their superior accuracy and generalization in detecting complex
objects. The findings demonstrate that T-YOLOv5 significantly enhances
detection reliability compared to the standard model, while T-YOLOv5 with CBAM
further improves performance in challenging scenarios, although there is a loss
of accuracy when it comes to simpler scenarios.

### [2] [MIRO: MultI-Reward cOnditioned pretraining improves T2I quality and efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25897)
*Nicolas Dufour,Lucas Degeorge,Arijit Ghosh,Vicky Kalogeiton,David Picard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIRO方法通过在训练过程中直接让模型学习多个奖励模型的条件，而不是事后选择生成的图像，从而显著提高了生成图像的视觉质量并加速了训练过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像生成模型在大型未筛选数据集上训练以实现多样化生成能力，但这与用户偏好不一致。现有的奖励模型通过事后选择图像来对齐奖励，但这会损害多样性、语义保真度和效率。

Method: 提出MIRO方法，在训练过程中让模型基于多个奖励模型进行条件化学习，直接学习用户偏好，而不是事后处理。

Result: MIRO在GenEval组合基准和用户偏好评分（PickAScore、ImageReward、HPSv2）上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过在训练中直接学习多个奖励模型的条件，MIRO方法不仅大幅提升了生成图像的视觉质量，还显著加快了训练速度，避免了事后处理带来的问题。

Abstract: Current text-to-image generative models are trained on large uncurated
datasets to enable diverse generation capabilities. However, this does not
align well with user preferences. Recently, reward models have been
specifically designed to perform post-hoc selection of generated images and
align them to a reward, typically user preference. This discarding of
informative data together with the optimizing for a single reward tend to harm
diversity, semantic fidelity and efficiency. Instead of this post-processing,
we propose to condition the model on multiple reward models during training to
let the model learn user preferences directly. We show that this not only
dramatically improves the visual quality of the generated images but it also
significantly speeds up the training. Our proposed method, called MIRO,
achieves state-of-the-art performances on the GenEval compositional benchmark
and user-preference scores (PickAScore, ImageReward, HPSv2).

Abstract: The vulnerability of cyclists, exacerbated by the rising popularity of faster
e-bikes, motivates adapting automotive perception technologies for bicycle
safety. We use our multi-sensor 'SenseBike' research platform to develop and
evaluate a 3D LiDAR segmentation approach tailored to bicycles. To bridge the
automotive-to-bicycle domain gap, we introduce the novel BikeScenes-lidarseg
Dataset, comprising 3021 consecutive LiDAR scans around the university campus
of the TU Delft, semantically annotated for 29 dynamic and static classes. By
evaluating model performance, we demonstrate that fine-tuning on our BikeScenes
dataset achieves a mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) of 63.6%, significantly
outperforming the 13.8% obtained with SemanticKITTI pre-training alone. This
result underscores the necessity and effectiveness of domain-specific training.
We highlight key challenges specific to bicycle-mounted, hardware-constrained
perception systems and contribute the BikeScenes dataset as a resource for
advancing research in cyclist-centric LiDAR segmentation.

### [4] [Generative Image Restoration and Super-Resolution using Physics-Informed Synthetic Data for Scanning Tunneling Microscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25921)
*Nikola L. Kolev,Tommaso Rodani,Neil J. Curson,Taylor J. Z. Stock,Alberto Cazzaniga*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于机器学习的STM图像修复和超分辨率方法，使用少量实验图像和物理信息合成数据训练模型，显著提升图像质量和采集效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决STM技术中针尖退化和数据采集速度慢的限制，减少针尖调节频率并提高实验吞吐量

Method: 使用36张Si(001):H实验图像，通过物理信息合成数据生成管道训练流匹配和扩散模型，实现图像修复和超分辨率重建

Result: 模型有效恢复图像质量，通过稀疏采样数据实现2-4倍的图像采集时间减少，CLIP最大均值差异和结构相似性指标验证了性能

Conclusion: 该框架有潜力显著提高STM实验吞吐量，减少针尖调节频率并增强现有高速STM系统的帧率

Abstract: Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) enables atomic-resolution imaging and
atom manipulation, but its utility is often limited by tip degradation and slow
serial data acquisition. Fabrication adds another layer of complexity since the
tip is often subjected to large voltages, which may alter the shape of its
apex, requiring it to be conditioned. Here, we propose a machine learning (ML)
approach for image repair and super-resolution to alleviate both challenges.
Using a dataset of only 36 pristine experimental images of Si(001):H, we
demonstrate that a physics-informed synthetic data generation pipeline can be
used to train several state-of-the-art flow-matching and diffusion models.
Quantitative evaluation with metrics such as the CLIP Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(CMMD) score and structural similarity demonstrates that our models are able to
effectively restore images and offer a two- to fourfold reduction in image
acquisition time by accurately reconstructing images from sparsely sampled
data. Our framework has the potential to significantly increase STM
experimental throughput by offering a route to reducing the frequency of
tip-conditioning procedures and to enhancing frame rates in existing high-speed
STM systems.

### [5] [SplitFlow: Flow Decomposition for Inversion-Free Text-to-Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25970)
*Sung-Hoon Yoon,Minghan Li,Gaspard Beaudouin,Congcong Wen,Muhammad Rafay Azhar,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于流分解与聚合的零样本图像编辑框架，通过语义分解目标提示、计算独立子流并自适应聚合来解决现有流模型在图像编辑中的反转不准确和梯度纠缠问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有流模型在图像生成方面表现出色，但在图像编辑任务中存在关键限制：反转过程不准确导致真实图像难以映射回潜在空间，编辑过程中的梯度纠缠问题使得输出无法忠实反映目标提示。

Method: 采用无反转的流分解与聚合框架，将目标提示语义分解为多个子提示，为每个子提示计算独立流，然后通过投影和软聚合机制自适应加权子目标速度场，抑制语义冗余同时强调不同方向。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在语义保真度和属性解耦方面优于现有的零样本编辑方法，能够生成既多样又一致的编辑输出。

Conclusion: 提出的流分解与聚合框架有效解决了流模型在图像编辑中的核心问题，通过语义分解和自适应聚合机制实现了高质量的零样本图像编辑。

Abstract: Rectified flow models have become a de facto standard in image generation due
to their stable sampling trajectories and high-fidelity outputs. Despite their
strong generative capabilities, they face critical limitations in image editing
tasks: inaccurate inversion processes for mapping real images back into the
latent space, and gradient entanglement issues during editing often result in
outputs that do not faithfully reflect the target prompt. Recent efforts have
attempted to directly map source and target distributions via ODE-based
approaches without inversion; however,these methods still yield suboptimal
editing quality. In this work, we propose a flow decomposition-and-aggregation
framework built upon an inversion-free formulation to address these
limitations. Specifically, we semantically decompose the target prompt into
multiple sub-prompts, compute an independent flow for each, and aggregate them
to form a unified editing trajectory. While we empirically observe that
decomposing the original flow enhances diversity in the target space,
generating semantically aligned outputs still requires consistent guidance
toward the full target prompt. To this end, we design a projection and
soft-aggregation mechanism for flow, inspired by gradient conflict resolution
in multi-task learning. This approach adaptively weights the sub-target
velocity fields, suppressing semantic redundancy while emphasizing distinct
directions, thereby preserving both diversity and consistency in the final
edited output. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing zero-shot editing approaches in terms of semantic fidelity and
attribute disentanglement. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）已成为3D场景表示的重要突破，引发了效率提升、动态表示、数学基础、移动平台应用和大规模环境扩展等多个研究方向的发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS的引入迅速改变了3D场景表示的格局，激发了大量相关研究，旨在提升其效率、可扩展性和实际应用性。

Method: 通过资源高效训练与渲染、动态4D表示、数学基础探索、移动平台适配、大规模环境扩展以及快速辐射场重建等多种技术路径来推进3DGS的发展。

Abstract: Since its introduction, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has rapidly transformed
the landscape of 3D scene representations, inspiring an extensive body of
associated research. Follow-up work includes analyses and contributions that
enhance the efficiency, scalability, and real-world applicability of 3DGS. In
this summary, we present an overview of several key directions that have
emerged in the wake of 3DGS. We highlight advances enabling resource-efficient
training and rendering, the evolution toward dynamic (or four-dimensional,
4DGS) representations, and deeper exploration of the mathematical foundations
underlying its appearance modeling and rendering process. Furthermore, we
examine efforts to bring 3DGS to mobile and virtual reality platforms, its
extension to massive-scale environments, and recent progress toward
near-instant radiance field reconstruction via feed-forward or distributed
computation. Collectively, these developments illustrate how 3DGS has evolved
from a breakthrough representation into a versatile and foundational tool for
3D vision and graphics.

### [7] [Brain-IT: Image Reconstruction from fMRI via Brain-Interaction Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25976)
*Roman Beliy,Amit Zalcher,Jonathan Kogman,Navve Wasserman,Michal Irani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Brain-IT方法，通过脑交互变换器(BIT)从fMRI脑记录中重建视觉图像，在有限数据下实现高保真重建，性能超越现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的fMRI图像重建方法缺乏对实际所见图像的真实还原，需要更有效的大脑-图像交互机制

Method: 使用脑交互变换器(BIT)实现功能相似脑体素簇之间的有效交互，预测高层语义特征和低层结构特征来指导扩散模型

Result: 在fMRI图像重建中实现高保真重建，视觉和客观指标均超越现有方法，仅需1小时数据即可达到40小时数据的重建效果

Conclusion: Brain-IT通过脑功能簇共享和局部化特征预测，为fMRI图像重建提供了有效解决方案，显著减少数据需求并提升重建质量

Abstract: Reconstructing images seen by people from their fMRI brain recordings
provides a non-invasive window into the human brain. Despite recent progress
enabled by diffusion models, current methods often lack faithfulness to the
actual seen images. We present "Brain-IT", a brain-inspired approach that
addresses this challenge through a Brain Interaction Transformer (BIT),
allowing effective interactions between clusters of functionally-similar
brain-voxels. These functional-clusters are shared by all subjects, serving as
building blocks for integrating information both within and across brains. All
model components are shared by all clusters & subjects, allowing efficient
training with a limited amount of data. To guide the image reconstruction, BIT
predicts two complementary localized patch-level image features: (i)high-level
semantic features which steer the diffusion model toward the correct semantic
content of the image; and (ii)low-level structural features which help to
initialize the diffusion process with the correct coarse layout of the image.
BIT's design enables direct flow of information from brain-voxel clusters to
localized image features. Through these principles, our method achieves image
reconstructions from fMRI that faithfully reconstruct the seen images, and
surpass current SotA approaches both visually and by standard objective
metrics. Moreover, with only 1-hour of fMRI data from a new subject, we achieve
results comparable to current methods trained on full 40-hour recordings.

### [8] [HEIR: Learning Graph-Based Motion Hierarchies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26786)
*Cheng Zheng,William Koch,Baiang Li,Felix Heide*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种通用的层次化运动建模方法，通过图神经网络学习数据驱动的运动层次结构，将全局绝对运动分解为父级继承模式和局部运动残差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖手动定义或启发式的固定运动基元层次结构，限制了在不同任务间的泛化能力。需要一种能够直接从数据中学习结构化、可解释运动关系的通用方法。

Method: 将层次推断表述为可微分图学习问题，顶点表示基本运动，有向边通过图神经网络捕获学习的父子依赖关系，使用基于图的层次结构表示观测运动。

Result: 在1D平移运动、2D旋转运动和3D高斯溅射场景变形三个示例上验证，成功重建了1D和2D案例的内在运动层次，在动态3D高斯溅射场景上相比基线产生更真实和可解释的变形。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个适应性强、数据驱动的层次建模范式，适用于广泛的运动中心任务，为运动建模提供了通用的公式化方法。

Abstract: Hierarchical structures of motion exist across research fields, including
computer vision, graphics, and robotics, where complex dynamics typically arise
from coordinated interactions among simpler motion components. Existing methods
to model such dynamics typically rely on manually-defined or heuristic
hierarchies with fixed motion primitives, limiting their generalizability
across different tasks. In this work, we propose a general hierarchical motion
modeling method that learns structured, interpretable motion relationships
directly from data. Our method represents observed motions using graph-based
hierarchies, explicitly decomposing global absolute motions into
parent-inherited patterns and local motion residuals. We formulate hierarchy
inference as a differentiable graph learning problem, where vertices represent
elemental motions and directed edges capture learned parent-child dependencies
through graph neural networks. We evaluate our hierarchical reconstruction
approach on three examples: 1D translational motion, 2D rotational motion, and
dynamic 3D scene deformation via Gaussian splatting. Experimental results show
that our method reconstructs the intrinsic motion hierarchy in 1D and 2D cases,
and produces more realistic and interpretable deformations compared to the
baseline on dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting scenes. By providing an adaptable,
data-driven hierarchical modeling paradigm, our method offers a formulation
applicable to a broad range of motion-centric tasks. Project Page:

*Valentin Boussot,Cédric Hémon,Jean-Claude Nunes,Jean-Louis Dillenseger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文针对TrackRAD2025挑战赛，在数据稀缺约束下开发了基于SAM 2.1基础模型的实时肿瘤跟踪方法，在隐藏测试集上获得0.8794的Dice分数，排名第6。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在胸腹部cine-MRI序列中实时肿瘤跟踪的挑战，特别是在强数据稀缺约束下，为MRI引导的放射治疗提供准确跟踪方案。

Method: 探索了两种策略：无监督配准和基于SAM 2.1基础模型的分割方法。最终选择SAM2.1 b+模型，使用第一张标注切片的掩码提示，在TrackRAD2025小标注子集上微调，采用平衡Dice+IoU损失和低学习率训练。

Result: 在隐藏测试集上达到0.8794的Dice分数，在TrackRAD2025挑战赛中排名第6，满足1秒运行时间约束。

Conclusion: 基础模型在MRI引导放射治疗的准确实时肿瘤跟踪方面展现出强大潜力。

Abstract: In this work, we address the TrackRAD2025 challenge of real-time tumor
tracking in cine-MRI sequences of the thoracic and abdominal regions under
strong data scarcity constraints. Two complementary strategies were explored:
(i) unsupervised registration with the IMPACT similarity metric and (ii)
foundation model-based segmentation leveraging SAM 2.1 and its recent variants
through prompt-based interaction. Due to the one-second runtime constraint, the
SAM-based method was ultimately selected. The final configuration used SAM2.1
b+ with mask-based prompts from the first annotated slice, fine-tuned solely on
the small labeled subset from TrackRAD2025. Training was configured to minimize
overfitting, using 1024x1024 patches (batch size 1), standard augmentations,
and a balanced Dice + IoU loss. A low uniform learning rate (0.0001) was
applied to all modules (prompt encoder, decoder, Hiera backbone) to preserve
generalization while adapting to annotator-specific styles. Training lasted 300
epochs (~12h on RTX A6000, 48GB). The same inference strategy was consistently
applied across all anatomical sites and MRI field strengths. Test-time
augmentation was considered but ultimately discarded due to negligible
performance gains. The final model was selected based on the highest Dice
Similarity Coefficient achieved on the validation set after fine-tuning. On the
hidden test set, the model reached a Dice score of 0.8794, ranking 6th overall
in the TrackRAD2025 challenge. These results highlight the strong potential of
foundation models for accurate and real-time tumor tracking in MRI-guided
radiotherapy.

*Dongyue Lu,Ao Liang,Tianxin Huang,Xiao Fu,Yuyang Zhao,Baorui Ma,Liang Pan,Wei Yin,Lingdong Kong,Wei Tsang Ooi,Ziwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SEE4D是一个无需姿态标注的视频到4D生成框架，通过虚拟相机渲染和视图条件视频修复，实现从随意视频中合成时空4D内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频到4D方法依赖手动标注的相机姿态，成本高且对野外视频不鲁棒。warp-then-inpaint方法虽然无需姿态标签，但将相机运动与场景动态耦合，使建模和推理复杂化。

Method: 提出轨迹到相机框架，用固定虚拟相机渲染替代显式轨迹预测。训练视图条件视频修复模型学习几何先验，通过去噪合成扭曲图像和修复遮挡区域。设计时空自回归推理流水线，遍历虚拟相机样条并以重叠窗口扩展视频。

Result: 在跨视图视频生成和稀疏重建基准测试中，SEE4D在定量指标和定性评估上均优于基于姿态或轨迹条件的基线方法。

Conclusion: SEE4D通过分离相机控制与场景建模，实现了从随意视频中实用的4D世界建模，具有更好的泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: Immersive applications call for synthesizing spatiotemporal 4D content from
casual videos without costly 3D supervision. Existing video-to-4D methods
typically rely on manually annotated camera poses, which are labor-intensive
and brittle for in-the-wild footage. Recent warp-then-inpaint approaches
mitigate the need for pose labels by warping input frames along a novel camera
trajectory and using an inpainting model to fill missing regions, thereby
depicting the 4D scene from diverse viewpoints. However, this
trajectory-to-trajectory formulation often entangles camera motion with scene
dynamics and complicates both modeling and inference. We introduce SEE4D, a
pose-free, trajectory-to-camera framework that replaces explicit trajectory
prediction with rendering to a bank of fixed virtual cameras, thereby
separating camera control from scene modeling. A view-conditional video
inpainting model is trained to learn a robust geometry prior by denoising
realistically synthesized warped images and to inpaint occluded or missing
regions across virtual viewpoints, eliminating the need for explicit 3D
annotations. Building on this inpainting core, we design a spatiotemporal
autoregressive inference pipeline that traverses virtual-camera splines and
extends videos with overlapping windows, enabling coherent generation at
bounded per-step complexity. We validate See4D on cross-view video generation
and sparse reconstruction benchmarks. Across quantitative metrics and
qualitative assessments, our method achieves superior generalization and
improved performance relative to pose- or trajectory-conditioned baselines,
advancing practical 4D world modeling from casual videos.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Hilbert选择性扫描机制的Mamba框架增强方法，通过提高扫描模式的Hausdorff维度来更有效地探索特征空间，提升低光图像增强性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Mamba框架在特征空间探索方面存在局限，无法充分捕捉精细尺度的细节信息，导致信息不一致性和空间局部性不足的问题。

Method: 引入Hilbert选择性扫描机制，通过增加扫描模式的Hausdorff维度来改进特征空间探索，同时保持处理长程依赖关系的能力。

Result: 在公开基准测试中显著提升了定量指标和定性视觉保真度，同时减少了计算资源消耗和推理时间。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅推进了低光图像增强的技术水平，还为基于Mamba技术的更广泛应用领域提供了潜力。

Abstract: We propose an innovative enhancement to the Mamba framework by increasing the
Hausdorff dimension of its scanning pattern through a novel Hilbert Selective
Scan mechanism. This mechanism explores the feature space more effectively,
capturing intricate fine-scale details and improving overall coverage. As a
result, it mitigates information inconsistencies while refining spatial
locality to better capture subtle local interactions without sacrificing the
model's ability to handle long-range dependencies. Extensive experiments on
publicly available benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly
improves both the quantitative metrics and qualitative visual fidelity of
existing Mamba-based low-light image enhancement methods, all while reducing
computational resource consumption and shortening inference time. We believe
that this refined strategy not only advances the state-of-the-art in low-light
image enhancement but also holds promise for broader applications in fields
that leverage Mamba-based techniques.

Motivation: 现有2D提升方法主要关注外观生成而忽略内在属性感知，需要推进全景2D提升技术来生成适合物理渲染、重新光照和模拟的图形就绪3D场景。

Method: 基于轻量高效的跨模态适配器结构，重新利用2D生成先验进行几何、纹理和PBR材质的全景感知，并构建大规模合成全景数据集。

Conclusion: OmniX框架通过重用2D生成先验，成功实现了全景视觉任务和图形就绪3D场景生成，推动了沉浸式虚拟世界生成技术的发展。

Abstract: There are two prevalent ways to constructing 3D scenes: procedural generation
and 2D lifting. Among them, panorama-based 2D lifting has emerged as a
promising technique, leveraging powerful 2D generative priors to produce
immersive, realistic, and diverse 3D environments. In this work, we advance
this technique to generate graphics-ready 3D scenes suitable for physically
based rendering (PBR), relighting, and simulation. Our key insight is to
repurpose 2D generative models for panoramic perception of geometry, textures,
and PBR materials. Unlike existing 2D lifting approaches that emphasize
appearance generation and ignore the perception of intrinsic properties, we
present OmniX, a versatile and unified framework. Based on a lightweight and
efficient cross-modal adapter structure, OmniX reuses 2D generative priors for
a broad range of panoramic vision tasks, including panoramic perception,
generation, and completion. Furthermore, we construct a large-scale synthetic
panorama dataset containing high-quality multimodal panoramas from diverse
indoor and outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our model in panoramic visual perception and graphics-ready 3D scene
generation, opening new possibilities for immersive and physically realistic
virtual world generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前计算机视觉中的异常检测局限于工业缺陷或合成异常，无法捕捉真实世界异常的丰富性和不可预测性，而人类能自然地识别、推理和解释环境中的异常。

Method: 构建CAVE基准，包含细粒度标注，基于视觉表现、复杂性、严重性和常见性对异常进行分类，并采用认知科学研究启发的方法来评估VLMs。

Result: 实验表明，即使采用先进的提示策略，最先进的视觉语言模型在视觉异常感知和常识推理方面仍存在困难。

Conclusion: CAVE作为一个现实且认知基础扎实的基准，为推进VLMs在异常检测和常识推理方面的研究提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: Humans can naturally identify, reason about, and explain anomalies in their
environment. In computer vision, this long-standing challenge remains limited
to industrial defects or unrealistic, synthetically generated anomalies,
failing to capture the richness and unpredictability of real-world anomalies.
In this work, we introduce CAVE, the first benchmark of real-world visual
anomalies. CAVE supports three open-ended tasks: anomaly description,
explanation, and justification; with fine-grained annotations for visual
grounding and categorizing anomalies based on their visual manifestations,
their complexity, severity, and commonness. These annotations draw inspiration
from cognitive science research on how humans identify and resolve anomalies,
providing a comprehensive framework for evaluating Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) in detecting and understanding anomalies. We show that state-of-the-art
VLMs struggle with visual anomaly perception and commonsense reasoning, even
with advanced prompting strategies. By offering a realistic and cognitively
grounded benchmark, CAVE serves as a valuable resource for advancing research
in anomaly detection and commonsense reasoning in VLMs.

Abstract: Climate change and sea-level rise (SLR) pose escalating threats to coastal
cities, intensifying the need for efficient and accurate methods to predict
potential flood hazards. Traditional physics-based hydrodynamic simulators,
although precise, are computationally expensive and impractical for city-scale
coastal planning applications. Deep Learning (DL) techniques offer promising
alternatives, however, they are often constrained by challenges such as data
scarcity and high-dimensional output requirements. Leveraging a recently
proposed vision-based, low-resource DL framework, we develop a novel,
lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model designed to predict
coastal flooding under variable SLR projections and shoreline adaptation
scenarios. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of the model to generalize
across diverse geographical contexts by utilizing datasets from two distinct
regions: Abu Dhabi and San Francisco. Our findings demonstrate that the
proposed model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing the
mean absolute error (MAE) in predicted flood depth maps on average by nearly
20%. These results highlight the potential of our approach to serve as a
scalable and practical tool for coastal flood management, empowering
decision-makers to develop effective mitigation strategies in response to the
growing impacts of climate change. Project Page: https://caspiannet.github.io/

TL;DR: 提出了一种在视觉编码器中引入堆叠时序注意力模块的Video-LLM架构，显著提升了视频时序理解能力，在多个基准测试中性能提升达5.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型在理解复杂时序动态方面存在严重局限，难以处理需要详细理解动作序列和时序进展的任务。

Method: 在视觉编码器中直接引入堆叠时序注意力模块，通过时序注意力机制使模型能够更好地捕捉动作进展和帧间关系，然后再将视觉token传递给LLM。

Result: 该方法显著改善了时序推理能力，在视频问答任务特别是动作识别方面优于现有模型，在VITATECS、MVBench和Video-MME等基准测试中性能提升最高达5.5%。

Conclusion: 通过在视觉编码器中增强时序结构，解决了Video-LLMs在视频理解方面的关键差距。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs),
understanding complex temporal dynamics in videos remains a major challenge.
Our experiments show that current Video Large Language Model (Video-LLM)
architectures have critical limitations in temporal understanding, struggling
with tasks that require detailed comprehension of action sequences and temporal
progression. In this work, we propose a Video-LLM architecture that introduces
stacked temporal attention modules directly within the vision encoder. This
design incorporates a temporal attention in vision encoder, enabling the model
to better capture the progression of actions and the relationships between
frames before passing visual tokens to the LLM. Our results show that this
approach significantly improves temporal reasoning and outperforms existing
models in video question answering tasks, specifically in action recognition.
We improve on benchmarks including VITATECS, MVBench, and Video-MME by up to
+5.5%. By enhancing the vision encoder with temporal structure, we address a
critical gap in video understanding for Video-LLMs. Project page and code are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决儿科肘部和手腕骨折超声诊断中像素级专家标注耗时耗力的问题，帮助轻培训用户更自信地进行检查。

Method: 提出FlexICL框架，采用上下文学习策略，系统研究图像拼接技术和训练策略，引入新颖的拼接方法增强模型性能。

Result: 在1,252个超声扫描上，比Painter、MAE-VQGAN等最先进视觉ICL模型以及U-Net、TransUNet等传统分割模型Dice系数提升1-27%。

Conclusion: FlexICL为超声图像分割提供了一种高效可扩展的解决方案，特别适用于标注数据稀缺的医学影像应用场景。

Abstract: Elbow and wrist fractures are the most common fractures in pediatric
populations. Automatic segmentation of musculoskeletal structures in ultrasound
(US) can improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning. Fractures appear
as cortical defects but require expert interpretation. Deep learning (DL) can
provide real-time feedback and highlight key structures, helping lightly
trained users perform exams more confidently. However, pixel-wise expert
annotations for training remain time-consuming and costly. To address this
challenge, we propose FlexICL, a novel and flexible in-context learning (ICL)
framework for segmenting bony regions in US images. We apply it to an
intra-video segmentation setting, where experts annotate only a small subset of
frames, and the model segments unseen frames. We systematically investigate
various image concatenation techniques and training strategies for visual ICL
and introduce novel concatenation methods that significantly enhance model
performance with limited labeled data. By integrating multiple augmentation
strategies, FlexICL achieves robust segmentation performance across four wrist
and elbow US datasets while requiring only 5% of the training images. It
outperforms state-of-the-art visual ICL models like Painter, MAE-VQGAN, and
conventional segmentation models like U-Net and TransUNet by 1-27% Dice
coefficient on 1,252 US sweeps. These initial results highlight the potential
of FlexICL as an efficient and scalable solution for US image segmentation well
suited for medical imaging use cases where labeled data is scarce.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统负提示方法使用固定的负提示，缺乏上下文适应性，无法根据生成过程中的中间结果动态调整。

Method: 在特定去噪步骤生成中间图像预测，然后查询视觉语言模型来生成上下文相关的负提示。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上评估，展示了负引导强度与文本图像对齐之间的权衡关系。

Conclusion: 动态负提示方法能够更有效地控制扩散模型的生成过程，在保持文本图像对齐的同时提供灵活的负引导。

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for dynamic negative prompting in diffusion
models that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to adaptively generate
negative prompts during the denoising process. Unlike traditional Negative
Prompting methods that use fixed negative prompts, our method generates
intermediate image predictions at specific denoising steps and queries a VLM to
produce contextually appropriate negative prompts. We evaluate our approach on
various benchmark datasets and demonstrate the trade-offs between negative
guidance strength and text-image alignment.

TL;DR: 提出了PReMA攻击方法，通过仅修改输入图像而不改变提示词，就能操控多模态扩散模型生成不当内容，揭示了现有模型在文本-图像对齐方面的脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态扩散模型在文本和图像模态对齐方面存在不足，这种错位可能导致生成不当或NSFW内容的风险，但目前对此类攻击的研究较少。

Method: 提出了Prompt-Restricted Multi-modal Attack (PReMA)方法，通过仅创建对抗性图像来操控模型输出，无需修改提示词本身。

Result: 在图像修复和风格迁移任务上的综合评估证实了PReMA的有效性，能够成功操控各种模型的生成内容。

Conclusion: PReMA对多模态扩散模型的完整性构成了新型威胁，特别是在使用固定提示词的图像编辑应用中，凸显了模型安全性的重要性。

Abstract: Despite the notable advancements and versatility of multi-modal diffusion
models, such as text-to-image models, their susceptibility to adversarial
inputs remains underexplored. Contrary to expectations, our investigations
reveal that the alignment between textual and Image modalities in existing
diffusion models is inadequate. This misalignment presents significant risks,
especially in the generation of inappropriate or Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW)
content. To this end, we propose a novel attack called Prompt-Restricted
Multi-modal Attack (PReMA) to manipulate the generated content by modifying the
input image in conjunction with any specified prompt, without altering the
prompt itself. PReMA is the first attack that manipulates model outputs by
solely creating adversarial images, distinguishing itself from prior methods
that primarily generate adversarial prompts to produce NSFW content.
Consequently, PReMA poses a novel threat to the integrity of multi-modal
diffusion models, particularly in image-editing applications that operate with
fixed prompts. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on image inpainting and
style transfer tasks across various models confirm the potent efficacy of
PReMA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究视频LLM在从不同视角捕捉同一事件的视频中是否能保持时间理解的一致性，现有模型在跨视角一致性方面表现不佳。

Method: 引入EgoExo-Con基准，包含同步的自我中心和他者中心视频对，提出View-GRPO强化学习框架来增强跨视角时间推理的一致性。

Result: 现有视频LLM在跨视角一致性方面表现较差，简单微调会降低单视角性能，View-GRPO方法在改善跨视角一致性方面优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 跨视角时间理解一致性是视频LLM的重要挑战，View-GRPO框架能有效提升模型在多个视角下的时间推理一致性。

Abstract: Can Video-LLMs achieve consistent temporal understanding when videos capture
the same event from different viewpoints? To study this, we introduce
EgoExo-Con (Consistency), a benchmark of comprehensively synchronized
egocentric and exocentric video pairs with human-refined queries in natural
language. EgoExo-Con emphasizes two temporal understanding tasks: Temporal
Verification and Temporal Grounding. It evaluates not only correctness but
consistency across viewpoints. Our analysis reveals two critical limitations of
existing Video-LLMs: (1) models often fail to maintain consistency, with
results far worse than their single-view performances. (2) When naively
finetuned with synchronized videos of both viewpoints, the models show improved
consistency but often underperform those trained on a single view. For
improvements, we propose View-GRPO, a novel reinforcement learning framework
that effectively strengthens view-specific temporal reasoning while encouraging
consistent comprehension across viewpoints. Our method demonstrates its
superiority over naive SFT and GRPO, especially for improving cross-view
consistency. All resources will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 甲骨文研究面临两大挑战：复杂的多任务解释流程，以及信息组织和检索效率低下。学者需要花费大量时间搜索、整理和管理相关资源。

Method: 构建了包含140万单字拓片图像和8万解释文本的多模态知识库，开发OracleAgent系统整合多个甲骨文分析工具，利用LLM灵活编排这些组件。

Result: 实验表明OracleAgent在多模态推理和生成任务中表现优异，超越主流MLLMs（如GPT-4o）；案例研究证实能有效协助领域专家，显著降低研究时间成本。

Conclusion: OracleAgent为实现甲骨文辅助研究和自动化解释系统的实际部署迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: As one of the earliest writing systems, Oracle Bone Script (OBS) preserves
the cultural and intellectual heritage of ancient civilizations. However,
current OBS research faces two major challenges: (1) the interpretation of OBS
involves a complex workflow comprising multiple serial and parallel sub-tasks,
and (2) the efficiency of OBS information organization and retrieval remains a
critical bottleneck, as scholars often spend substantial effort searching for,
compiling, and managing relevant resources. To address these challenges, we
present OracleAgent, the first agent system designed for the structured
management and retrieval of OBS-related information. OracleAgent seamlessly
integrates multiple OBS analysis tools, empowered by large language models
(LLMs), and can flexibly orchestrate these components. Additionally, we
construct a comprehensive domain-specific multimodal knowledge base for OBS,
which is built through a rigorous multi-year process of data collection,
cleaning, and expert annotation. The knowledge base comprises over 1.4M
single-character rubbing images and 80K interpretation texts. OracleAgent
leverages this resource through its multimodal tools to assist experts in
retrieval tasks of character, document, interpretation text, and rubbing image.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that OracleAgent achieves superior
performance across a range of multimodal reasoning and generation tasks,
surpassing leading mainstream multimodal large language models (MLLMs) (e.g.,
GPT-4o). Furthermore, our case study illustrates that OracleAgent can
effectively assist domain experts, significantly reducing the time cost of OBS
research. These results highlight OracleAgent as a significant step toward the
practical deployment of OBS-assisted research and automated interpretation
systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种联合优化3D高斯点和相机姿态的统一框架，无需预校准输入，通过交替优化策略同时提升场景重建保真度和姿态精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统新视角合成方法依赖外部相机姿态估计工具如COLMAP，这会带来计算瓶颈和误差传播问题。

Method: 将联合优化解耦为两个交替阶段：固定姿态下通过可微分渲染更新3D高斯参数，然后使用结合几何和光度约束的自定义3D光流算法优化相机姿态。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛评估表明，该方法在重建质量上显著优于现有的无COLMAP技术，并且总体上超越了基于COLMAP的标准基线。

Conclusion: 该联合优化框架能够有效处理具有大视角变化和稀疏特征分布的挑战性场景，逐步减少投影误差。

Abstract: Traditional novel view synthesis methods heavily rely on external camera pose
estimation tools such as COLMAP, which often introduce computational
bottlenecks and propagate errors. To address these challenges, we propose a
unified framework that jointly optimizes 3D Gaussian points and camera poses
without requiring pre-calibrated inputs. Our approach iteratively refines 3D
Gaussian parameters and updates camera poses through a novel co-optimization
strategy, ensuring simultaneous improvements in scene reconstruction fidelity
and pose accuracy. The key innovation lies in decoupling the joint optimization
into two interleaved phases: first, updating 3D Gaussian parameters via
differentiable rendering with fixed poses, and second, refining camera poses
using a customized 3D optical flow algorithm that incorporates geometric and
photometric constraints. This formulation progressively reduces projection
errors, particularly in challenging scenarios with large viewpoint variations
and sparse feature distributions, where traditional methods struggle. Extensive
evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly
outperforms existing COLMAP-free techniques in reconstruction quality, and also
surpasses the standard COLMAP-based baseline in general.

Motivation: 当前端到端驾驶基准主要关注常规场景，无法充分测试系统在罕见但关键的长尾场景中的性能，且现有评估指标难以有效评估多模态驾驶行为。

Method: 构建了包含4,021个驾驶片段（约12小时）的WOD-E2E数据集，专门针对发生频率低于0.03%的挑战性长尾场景，并提出了基于评分者偏好标签的RFS评估指标。

Result: WOD-E2E数据集包含了高层路由信息、自车状态和8个环绕摄像头的360度视角，验证集已发布评分者偏好标签，测试集用于2025年WOD-E2E挑战赛。

Conclusion: 该工作旨在推动可泛化、鲁棒且安全的端到端自动驾驶代理的研究，使其能够处理复杂的现实世界情况。

Abstract: Vision-based end-to-end (E2E) driving has garnered significant interest in
the research community due to its scalability and synergy with multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). However, current E2E driving benchmarks primarily
feature nominal scenarios, failing to adequately test the true potential of
these systems. Furthermore, existing open-loop evaluation metrics often fall
short in capturing the multi-modal nature of driving or effectively evaluating
performance in long-tail scenarios. To address these gaps, we introduce the
Waymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving (WOD-E2E). WOD-E2E contains 4,021
driving segments (approximately 12 hours), specifically curated for challenging
long-tail scenarios that that are rare in daily life with an occurring
frequency of less than 0.03%. Concretely, each segment in WOD-E2E includes the
high-level routing information, ego states, and 360-degree camera views from 8
surrounding cameras. To evaluate the E2E driving performance on these long-tail
situations, we propose a novel open-loop evaluation metric: Rater Feedback
Score (RFS). Unlike conventional metrics that measure the distance between
predicted way points and the logs, RFS measures how closely the predicted
trajectory matches rater-annotated trajectory preference labels. We have
released rater preference labels for all WOD-E2E validation set segments, while
the held out test set labels have been used for the 2025 WOD-E2E Challenge.
Through our work, we aim to foster state of the art research into
generalizable, robust, and safe end-to-end autonomous driving agents capable of
handling complex real-world situations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种将基于梯度的网络注意力信息与CNN特征表示相结合的方法，用于改进RGB-D室内SLAM系统的帧关联性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然注意力模型在多个领域取得显著进展，但将梯度注意力信息直接集成到CNN表示中以进行语义对象理解的应用仍然有限。这种集成对于视觉任务（如SLAM）特别有益，因为增强空间注意力对象位置的CNN表示可以提升性能。

Method: 利用任务特定的网络注意力，将基于网络梯度的分层注意力信息与CNN特征表示相结合，以改进帧关联性能。

Result: 实验结果表明，与基线方法相比，该方法性能有所提升，特别是在大型环境中表现更佳。

Conclusion: 将梯度注意力信息与CNN特征表示集成可以有效提升RGB-D室内SLAM系统的性能，尤其是在大规模环境中。

Abstract: Attention models have recently emerged as a powerful approach, demonstrating
significant progress in various fields. Visualization techniques, such as class
activation mapping, provide visual insights into the reasoning of convolutional
neural networks (CNNs). Using network gradients, it is possible to identify
regions where the network pays attention during image recognition tasks.
Furthermore, these gradients can be combined with CNN features to localize more
generalizable, task-specific attentive (salient) regions within scenes.
However, explicit use of this gradient-based attention information integrated
directly into CNN representations for semantic object understanding remains
limited. Such integration is particularly beneficial for visual tasks like
simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), where CNN representations
enriched with spatially attentive object locations can enhance performance. In
this work, we propose utilizing task-specific network attention for RGB-D
indoor SLAM. Specifically, we integrate layer-wise attention information
derived from network gradients with CNN feature representations to improve
frame association performance. Experimental results indicate improved
performance compared to baseline methods, particularly for large environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D部件生成方法存在两个主要问题：隐式向量集表示缺乏足够的几何细节，而显式体素表示中共享全局体素网格会导致小部件占据过少体素而质量下降。

Method: FullPart首先通过隐式边界框向量集扩散过程推导边界框布局，然后在各自的全分辨率体素网格中生成详细部件。引入中心点编码策略解决不同尺寸部件间的信息交换对齐问题。

Result: 该方法能够生成具有复杂细节的3D部件，即使小部件也能保持高质量。实验证明FullPart在3D部件生成方面达到了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: FullPart通过结合隐式和显式表示的优点，有效解决了3D部件生成中的几何细节和部件质量问题，同时构建了最大的PartVerse-XL数据集来支持该领域的研究。

Abstract: Part-based 3D generation holds great potential for various applications.
Previous part generators that represent parts using implicit vector-set tokens
often suffer from insufficient geometric details. Another line of work adopts
an explicit voxel representation but shares a global voxel grid among all
parts; this often causes small parts to occupy too few voxels, leading to
degraded quality. In this paper, we propose FullPart, a novel framework that
combines both implicit and explicit paradigms. It first derives the bounding
box layout through an implicit box vector-set diffusion process, a task that
implicit diffusion handles effectively since box tokens contain little
geometric detail. Then, it generates detailed parts, each within its own fixed
full-resolution voxel grid. Instead of sharing a global low-resolution space,
each part in our method - even small ones - is generated at full resolution,
enabling the synthesis of intricate details. We further introduce a
center-point encoding strategy to address the misalignment issue when
exchanging information between parts of different actual sizes, thereby
maintaining global coherence. Moreover, to tackle the scarcity of reliable part
data, we present PartVerse-XL, the largest human-annotated 3D part dataset to
date with 40K objects and 320K parts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FullPart achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D part generation. We will
release all code, data, and model to benefit future research in 3D part
generation.

Abstract: Arbitrary-scale video super-resolution (AVSR) aims to enhance the resolution
of video frames, potentially at various scaling factors, which presents several
challenges regarding spatial detail reproduction, temporal consistency, and
computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a strong baseline BasicAVSR
for AVSR by integrating four key components: 1) adaptive multi-scale frequency
priors generated from image Laplacian pyramids, 2) a flow-guided propagation
unit to aggregate spatiotemporal information from adjacent frames, 3) a
second-order motion compensation unit for more accurate spatial alignment of
adjacent frames, and 4) a hyper-upsampling unit to generate scale-aware and
content-independent upsampling kernels. To meet diverse application demands, we
instantiate three propagation variants: (i) a unidirectional RNN unit for
strictly online inference, (ii) a unidirectional RNN unit empowered with a
limited lookahead that tolerates a small output delay, and (iii) a
bidirectional RNN unit designed for offline tasks where computational resources
are less constrained. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and
adaptability of our model across these different scenarios. Through extensive
experiments, we show that BasicAVSR significantly outperforms existing methods
in terms of super-resolution quality, generalization ability, and inference
speed. Our work not only advances the state-of-the-art in AVSR but also extends
its core components to multiple frameworks for diverse scenarios. The code is

Abstract: Large annotated datasets are essential for training robust Computer-Aided
Diagnosis (CAD) models for breast cancer detection or risk prediction. However,
acquiring such datasets with fine-detailed annotation is both costly and
time-consuming. Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, which are
pre-trained on large image-text pairs, offer a promising solution by enhancing
robustness and data efficiency in medical imaging tasks. This paper introduces
a novel Multi-View Mammography and Language Model for breast cancer
classification and risk prediction, trained on a dataset of paired mammogram
images and synthetic radiology reports. Our MV-MLM leverages multi-view
supervision to learn rich representations from extensive radiology data by
employing cross-modal self-supervision across image-text pairs. This includes
multiple views and the corresponding pseudo-radiology reports. We propose a
novel joint visual-textual learning strategy to enhance generalization and
accuracy performance over different data types and tasks to distinguish breast
tissues or cancer characteristics(calcification, mass) and utilize these
patterns to understand mammography images and predict cancer risk. We evaluated
our method on both private and publicly available datasets, demonstrating that
the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in three
classification tasks: (1) malignancy classification, (2) subtype
classification, and (3) image-based cancer risk prediction. Furthermore, the
model exhibits strong data efficiency, outperforming existing fully supervised
or VLM baselines while trained on synthetic text reports and without the need
for actual radiology reports.

Abstract: Modes of transportation vary across countries depending on geographical
location and cultural context. In South Asian countries rickshaws are among the
most common means of local transport. Based on their mode of operation,
rickshaws in cities across Bangladesh can be broadly classified into non-auto
(pedal-powered) and auto-rickshaws (motorized). Monitoring the movement of
auto-rickshaws is necessary as traffic rules often restrict auto-rickshaws from
accessing certain routes. However, existing surveillance systems make it quite
difficult to monitor them due to their similarity to other vehicles, especially
non-auto rickshaws whereas manual video analysis is too time-consuming. This
paper presents a machine learning-based approach to automatically detect
auto-rickshaws in traffic images. In this system, we used real-time object
detection using the YOLOv8 model. For training purposes, we prepared a set of
1,730 annotated images that were captured under various traffic conditions. The
results show that our proposed model performs well in real-time auto-rickshaw
detection and offers an mAP50 of 83.447% and binary precision and recall values
above 78%, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling both dense and sparse
traffic scenarios. The dataset has been publicly released for further research.

TL;DR: CRAG-MM是一个针对多模态多轮对话的综合RAG基准测试，包含6.5K个(图像、问题、答案)三元组和2K个基于视觉的多轮对话，涵盖13个领域，专门设计用于评估可穿戴设备场景下的多模态检索增强生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏针对可穿戴设备场景的多模态检索增强生成(MM-RAG)的全面基准测试，特别是在多轮对话方面存在空白，需要建立一个能够反映真实世界挑战的评估标准。

Method: 构建了包含6.2K个模拟可穿戴设备拍摄的自我中心图像的多样化数据集，设计了五种图像质量问题、六种问题类型、不同实体流行度、信息动态性和对话轮次，并提供了图像-KG检索和网页检索API。

Result: 评估显示，简单RAG方法在单轮和多轮QA中的真实性分别仅为32%和43%，而最先进的工业解决方案质量相似(32%/45%)，表明仍有很大改进空间。

Conclusion: CRAG-MM基准测试已成功应用于KDD Cup 2025竞赛，吸引了约1K参与者和5K提交，获胜方案将基线性能提升了28%，证明其对推动该领域发展具有重要影响。

Abstract: Wearable devices such as smart glasses are transforming the way people
interact with their surroundings, enabling users to seek information regarding
entities in their view. Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MM-RAG)
plays a key role in supporting such questions, yet there is still no
comprehensive benchmark for this task, especially regarding wearables
scenarios. To fill this gap, we present CRAG-MM -- a Comprehensive RAG
benchmark for Multi-modal Multi-turn conversations. CRAG-MM contains a diverse
set of 6.5K (image, question, answer) triplets and 2K visual-based multi-turn
conversations across 13 domains, including 6.2K egocentric images designed to
mimic captures from wearable devices. We carefully constructed the questions to
reflect real-world scenarios and challenges, including five types of
image-quality issues, six question types, varying entity popularity, differing
information dynamism, and different conversation turns. We design three tasks:
single-source augmentation, multi-source augmentation, and multi-turn
conversations -- each paired with an associated retrieval corpus and APIs for
both image-KG retrieval and webpage retrieval. Our evaluation shows that
straightforward RAG approaches achieve only 32% and 43% truthfulness on CRAG-MM
single- and multi-turn QA, respectively, whereas state-of-the-art industry
solutions have similar quality (32%/45%), underscoring ample room for
improvement. The benchmark has hosted KDD Cup 2025, attracting about 1K
participants and 5K submissions, with winning solutions improving baseline
performance by 28%, highlighting its early impact on advancing the field.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了首个基于扩散模型的高分辨率运动轨迹估计框架MoTDiff，能够从单张运动模糊图像中估计高质量的运动轨迹，在图像去模糊和编码曝光摄影应用中优于现有方法。


<details>

Motivation: 现有从单张模糊图像提取运动信息的方法（如模糊核和光流）质量较低，表现为粗粒度且不准确，需要高分辨率、高质量的运动轨迹估计方法。

Method: 提出MoTDiff框架，包含两个关键组件：1）使用从单张模糊图像提取的多尺度特征图作为条件的条件扩散框架；2）新的训练方法，促进精确识别细粒度运动轨迹、一致估计运动路径的整体形状和位置，以及沿运动轨迹的像素连通性。

Result: 实验表明，MoTDiff在盲图像去模糊和编码曝光摄影应用中能够超越最先进的方法。

Conclusion: MoTDiff是首个基于扩散模型的高分辨率运动轨迹估计框架，能够从单张运动模糊图像中估计出高质量的运动轨迹，在多个应用中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of motion information is crucial in diverse computational
imaging and computer vision applications. Researchers have investigated various
methods to extract motion information from a single blurred image, including
blur kernels and optical flow. However, existing motion representations are
often of low quality, i.e., coarse-grained and inaccurate. In this paper, we
propose the first high-resolution (HR) Motion Trajectory estimation framework
using Diffusion models (MoTDiff). Different from existing motion
representations, we aim to estimate an HR motion trajectory with high-quality
from a single motion-blurred image. The proposed MoTDiff consists of two key
components: 1) a new conditional diffusion framework that uses multi-scale
feature maps extracted from a single blurred image as a condition, and 2) a new
training method that can promote precise identification of a fine-grained
motion trajectory, consistent estimation of overall shape and position of a
motion path, and pixel connectivity along a motion trajectory. Our experiments
demonstrate that the proposed MoTDiff can outperform state-of-the-art methods
in both blind image deblurring and coded exposure photography applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ConceptScope是一个可扩展的自动化框架，使用稀疏自编码器从视觉基础模型中提取人类可解释的概念，用于分析数据集偏差、识别偏见概念，并进行鲁棒性评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习数据集中普遍存在数据点偏向某些概念的数据集偏差问题，但系统识别这些偏差需要昂贵的细粒度属性标注，因此需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 使用在视觉基础模型表示上训练的稀疏自编码器来发现和量化人类可解释的概念，根据语义相关性和统计相关性将概念分类为目标、上下文和偏见类型。

Result: ConceptScope能够捕捉广泛的视觉概念，产生与语义相关图像区域对齐的空间归因，可靠地检测已知偏见并发现未标注的新偏见。

Conclusion: ConceptScope为数据集审计和模型诊断提供了一个实用工具，能够自动识别和量化数据集中的概念偏差。

Abstract: Dataset bias, where data points are skewed to certain concepts, is ubiquitous
in machine learning datasets. Yet, systematically identifying these biases is
challenging without costly, fine-grained attribute annotations. We present
ConceptScope, a scalable and automated framework for analyzing visual datasets
by discovering and quantifying human-interpretable concepts using Sparse
Autoencoders trained on representations from vision foundation models.
ConceptScope categorizes concepts into target, context, and bias types based on
their semantic relevance and statistical correlation to class labels, enabling
class-level dataset characterization, bias identification, and robustness
evaluation through concept-based subgrouping. We validate that ConceptScope
captures a wide range of visual concepts, including objects, textures,
backgrounds, facial attributes, emotions, and actions, through comparisons with
annotated datasets. Furthermore, we show that concept activations produce
spatial attributions that align with semantically meaningful image regions.
ConceptScope reliably detects known biases (e.g., background bias in
Waterbirds) and uncovers previously unannotated ones (e.g, co-occurring objects
in ImageNet), offering a practical tool for dataset auditing and model
diagnostics.

Motivation: 解决草图到3D姿态估计的挑战，包括草图的抽象性和不成比例特性，以及缺乏大规模草图-3D姿态标注数据的问题。传统方法依赖优化和启发式规则，耗时且泛化能力有限。

Method: 采用'从合成中学习'策略：1)训练扩散模型从2D姿态合成草图图像；2)构建SKEP-120K合成数据集；3)结合2D姿态检测器和生成扩散先验进行草图特征提取；4)使用前馈神经网络进行2D姿态估计；5)引入多种启发式损失函数保证几何一致性。

Conclusion: 提出的基于合成学习的方法有效解决了草图到3D姿态估计的挑战，通过大规模合成数据和端到端框架实现了更好的性能和效率。

Abstract: 3D human pose estimation from sketches has broad applications in computer
animation and film production. Unlike traditional human pose estimation, this
task presents unique challenges due to the abstract and disproportionate nature
of sketches. Previous sketch-to-pose methods, constrained by the lack of
large-scale sketch-3D pose annotations, primarily relied on optimization with
heuristic rules-an approach that is both time-consuming and limited in
generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach
leveraging a "learn from synthesis" strategy. First, a diffusion model is
trained to synthesize sketch images from 2D poses projected from 3D human
poses, mimicking disproportionate human structures in sketches. This process
enables the creation of a synthetic dataset, SKEP-120K, consisting of 120k
accurate sketch-3D pose annotation pairs across various sketch styles. Building
on this synthetic dataset, we introduce an end-to-end data-driven framework for
estimating human poses and shapes from diverse sketch styles. Our framework
combines existing 2D pose detectors and generative diffusion priors for sketch
feature extraction with a feed-forward neural network for efficient 2D pose
estimation. Multiple heuristic loss functions are incorporated to guarantee
geometric coherence between the derived 3D poses and the detected 2D poses
while preserving accurate self-contacts. Qualitative, quantitative, and
subjective evaluations collectively show that our model substantially surpasses
previous ones in both estimation accuracy and speed for sketch-to-pose tasks.

Method: 使用混合卷积和几何深度学习，提出切比雪夫集成几何网络(Ch-EGN)，利用供应链中的信息依赖关系来推导数据库中样本的不可见状态。

Result: 在风险管理的平均准确率达到98.95%；在可持续供应链方面，5类产品分类准确率100%，4类产品关系分类准确率98.07%，25类公司关系分类准确率92.37%。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法相比现有最先进方法具有平均改进和效率提升，验证了该网络在供应链风险管理和可持续性分析中的有效性。

Abstract: The sustainability of supply chain plays a key role in achieving optimal
performance in controlling the supply chain. The management of risks that occur
in a supply chain is a fundamental problem for the purpose of developing the
sustainability of the network and elevating the performance efficiency of the
supply chain. The correct classification of products is another essential
element in a sustainable supply chain. Acknowledging recent breakthroughs in
the context of deep networks, several architectural options have been deployed
to analyze supply chain datasets. A novel geometric deep network is used to
propose an ensemble deep network. The proposed Chebyshev ensemble geometric
network (Ch-EGN) is a hybrid convolutional and geometric deep learning. This
network is proposed to leverage the information dependencies in supply chain to
derive invisible states of samples in the database. The functionality of the
proposed deep network is assessed on the two different databases. The
SupplyGraph Dataset and DataCo are considered in this research. The prediction
of delivery status of DataCo supply chain is done for risk administration. The
product classification and edge classification are performed using the
SupplyGraph database to enhance the sustainability of the supply network. An
average accuracy of 98.95% is obtained for the ensemble network for risk
management. The average accuracy of 100% and 98.07% are obtained for
sustainable supply chain in terms of 5 product group classification and 4
product relation classification, respectively. The average accuracy of 92.37%
is attained for 25 company relation classification. The results confirm an
average improvement and efficiency of the proposed method compared to the
state-of-the-art approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了OmniLayout-1M数据集和OmniLayout-LLM模型，解决了文档布局生成领域数据稀缺和复杂布局生成困难的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文档AI研究主要集中在文档布局分析，而文档布局生成研究不足。主要障碍在于缺乏多样化的布局数据，现有研究主要关注学术论文的曼哈顿式结构，而报纸、杂志等开放世界文档类型严重不足。

Method: 构建了首个百万级多样化文档布局数据集OmniLayout-1M，涵盖六种常见文档类型。提出了OmniLayout-LLM模型，采用两阶段粗到细学习范式：1）从OmniLayout-1M学习通用布局原则，2）将知识迁移到特定领域进行细粒度标注。

Result: 在M$^{6}$Doc数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在多个领域都取得了强劲性能，显著超越了现有的布局生成专家和多个最新的通用大语言模型。

Conclusion: OmniLayout-1M数据集和OmniLayout-LLM模型有效解决了文档布局生成领域的数据稀缺和复杂布局生成问题，为文档AI提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Document AI has advanced rapidly and is attracting increasing attention. Yet,
while most efforts have focused on document layout analysis (DLA), its
generative counterpart, document layout generation, remains underexplored. A
major obstacle lies in the scarcity of diverse layouts: academic papers with
Manhattan-style structures dominate existing studies, while open-world genres
such as newspapers and magazines remain severely underrepresented. To address
this gap, we curate OmniLayout-1M, the first million-scale dataset of diverse
document layouts, covering six common document types and comprising
contemporary layouts collected from multiple sources. Moreover, since existing
methods struggle in complex domains and often fail to arrange long sequences
coherently, we introduce OmniLayout-LLM, a 0.5B model with designed two-stage
Coarse-to-Fine learning paradigm: 1) learning universal layout principles from
OmniLayout-1M with coarse category definitions, and 2) transferring the
knowledge to a specific domain with fine-grained annotations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance on
multiple domains in M$^{6}$Doc dataset, substantially surpassing both existing
layout generation experts and several latest general-purpose LLMs. Our code,
models, and dataset will be publicly released.

TL;DR: 本文提出了AoT-PsyPhyBENCH基准，用于评估视觉语言模型在判断视频时间方向（正向或反向播放）方面的能力，发现大多数模型表现接近随机水平，远低于人类表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代视觉语言模型在多模态任务中表现出色，但对视频中时间信息的理解仍然薄弱且缺乏充分评估。本文旨在填补这一空白，通过判断时间方向这一简单但具有揭示性的挑战来评估模型的时间理解能力。

Method: 引入AoT-PsyPhyBENCH基准，使用经过心理物理学验证的刺激物和行为基线，评估开放权重和专有、推理和非推理的视觉语言模型在判断视频时间方向方面的表现。

Result: 大多数模型在物理不可逆过程（如自由落体、扩散/爆炸）和因果手动动作（除法/加法）上的表现接近随机水平，即使最好的模型也远低于人类准确率。

Conclusion: 当前多模态系统存在根本性差距：虽然它们能够捕捉丰富的视觉语义相关性，但缺乏时间连续性和因果理解所需的归纳偏差。

Abstract: Modern vision-language models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet
their grasp of temporal information in video remains weak and, crucially,
under-evaluated. We probe this gap with a deceptively simple but revealing
challenge: judging the arrow of time (AoT)-whether a short clip is played
forward or backward. We introduce AoT-PsyPhyBENCH, a psychophysically validated
benchmark that tests whether VLMs can infer temporal direction in natural
videos using the same stimuli and behavioral baselines established for humans.
Our comprehensive evaluation of open-weight and proprietary, reasoning and
non-reasoning VLMs reveals that most models perform near chance, and even the
best lag far behind human accuracy on physically irreversible processes (e.g.,
free fall, diffusion/explosion) and causal manual actions (division/addition)
that humans recognize almost instantly. These results highlight a fundamental
gap in current multimodal systems: while they capture rich visual-semantic
correlations, they lack the inductive biases required for temporal continuity
and causal understanding. We release the code and data for AoT-PsyPhyBENCH to
encourage further progress in the physical and temporal reasoning capabilities
of VLMs.

Conclusion: 基于人类认知启发的生成式图像融合方法在增强结构一致性和细节质量方面具有优势。

Abstract: Existing infrared and visible image fusion methods often face the dilemma of
balancing modal information. Generative fusion methods reconstruct fused images
by learning from data distributions, but their generative capabilities remain
limited. Moreover, the lack of interpretability in modal information selection
further affects the reliability and consistency of fusion results in complex
scenarios. This manuscript revisits the essence of generative image fusion
under the inspiration of human cognitive laws and proposes a novel infrared and
visible image fusion method, termed HCLFuse. First, HCLFuse investigates the
quantification theory of information mapping in unsupervised fusion networks,
which leads to the design of a multi-scale mask-regulated variational
bottleneck encoder. This encoder applies posterior probability modeling and
information decomposition to extract accurate and concise low-level modal
information, thereby supporting the generation of high-fidelity structural
details. Furthermore, the probabilistic generative capability of the diffusion
model is integrated with physical laws, forming a time-varying physical
guidance mechanism that adaptively regulates the generation process at
different stages, thereby enhancing the ability of the model to perceive the
intrinsic structure of data and reducing dependence on data quality.
Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
fusion performance in qualitative and quantitative evaluations across multiple
datasets and significantly improves semantic segmentation metrics. This fully
demonstrates the advantages of this generative image fusion method, drawing
inspiration from human cognition, in enhancing structural consistency and
detail quality.

Result: ResNet50单独表现最佳，但三种网络融合带来显著提升，热图显示不同网络关注不同区域，验证了互补性。该方法在UBIPr数据库上超越了先前工作。

Conclusion: 不同CNN架构在虹膜验证中具有互补性，网络融合策略能显著提升性能，为远距离生物识别提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We study the complementarity of different CNNs for periocular verification at
different distances on the UBIPr database. We train three architectures of
increasing complexity (SqueezeNet, MobileNetv2, and ResNet50) on a large set of
eye crops from VGGFace2. We analyse performance with cosine and chi2 metrics,
compare different network initialisations, and apply score-level fusion via
logistic regression. In addition, we use LIME heatmaps and Jensen-Shannon
divergence to compare attention patterns of the CNNs. While ResNet50
consistently performs best individually, the fusion provides substantial gains,
especially when combining all three networks. Heatmaps show that networks
usually focus on distinct regions of a given image, which explains their
complementarity. Our method significantly outperforms previous works on UBIPr,
achieving a new state-of-the-art.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模仿学习方法存在模式坍塌问题，无法生成多样化轨迹假设；而生成方法难以在生成过程中直接融入安全约束，需要额外优化阶段。

Method: 采用约束流匹配方法，在流匹配过程中直接施加显式约束，并将驾驶攻击性参数化为控制信号以操纵轨迹风格。

Result: 在NavSim v2挑战赛中获得第二名，EPDMS得分为51.31，并获得创新奖。

Conclusion: CATG框架有效解决了自动驾驶规划中的模式坍塌和约束集成问题，能够生成多样化且符合安全约束的轨迹。

Abstract: Planning is a critical component of end-to-end autonomous driving. However,
prevailing imitation learning methods often suffer from mode collapse, failing
to produce diverse trajectory hypotheses. Meanwhile, existing generative
approaches struggle to incorporate crucial safety and physical constraints
directly into the generative process, necessitating an additional optimization
stage to refine their outputs. To address these limitations, we propose CATG, a
novel planning framework that leverages Constrained Flow Matching. Concretely,
CATG explicitly models the flow matching process, which inherently mitigates
mode collapse and allows for flexible guidance from various conditioning
signals. Our primary contribution is the novel imposition of explicit
constraints directly within the flow matching process, ensuring that the
generated trajectories adhere to vital safety and kinematic rules. Secondly,
CATG parameterizes driving aggressiveness as a control signal during
generation, enabling precise manipulation of trajectory style. Notably, on the
NavSim v2 challenge, CATG achieved 2nd place with an EPDMS score of 51.31 and
was honored with the Innovation Award.

Motivation: 研究眼周区域生物识别，该区域具有高区分度和最小采集约束，旨在解决现有研究通常依赖小规模数据集训练的问题。

Method: 使用三种不同深度和复杂度的卷积神经网络架构，在包含1,907,572个眼部裁剪图像的大规模VGGFace2数据库上进行训练，并在VGGFace2-Pose和UFPR-Periocular数据集上进行实验评估。

Result: 在不受控的VGGFace2条件下，眼部裁剪图像的等错误率为9-15%，而全脸图像为3-6%；在UFPR-Periocular数据集上取得了1-2%的等错误率，这是目前该数据集上报告的最佳性能。

Conclusion: 眼周生物识别在高质量图像和一致采集协议下能取得优异性能，大规模训练数据对提升模型效果至关重要，UFPR-Periocular数据集上的结果证明了眼周区域作为生物识别特征的潜力。

Abstract: We focus on ocular biometrics, specifically the periocular region (the area
around the eye), which offers high discrimination and minimal acquisition
constraints. We evaluate three Convolutional Neural Network architectures of
varying depth and complexity to assess their effectiveness for periocular
recognition. The networks are trained on 1,907,572 ocular crops extracted from
the large-scale VGGFace2 database. This significantly contrasts with existing
works, which typically rely on small-scale periocular datasets for training
having only a few thousand images. Experiments are conducted with ocular images
from VGGFace2-Pose, a subset of VGGFace2 containing in-the-wild face images,
and the UFPR-Periocular database, which consists of selfies captured via mobile
devices with user guidance on the screen. Due to the uncontrolled conditions of
VGGFace2, the Equal Error Rates (EERs) obtained with ocular crops range from
9-15%, noticeably higher than the 3-6% EERs achieved using full-face images. In
contrast, UFPR-Periocular yields significantly better performance (EERs of
1-2%), thanks to higher image quality and more consistent acquisition
protocols. To the best of our knowledge, these are the lowest reported EERs on
the UFPR dataset to date.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理大规模场景、动态环境和严格约束时往往简化复杂性，限制了实际性能。需要更真实的基准测试和调度模型。

Method: 开发了包含3,907个卫星资产和16,410个场景的AEOS-Bench基准套件，并提出了基于Transformer的AEOS-Former调度模型，包含约束感知注意力机制和内部约束模块。

Conclusion: 该框架为AEOS星座调度提供了首个大规模基准测试和强大的调度解决方案，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Agile Earth Observation Satellites (AEOSs) constellations offer unprecedented
flexibility for monitoring the Earth's surface, but their scheduling remains
challenging under large-scale scenarios, dynamic environments, and stringent
constraints. Existing methods often simplify these complexities, limiting their
real-world performance. We address this gap with a unified framework
integrating a standardized benchmark suite and a novel scheduling model. Our
benchmark suite, AEOS-Bench, contains $3,907$ finely tuned satellite assets and
$16,410$ scenarios. Each scenario features $1$ to $50$ satellites and $50$ to
$300$ imaging tasks. These scenarios are generated via a high-fidelity
simulation platform, ensuring realistic satellite behavior such as orbital
dynamics and resource constraints. Ground truth scheduling annotations are
provided for each scenario. To our knowledge, AEOS-Bench is the first
large-scale benchmark suite tailored for realistic constellation scheduling.
Building upon this benchmark, we introduce AEOS-Former, a Transformer-based
scheduling model that incorporates a constraint-aware attention mechanism. A
dedicated internal constraint module explicitly models the physical and
operational limits of each satellite. Through simulation-based iterative
learning, AEOS-Former adapts to diverse scenarios, offering a robust solution
for AEOS constellation scheduling. Experimental results demonstrate that
AEOS-Former outperforms baseline models in task completion and energy
efficiency, with ablation studies highlighting the contribution of each

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于证据理论的融合范式，有效整合CNN和ViT两种骨干网络的特征，以提升糖尿病视网膜病变分级的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 糖尿病视网膜病变是导致中老年人视力丧失的主要原因，现有基于单一类型骨干网络（CNN或ViT）的诊断系统性能已达瓶颈，需要融合不同骨干网络的优势来进一步提升性能。

Method: 提出基于证据理论的融合范式，通过一组深度证据网络将不同骨干网络提取的特征转换为支持证据，形成聚合意见来自适应调整融合模式。

Result: 在两个公开的糖尿病视网膜病变分级数据集上的实验结果表明，该混合模型不仅提高了分级准确性，还提供了优秀的特征融合和决策可解释性。

Conclusion: 基于证据理论的融合方法能够有效整合CNN和ViT的优势，在糖尿病视网膜病变诊断中实现性能提升和可解释性增强。

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss among middle-aged
and elderly people, which significantly impacts their daily lives and mental
health. To improve the efficiency of clinical screening and enable the early
detection of DR, a variety of automated DR diagnosis systems have been recently
established based on convolutional neural network (CNN) or vision Transformer
(ViT). However, due to the own shortages of CNN / ViT, the performance of
existing methods using single-type backbone has reached a bottleneck. One
potential way for the further improvements is integrating different kinds of
backbones, which can fully leverage the respective strengths of them
(\emph{i.e.,} the local feature extraction capability of CNN and the global
feature capturing ability of ViT). To this end, we propose a novel paradigm to
effectively fuse the features extracted by different backbones based on the
theory of evidence. Specifically, the proposed evidential fusion paradigm
transforms the features from different backbones into supporting evidences via
a set of deep evidential networks. With the supporting evidences, the
aggregated opinion can be accordingly formed, which can be used to adaptively
tune the fusion pattern between different backbones and accordingly boost the
performance of our hybrid model. We evaluated our method on two publicly
available DR grading datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our
hybrid model not only improves the accuracy of DR grading, compared to the
state-of-the-art frameworks, but also provides the excellent interpretability
for feature fusion and decision-making.

### [42] [GLYPH-SR: Can We Achieve Both High-Quality Image Super-Resolution and High-Fidelity Text Recovery via VLM-guided Latent Diffusion Model?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26339)
*Mingyu Sung,Seungjae Ham,Kangwoo Kim,Yeokyoung Yoon,Sangseok Yun,Il-Min Kim,Jae-Mo Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLYPH-SR是一个视觉语言引导的扩散框架，专门针对场景文本超分辨率，同时优化文本可读性和感知质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有超分辨率研究主要关注失真度或感知指标，但对字符级错误不敏感。场景文本（如标志、产品标签）包含最关键信息，但现有方法往往将其视为普通纹理处理，导致OCR识别失败。

Method: 使用文本-SR融合控制网络（TS-ControlNet）结合OCR数据指导，采用乒乓调度器在文本中心和场景中心指导之间交替，在合成语料库上训练这些组件，同时保持主要SR分支冻结。

Result: 在SVT、SCUT-CTW1500和CUTE80数据集上，4倍和8倍超分辨率下，GLYPH-SR相比扩散/GAN基线将OCR F1分数提高了最高15.18个百分点，同时保持竞争力的MANIQA、CLIP-IQA和MUSIQ分数。

Conclusion: GLYPH-SR能够同时实现高可读性和高视觉真实感，提供既看起来正确又能正确阅读的超分辨率结果。

Abstract: Image super-resolution(SR) is fundamental to many vision system-from
surveillance and autonomy to document analysis and retail analytics-because
recovering high-frequency details, especially scene-text, enables reliable
downstream perception. Scene-text, i.e., text embedded in natural images such
as signs, product labels, and storefronts, often carries the most actionable
information; when characters are blurred or hallucinated, optical character
recognition(OCR) and subsequent decisions fail even if the rest of the image
appears sharp. Yet previous SR research has often been tuned to distortion
(PSNR/SSIM) or learned perceptual metrics (LIPIS, MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, MUSIQ) that
are largely insensitive to character-level errors. Furthermore, studies that do
address text SR often focus on simplified benchmarks with isolated characters,
overlooking the challenges of text within complex natural scenes. As a result,
scene-text is effectively treated as generic texture. For SR to be effective in
practical deployments, it is therefore essential to explicitly optimize for
both text legibility and perceptual quality. We present GLYPH-SR, a
vision-language-guided diffusion framework that aims to achieve both objectives
jointly. GLYPH-SR utilizes a Text-SR Fusion ControlNet(TS-ControlNet) guided by
OCR data, and a ping-pong scheduler that alternates between text- and
scene-centric guidance. To enable targeted text restoration, we train these
components on a synthetic corpus while keeping the main SR branch frozen.
Across SVT, SCUT-CTW1500, and CUTE80 at x4, and x8, GLYPH-SR improves OCR F1 by
up to +15.18 percentage points over diffusion/GAN baseline (SVT x8, OpenOCR)
while maintaining competitive MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, and MUSIQ. GLYPH-SR is designed
to satisfy both objectives simultaneously-high readability and high visual
realism-delivering SR that looks right and reds right.

*Igor Abramov,Ilya Makarov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合EEG嵌入和空间显著性图的双条件框架，通过ATM提取EEG特征，使用LoRA微调Stable Diffusion 2.1，并利用ControlNet进行空间控制，显著提升了EEG驱动图像重建的质量和语义一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的EEG驱动图像重建方法往往忽视空间注意力机制，导致重建图像的保真度和语义连贯性受限。

Method: 使用自适应思维映射器(ATM)提取EEG特征，通过低秩适应(LoRA)微调Stable Diffusion 2.1来对齐神经信号与视觉语义，同时利用ControlNet分支基于显著性图进行空间控制生成。

Result: 在THINGS-EEG数据集上的评估显示，该方法在低层和高层图像特征质量上显著优于现有方法，同时与人类视觉注意力高度对齐。

Conclusion: 注意力先验能够解决EEG的歧义性，实现高保真重建，在医学诊断和神经自适应接口中有应用前景，通过预训练扩散模型的高效适应推动了神经解码技术的发展。

Abstract: Existing EEG-driven image reconstruction methods often overlook spatial
attention mechanisms, limiting fidelity and semantic coherence. To address
this, we propose a dual-conditioning framework that combines EEG embeddings
with spatial saliency maps to enhance image generation. Our approach leverages
the Adaptive Thinking Mapper (ATM) for EEG feature extraction and fine-tunes
Stable Diffusion 2.1 via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to align neural signals
with visual semantics, while a ControlNet branch conditions generation on
saliency maps for spatial control. Evaluated on THINGS-EEG, our method achieves
a significant improvement in the quality of low- and high-level image features
over existing approaches. Simultaneously, strongly aligning with human visual
attention. The results demonstrate that attentional priors resolve EEG
ambiguities, enabling high-fidelity reconstructions with applications in
medical diagnostics and neuroadaptive interfaces, advancing neural decoding
through efficient adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了LoCoT2V-Bench基准，专门用于评估复杂输入条件下的长视频生成，包含现实复杂提示语和多维度评估框架，发现现有方法在事件间一致性、细粒度对齐和高级主题遵循方面存在不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频生成评估主要依赖简化提示语和低层次指标，忽视了与提示语的细粒度对齐以及叙事连贯性、主题表达等抽象维度，需要专门针对长视频复杂生成的评估基准。

Method: 基于真实视频构建包含场景转换和事件动态的现实复杂提示语，建立多维度评估框架，包括新提出的指标：事件级对齐、细粒度时间一致性、内容清晰度以及关注叙事流程、情感响应和角色发展的人类期望实现度(HERD)。

Result: 对9个代表性长视频生成模型进行全面评估，发现现有方法在基础视觉和时间方面表现良好，但在事件间一致性、细粒度对齐和高级主题遵循等方面存在困难。

Conclusion: LoCoT2V-Bench为长格式复杂文本到视频生成提供了全面可靠的评估平台，并指出了未来方法改进的关键方向。

Abstract: Recently text-to-video generation has made impressive progress in producing
short, high-quality clips, but evaluating long-form outputs remains a major
challenge especially when processing complex prompts. Existing benchmarks
mostly rely on simplified prompts and focus on low-level metrics, overlooking
fine-grained alignment with prompts and abstract dimensions such as narrative
coherence and thematic expression. To address these gaps, we propose
LoCoT2V-Bench, a benchmark specifically designed for long video generation
(LVG) under complex input conditions. Based on various real-world videos,
LoCoT2V-Bench introduces a suite of realistic and complex prompts incorporating
elements like scene transitions and event dynamics. Moreover, it constructs a
multi-dimensional evaluation framework that includes our newly proposed metrics
such as event-level alignment, fine-grained temporal consistency, content
clarity, and the Human Expectation Realization Degree (HERD) that focuses on
more abstract attributes like narrative flow, emotional response, and character
development. Using this framework, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
nine representative LVG models, finding that while current methods perform well
on basic visual and temporal aspects, they struggle with inter-event
consistency, fine-grained alignment, and high-level thematic adherence, etc.
Overall, LoCoT2V-Bench provides a comprehensive and reliable platform for
evaluating long-form complex text-to-video generation and highlights critical
directions for future method improvement.

*Shihab Aaqil Ahamed,Udaya S. K. P. Miriya Thanthrige,Ranga Rodrigo,Muhammad Haris Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了A-TPT框架，通过引入角度多样性来改善视觉语言模型在测试时提示调优中的校准性能，通过最大化单位超球面上特征之间的最小成对角度距离来实现均匀分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时提示调优方法主要关注最大化平均文本特征分散度或施加正交约束，但可能无法实现最优的角度分离，忽略了角度多样性的关键作用，这会影响模型的校准性能和可靠性。

Method: 提出A-TPT框架，通过最大化归一化文本特征在单位超球面上的最小成对角度距离，鼓励学习提示诱导的文本特征分布的均匀性，从而提高角度多样性。

Result: 在各种骨干网络和数据集上的广泛实验表明，A-TPT在减少聚合平均校准误差方面持续优于最先进的TPT方法，同时保持相当的准确性，在自然分布偏移和医学数据集上表现出优越的零样本校准性能。

Conclusion: 促进角度多样性是实现良好分散文本特征的有效方法，显著改善了视觉语言模型在测试时适应过程中的校准性能，为模型可靠性提供了重要保障。

Abstract: Test-time prompt tuning (TPT) has emerged as a promising technique for
adapting large vision-language models (VLMs) to unseen tasks without relying on
labeled data. However, the lack of dispersion between textual features can hurt
calibration performance, which raises concerns about VLMs' reliability,
trustworthiness, and safety. Current TPT approaches primarily focus on
improving prompt calibration by either maximizing average textual feature
dispersion or enforcing orthogonality constraints to encourage angular
separation. However, these methods may not always have optimal angular
separation between class-wise textual features, which implies overlooking the
critical role of angular diversity. To address this, we propose A-TPT, a novel
TPT framework that introduces angular diversity to encourage uniformity in the
distribution of normalized textual features induced by corresponding learnable
prompts. This uniformity is achieved by maximizing the minimum pairwise angular
distance between features on the unit hypersphere. We show that our approach
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art TPT methods in reducing the aggregate
average calibration error while maintaining comparable accuracy through
extensive experiments with various backbones on different datasets. Notably,
our approach exhibits superior zero-shot calibration performance on natural
distribution shifts and generalizes well to medical datasets. We provide
extensive analyses, including theoretical aspects, to establish the grounding
of A-TPT. These results highlight the potency of promoting angular diversity to
achieve well-dispersed textual features, significantly improving VLM
calibration during test-time adaptation. Our code will be made publicly
available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出PointSt3R方法，通过3D基础对应关系将DUSt3R和MASt3R等3D重建模型适配用于点跟踪任务，在多个数据集上取得了竞争性或更优的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用基础3D重建模型在静态场景中的2D和3D对应能力，将其扩展到动态点跟踪任务，解决现有方法在动态点跟踪上的局限性。

Method: 结合重建损失与动态对应训练，添加可见性头部，使用少量合成数据对MASt3R进行微调，仅使用包含查询点的帧对进行训练和评估。

Result: 在四个数据集上取得竞争性或更优结果：TAP-Vid-DAVIS上73.8 δ_avg/85.8%遮挡准确率，EgoPoints上61.3 vs 54.2，RGB-S上87.0 vs 82.8，显著优于CoTracker3。

Conclusion: 通过3D基础对应关系的方法能够有效解决点跟踪问题，在动态和静态点跟踪任务中都表现出色，证明了基础3D重建模型在点跟踪任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in foundational 3D reconstruction models, such as DUSt3R and
MASt3R, have shown great potential in 2D and 3D correspondence in static
scenes. In this paper, we propose to adapt them for the task of point tracking
through 3D grounded correspondence. We first demonstrate that these models are
competitive point trackers when focusing on static points, present in current
point tracking benchmarks ($+33.5\%$ on EgoPoints vs. CoTracker2). We propose
to combine the reconstruction loss with training for dynamic correspondence
along with a visibility head, and fine-tuning MASt3R for point tracking using a
relatively small amount of synthetic data. Importantly, we only train and
evaluate on pairs of frames where one contains the query point, effectively
removing any temporal context. Using a mix of dynamic and static point
correspondences, we achieve competitive or superior point tracking results on
four datasets (e.g. competitive on TAP-Vid-DAVIS 73.8 $\delta_{avg}$ / 85.8\%
occlusion acc. for PointSt3R compared to 75.7 / 88.3\% for CoTracker2; and
significantly outperform CoTracker3 on EgoPoints 61.3 vs 54.2 and RGB-S 87.0 vs
82.8). We also present results on 3D point tracking along with several
ablations on training datasets and percentage of dynamic correspondences.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了FineGrainedAD框架，通过多级细粒度语义描述来解决少样本异常检测中的语义对齐问题，在MVTec-AD和VisA数据集上取得了优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的少样本异常检测方法依赖预训练视觉语言模型，但由于缺乏详细文本描述，只能使用图像级描述来匹配视觉补丁，导致图像描述与补丁级视觉异常之间的语义不对齐，定位性能不佳。

Method: 提出了多级细粒度语义描述(MFSC)为异常检测数据集提供多级细粒度文本描述，并设计了FineGrainedAD框架，包含多级可学习提示(MLLP)和多级语义对齐(MLSA)两个组件。MLLP通过自动替换和拼接机制将细粒度语义引入多级可学习提示，MLSA设计区域聚合策略和多级对齐训练来促进可学习提示与对应视觉区域的对齐。

Result: 实验表明，在MVTec-AD和VisA数据集的少样本设置下，FineGrainedAD实现了优越的整体性能。

Conclusion: 通过引入多级细粒度语义描述和相应的对齐机制，有效解决了少样本异常检测中的语义对齐问题，显著提升了异常定位性能。

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD) methods identify anomalous regions with few
known normal samples. Most existing methods rely on the generalization ability
of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to recognize potentially anomalous
regions through feature similarity between text descriptions and images.
However, due to the lack of detailed textual descriptions, these methods can
only pre-define image-level descriptions to match each visual patch token to
identify potential anomalous regions, which leads to the semantic misalignment
between image descriptions and patch-level visual anomalies, achieving
sub-optimal localization performance. To address the above issues, we propose
the Multi-Level Fine-Grained Semantic Caption (MFSC) to provide multi-level and
fine-grained textual descriptions for existing anomaly detection datasets with
automatic construction pipeline. Based on the MFSC, we propose a novel
framework named FineGrainedAD to improve anomaly localization performance,
which consists of two components: Multi-Level Learnable Prompt (MLLP) and
Multi-Level Semantic Alignment (MLSA). MLLP introduces fine-grained semantics
into multi-level learnable prompts through automatic replacement and
concatenation mechanism, while MLSA designs region aggregation strategy and
multi-level alignment training to facilitate learnable prompts better align
with corresponding visual regions. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed
FineGrainedAD achieves superior overall performance in few-shot settings on
MVTec-AD and VisA datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于因果推理的零样本方法，通过合成反事实嵌入来缓解视觉语言模型中的对象-上下文关联偏差问题，无需重新训练即可提升模型在上下文敏感任务中的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型中对象-上下文关联偏差问题，这种偏差会降低模型在测试场景与训练共现模式不同时的零样本可靠性。

Method: 将问题重构为因果推理问题，在CLIP表示空间中估计对象和背景期望，通过重新组合对象特征与来自外部数据集、批次邻居或文本描述的多样化替代上下文来合成反事实嵌入，并利用总直接效应估计和干预模拟来减去背景激活。

Result: 无需重新训练或提示设计，在上下文敏感基准测试中显著改善了最差组和平均准确率，建立了新的零样本最先进水平。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种轻量级的表示级反事实方法，为去偏和可靠的多模态推理提供了一条实用的因果途径。

Abstract: Object-context shortcuts remain a persistent challenge in vision-language
models, undermining zero-shot reliability when test-time scenes differ from
familiar training co-occurrences. We recast this issue as a causal inference
problem and ask: Would the prediction remain if the object appeared in a
different environment? To answer this at inference time, we estimate object and
background expectations within CLIP's representation space, and synthesize
counterfactual embeddings by recombining object features with diverse
alternative contexts sampled from external datasets, batch neighbors, or
text-derived descriptions. By estimating the Total Direct Effect and simulating
intervention, we further subtract background-only activation, preserving
beneficial object-context interactions while mitigating hallucinated scores.
Without retraining or prompt design, our method substantially improves both
worst-group and average accuracy on context-sensitive benchmarks, establishing
a new zero-shot state of the art. Beyond performance, our framework provides a
lightweight representation-level counterfactual approach, offering a practical
causal avenue for debiased and reliable multimodal reasoning.

Conclusion: 通过解决自改进过程中的马太效应问题，提出的头尾重新平衡策略能有效提升模型的视觉推理能力，突破性能瓶颈。

Abstract: Self-improvement has emerged as a mainstream paradigm for advancing the
reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs), where models
explore and learn from successful trajectories iteratively. However, we
identify a critical issue during this process: the model excels at generating
high-quality trajectories for simple queries (i.e., head data) but struggles
with more complex ones (i.e., tail data). This leads to an imbalanced
optimization that drives the model to prioritize simple reasoning skills, while
hindering its ability to tackle more complex reasoning tasks. Over iterations,
this imbalance becomes increasingly pronounced--a dynamic we term the "Matthew
effect"--which ultimately hinders further model improvement and leads to
performance bottlenecks. To counteract this challenge, we introduce four
efficient strategies from two perspectives: distribution-reshaping and
trajectory-resampling, to achieve head-tail re-balancing during the
exploration-and-learning self-improvement process. Extensive experiments on
Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct and InternVL2.5-4B models across visual reasoning tasks
demonstrate that our methods consistently improve visual reasoning
capabilities, outperforming vanilla self-improvement by 3.86 points on average.

Abstract: The edge detection task is essential in image processing aiming to extract
relevant information from an image. One recurring problem in this task is the
weaknesses found in some detectors, such as the difficulty in detecting loose
edges and the lack of context to extract relevant information from specific
problems. To address these weaknesses and adapt the detector to the properties
of an image, an adaptable detector described by two-dimensional cellular
automaton and optimized by meta-heuristic combined with transfer learning
techniques was developed. This study aims to analyze the impact of expanding
the search space of the optimization phase and the robustness of the
adaptability of the detector in identifying edges of a set of natural images
and specialized subsets extracted from the same image set. The results obtained
prove that expanding the search space of the optimization phase was not
effective for the chosen image set. The study also analyzed the adaptability of
the model through a series of experiments and validation techniques and found
that, regardless of the validation, the model was able to adapt to the input
and the transfer learning techniques applied to the model showed no significant
improvements.

Abstract: Spine segmentation, based on ultrasound volume projection imaging (VPI),
plays a vital role for intelligent scoliosis diagnosis in clinical
applications. However, this task faces several significant challenges. Firstly,
the global contextual knowledge of spines may not be well-learned if we neglect
the high spatial correlation of different bone features. Secondly, the spine
bones contain rich structural knowledge regarding their shapes and positions,
which deserves to be encoded into the segmentation process. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel scale-adaptive structure-aware network
(SA$^{2}$Net) for effective spine segmentation. First, we propose a
scale-adaptive complementary strategy to learn the cross-dimensional
long-distance correlation features for spinal images. Second, motivated by the
consistency between multi-head self-attention in Transformers and semantic
level affinity, we propose structure-affinity transformation to transform
semantic features with class-specific affinity and combine it with a
Transformer decoder for structure-aware reasoning. In addition, we adopt a
feature mixing loss aggregation method to enhance model training. This method
improves the robustness and accuracy of the segmentation process. The
experimental results demonstrate that our SA$^{2}$Net achieves superior
segmentation performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Moreover,
the adaptability of SA$^{2}$Net to various backbones enhances its potential as
a promising tool for advanced scoliosis diagnosis using intelligent spinal
image analysis. The code and experimental demo are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统广告剪辑需要手动从长视频广告中选择和重新编辑镜头来创建短版本，过程劳动密集且耗时。

Method: 开发了一个双流音视频融合模型来预测视频帧的重要性，重要性定义为帧在公司制作的短广告中被选中的可能性。

Conclusion: 该框架通过自动化视频广告剪辑过程，显著提高了效率，并证明了音频在广告剪辑中的重要性。

Abstract: Advertisers commonly need multiple versions of the same advertisement (ad) at
varying durations for a single campaign. The traditional approach involves
manually selecting and re-editing shots from longer video ads to create shorter
versions, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we
introduce a framework for automated video ad clipping using video summarization
techniques. We are the first to frame video clipping as a shot selection
problem, tailored specifically for advertising. Unlike existing general video
summarization methods that primarily focus on visual content, our approach
emphasizes the critical role of audio in advertising. To achieve this, we
develop a two-stream audio-visual fusion model that predicts the importance of
video frames, where importance is defined as the likelihood of a frame being
selected in the firm-produced short ad. To address the lack of ad-specific
datasets, we present AdSum204, a novel dataset comprising 102 pairs of
30-second and 15-second ads from real advertising campaigns. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across various metrics, including Average Precision, Area Under Curve,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态上下文感知场景推理框架，利用视觉-语言对齐来解决零样本现实场景理解问题，在未见环境中实现18%的准确率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实环境中AI系统经常面临没有标注数据的陌生场景，传统场景理解模型难以泛化到未见上下文，限制了视觉应用在动态、非结构化环境中的部署。

Method: 集成预训练视觉变换器和大型语言模型，将视觉语义与自然语言描述对齐，通过动态推理模块结合全局场景线索和对象级交互，并利用语言先验指导。

Result: 在COCO、Visual Genome和Open Images等零样本基准测试中，场景理解准确率相比基线模型提升高达18%，在模糊或杂乱场景中表现出鲁棒性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为上下文感知推理提供了可扩展和可解释的方法，推动了动态现实环境中零样本泛化的进展。

Abstract: In real-world environments, AI systems often face unfamiliar scenarios
without labeled data, creating a major challenge for conventional scene
understanding models. The inability to generalize across unseen contexts limits
the deployment of vision-based applications in dynamic, unstructured settings.
This work introduces a Dynamic Context-Aware Scene Reasoning framework that
leverages Vision-Language Alignment to address zero-shot real-world scenarios.
The goal is to enable intelligent systems to infer and adapt to new
environments without prior task-specific training. The proposed approach
integrates pre-trained vision transformers and large language models to align
visual semantics with natural language descriptions, enhancing contextual
comprehension. A dynamic reasoning module refines predictions by combining
global scene cues and object-level interactions guided by linguistic priors.
Extensive experiments on zero-shot benchmarks such as COCO, Visual Genome, and
Open Images demonstrate up to 18% improvement in scene understanding accuracy
over baseline models in complex and unseen environments. Results also show
robust performance in ambiguous or cluttered scenes due to the synergistic
fusion of vision and language. This framework offers a scalable and
interpretable approach for context-aware reasoning, advancing zero-shot
generalization in dynamic real-world settings.

*Xinjin Li,Yulie Lu,Jinghan Cao,Yu Ma,Zhenglin Li,Yeyang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CATCH是一个即插即用的跨域适应框架，通过解耦视觉和语言适应，使用轻量级域分类器和双适配器机制，在不重新训练主干模型的情况下提升VQA模型在多个领域的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA模型在自然图像领域表现优异，但在遥感、医疗、数学图表等跨域场景中泛化能力显著下降。传统方法依赖针对每个领域的微调或定制化流程，成本高、灵活性差且难以扩展。

Method: 提出CATCH框架，包含域分类器和双适配器机制（提示适配器和视觉适配器），通过统一钩子接口动态注入，无需重新训练主干模型。

Result: 在四个领域特定的VQA基准测试中均取得性能提升：MathVQA上BLEU提升2.3，MedVQA-RAD上VQA得分提升2.6，ChartQA上ROUGE提升3.1。

Conclusion: CATCH提供了一种可扩展和可扩展的多域VQA方法，能够在不同应用领域中实现实际部署。

Abstract: Recent advances in Visual Question Answering (VQA) have demonstrated
impressive performance in natural image domains, with models like LLaVA
leveraging large language models (LLMs) for open-ended reasoning. However,
their generalization degrades significantly when transferred to out-of-domain
scenarios such as remote sensing, medical imaging, or math diagrams, due to
large distributional shifts and the lack of effective domain adaptation
mechanisms. Existing approaches typically rely on per-domain fine-tuning or
bespoke pipelines, which are costly, inflexible, and not scalable across
diverse tasks. In this paper, we propose CATCH, a plug-and-play framework for
cross-domain adaptation that improves the generalization of VQA models while
requiring minimal changes to their core architecture. Our key idea is to
decouple visual and linguistic adaptation by introducing two lightweight
modules: a domain classifier to identify the input image type, and a dual
adapter mechanism comprising a Prompt Adapter for language modulation and a
Visual Adapter for vision feature adjustment. Both modules are dynamically
injected via a unified hook interface, requiring no retraining of the backbone
model. Experimental results across four domain-specific VQA benchmarks
demonstrate that our framework achieves consistent performance gains without
retraining the backbone model, including +2.3 BLEU on MathVQA, +2.6 VQA on
MedVQA-RAD, and +3.1 ROUGE on ChartQA. These results highlight that CATCH
provides a scalable and extensible approach to multi-domain VQA, enabling
practical deployment across diverse application domains.

Abstract: We introduce Emu3.5, a large-scale multimodal world model that natively
predicts the next state across vision and language. Emu3.5 is pre-trained
end-to-end with a unified next-token prediction objective on a corpus of
vision-language interleaved data containing over 10 trillion tokens, primarily
derived from sequential frames and transcripts of internet videos. The model
naturally accepts interleaved vision-language inputs and generates interleaved
vision-language outputs. Emu3.5 is further post-trained with large-scale
reinforcement learning to enhance multimodal reasoning and generation. To
improve inference efficiency, we propose Discrete Diffusion Adaptation (DiDA),
which converts token-by-token decoding into bidirectional parallel prediction,
accelerating per-image inference by about 20x without sacrificing performance.
Emu3.5 exhibits strong native multimodal capabilities, including long-horizon
vision-language generation, any-to-image (X2I) generation, and complex
text-rich image generation. It also exhibits generalizable world-modeling
abilities, enabling spatiotemporally consistent world exploration and
open-world embodied manipulation across diverse scenarios and tasks. For
comparison, Emu3.5 achieves performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Flash Image
(Nano Banana) on image generation and editing tasks and demonstrates superior
results on a suite of interleaved generation tasks. We open-source Emu3.5 at
https://github.com/baaivision/Emu3.5 to support community research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ResMatching是一种新的计算超分辨率方法，使用引导条件流匹配学习改进的数据先验，在BioSR数据集上相比7个基线方法表现优异，特别是在噪声多的低分辨率图像中效果突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算超分辨率在荧光显微镜中是一个不适定问题，核心在于找到能够外推显微镜未成像频率的先验。随着数据驱动的机器学习技术发展，可以学习更强的先验来获得更好的超分辨率结果。

Method: 使用引导条件流匹配来学习改进的数据先验，能够从隐式学习的后验分布中采样，并提供像素级的数据不确定性估计。

Result: 在BioSR数据集的4种不同生物结构上评估，ResMatching在所有情况下都实现了数据保真度和感知真实性的最佳权衡，特别是在噪声多的低分辨率图像中表现优异。

Conclusion: ResMatching在计算超分辨率中表现出色，特别是在学习强先验困难的情况下，能够提供校准的后验分布和像素级不确定性估计，指导用户拒绝不确定的预测。

Abstract: Computational Super-Resolution (CSR) in fluorescence microscopy has, despite
being an ill-posed problem, a long history. At its very core, CSR is about
finding a prior that can be used to extrapolate frequencies in a micrograph
that have never been imaged by the image-generating microscope. It stands to
reason that, with the advent of better data-driven machine learning techniques,
stronger prior can be learned and hence CSR can lead to better results. Here,
we present ResMatching, a novel CSR method that uses guided conditional flow
matching to learn such improved data-priors. We evaluate ResMatching on 4
diverse biological structures from the BioSR dataset and compare its results
against 7 baselines. ResMatching consistently achieves competitive results,
demonstrating in all cases the best trade-off between data fidelity and
perceptual realism. We observe that CSR using ResMatching is particularly
effective in cases where a strong prior is hard to learn, e.g. when the given
low-resolution images contain a lot of noise. Additionally, we show that
ResMatching can be used to sample from an implicitly learned posterior
distribution and that this distribution is calibrated for all tested use-cases,
enabling our method to deliver a pixel-wise data-uncertainty term that can
guide future users to reject uncertain predictions.

Abstract: Accurate and timely crop yield prediction is crucial for global food security
and modern agricultural management. Traditional methods often lack the
scalability and granularity required for precision farming. This paper
introduces CYPRESS (Crop Yield Prediction via Regression on Prithvi's Encoder
for Satellite Sensing), a deep learning model designed for high-resolution,
intra-field canola yield prediction. CYPRESS leverages a pre-trained,
large-scale geospatial foundation model (Prithvi-EO-2.0-600M) and adapts it for
a continuous regression task, transforming multi-temporal satellite imagery
into dense, pixel-level yield maps. Evaluated on a comprehensive dataset from
the Canadian Prairies, CYPRESS demonstrates superior performance over existing
deep learning-based yield prediction models, highlighting the effectiveness of
fine-tuning foundation models for specialized agricultural applications. By
providing a continuous, high-resolution output, CYPRESS offers a more
actionable tool for precision agriculture than conventional classification or
county-level aggregation methods. This work validates a novel approach that
bridges the gap between large-scale Earth observation and on-farm
decision-making, offering a scalable solution for detailed agricultural
monitoring.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种专门为事件相机设计的标记化方法Spiking Patches，能够保持事件的异步性和空间稀疏性，同时实现比体素和帧表示更快的推理速度，在精度上相当甚至更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的事件表示方法（帧或体素）虽然精度高，但破坏了事件相机的异步性和空间稀疏性特性。需要一种能够保持这些独特属性的新表示方法。

Method: 提出Spiking Patches标记化方法，将异步稀疏事件流转换为标记，使用GNN、PCN和Transformer在姿态识别和物体检测任务上评估。

Result: Spiking Patches标记比体素标记推理速度快3.4倍，比帧表示快10.4倍，在精度上相当甚至更好（姿态识别提升3.8%，物体检测提升1.4%）。

Conclusion: 标记化为事件视觉提供了新方向，是朝着保持事件相机特性的方法迈出的重要一步。

Abstract: We propose tokenization of events and present a tokenizer, Spiking Patches,
specifically designed for event cameras. Given a stream of asynchronous and
spatially sparse events, our goal is to discover an event representation that
preserves these properties. Prior works have represented events as frames or as
voxels. However, while these representations yield high accuracy, both frames
and voxels are synchronous and decrease the spatial sparsity. Spiking Patches
gives the means to preserve the unique properties of event cameras and we show
in our experiments that this comes without sacrificing accuracy. We evaluate
our tokenizer using a GNN, PCN, and a Transformer on gesture recognition and
object detection. Tokens from Spiking Patches yield inference times that are up
to 3.4x faster than voxel-based tokens and up to 10.4x faster than frames. We
achieve this while matching their accuracy and even surpassing in some cases
with absolute improvements up to 3.8 for gesture recognition and up to 1.4 for
object detection. Thus, tokenization constitutes a novel direction in
event-based vision and marks a step towards methods that preserve the
properties of event cameras.

Abstract: To address the challenges in UAV object detection, such as complex
backgrounds, severe occlusion, dense small objects, and varying lighting
conditions,this paper proposes PT-DETR based on RT-DETR, a novel detection
algorithm specifically designed for small objects in UAV imagery. In the
backbone network, we introduce the Partially-Aware Detail Focus (PADF) Module

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are transforming the future of transportation
through advances in intelligent perception, decision-making, and control
systems. However, their success is tied to one core capability, reliable object
detection in complex and multimodal environments. While recent breakthroughs in
Computer Vision (CV) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have driven remarkable
progress, the field still faces a critical challenge as knowledge remains
fragmented across multimodal perception, contextual reasoning, and cooperative
intelligence. This survey bridges that gap by delivering a forward-looking
analysis of object detection in AVs, emphasizing emerging paradigms such as
Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Generative AI
rather than re-examining outdated techniques. We begin by systematically
reviewing the fundamental spectrum of AV sensors (camera, ultrasonic, LiDAR,
and Radar) and their fusion strategies, highlighting not only their
capabilities and limitations in dynamic driving environments but also their
potential to integrate with recent advances in LLM/VLM-driven perception
frameworks. Next, we introduce a structured categorization of AV datasets that
moves beyond simple collections, positioning ego-vehicle, infrastructure-based,
and cooperative datasets (e.g., V2V, V2I, V2X, I2I), followed by a
cross-analysis of data structures and characteristics. Ultimately, we analyze
cutting-edge detection methodologies, ranging from 2D and 3D pipelines to
hybrid sensor fusion, with particular attention to emerging transformer-driven
approaches powered by Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large and Small Language
Models (SLMs), and VLMs. By synthesizing these perspectives, our survey
delivers a clear roadmap of current capabilities, open challenges, and future
opportunities.

TL;DR: 首次大规模评估48个深度学习光流模型在RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR海冰图像上的表现，多个模型达到亚公里级精度，证明深度学习光流方法可有效应用于极地遥感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确估计海冰漂移对北极航行、气候研究和业务预报至关重要，但传统光流方法在复杂场景中精度有限，而深度学习光流方法在计算机视觉领域取得显著进展，其在地球物理问题和卫星SAR图像中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用48个深度学习光流模型处理RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR海冰图像，通过端点误差(EPE)和Fl指标与GNSS跟踪浮标数据进行评估。

Result: 多个模型达到亚公里级精度(EPE 6-8像素，300-400米)，相对于海冰运动空间尺度和北极典型航行需求而言误差较小，模型能够捕捉一致的区域漂移模式。

Conclusion: 深度学习光流方法相比传统方法显著提高了运动估计精度，可有效迁移到极地遥感中，提供空间连续的漂移场，为导航和气候建模提供新机遇。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of sea ice drift is critical for Arctic navigation,
climate research, and operational forecasting. While optical flow, a computer
vision technique for estimating pixel wise motion between consecutive images,
has advanced rapidly in computer vision, its applicability to geophysical
problems and to satellite SAR imagery remains underexplored. Classical optical
flow methods rely on mathematical models and strong assumptions about motion,
which limit their accuracy in complex scenarios. Recent deep learning based
approaches have substantially improved performance and are now the standard in
computer vision, motivating their application to sea ice drift estimation. We
present the first large scale benchmark of 48 deep learning optical flow models
on RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR sea ice imagery, evaluated with endpoint error (EPE) and
Fl all metrics against GNSS tracked buoys. Several models achieve sub kilometer
accuracy (EPE 6 to 8 pixels, 300 to 400 m), a small error relative to the
spatial scales of sea ice motion and typical navigation requirements in the
Arctic. Our results demonstrate that the models are capable of capturing
consistent regional drift patterns and that recent deep learning based optical
flow methods, which have substantially improved motion estimation accuracy
compared to classical methods, can be effectively transferred to polar remote
sensing. Optical flow produces spatially continuous drift fields, providing
motion estimates for every image pixel rather than at sparse buoy locations,
offering new opportunities for navigation and climate modeling.

Motivation: 遮挡问题给目标识别算法带来重大挑战，场景上下文信息在生物视觉中已被证明有助于目标识别，因此希望通过融合场景信息来增强现有目标检测网络对遮挡的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出两种场景信息融合技术：1）预测前基于识别出的背景场景选择定制化的目标网络；2）检测后将场景知识融合到RPN输出的初始目标分数中。

Result: 在具有部分遮挡的挑战性数据集上，相比基线方法在召回率和精确率方面都有整体提升。实验还发现，在遮挡和非遮挡图像组合上训练比单独训练效果更好。

Conclusion: 该方法具有可解释性，易于适应其他数据集，为未来研究和实际应用提供了多个发展方向。

Abstract: The presence of occlusions has provided substantial challenges to
typically-powerful object recognition algorithms. Additional sources of
information can be extremely valuable to reduce errors caused by occlusions.
Scene context is known to aid in object recognition in biological vision. In
this work, we attempt to add robustness into existing Region Proposal
Network-Deep Convolutional Neural Network (RPN-DCNN) object detection networks
through two distinct scene-based information fusion techniques. We present one
algorithm under each methodology: the first operates prior to prediction,
selecting a custom object network to use based on the identified background
scene, and the second operates after detection, fusing scene knowledge into
initial object scores output by the RPN. We demonstrate our algorithms on
challenging datasets featuring partial occlusions, which show overall
improvement in both recall and precision against baseline methods. In addition,
our experiments contrast multiple training methodologies for occlusion
handling, finding that training on a combination of both occluded and
unoccluded images demonstrates an improvement over the others. Our method is
interpretable and can easily be adapted to other datasets, offering many future
directions for research and practical applications.

Motivation: 开发一种能够在推理时对视觉语言模型进行精细控制的方法，使模型输出更好地符合期望指令，同时保持非目标任务性能。

Method: 从编码目标行为和相反行为的配对提示的潜在嵌入中学习，通过维度激活调制和跨层自适应导向来动态调整激活连接。

Result: 该方法在导向和幻觉缓解基准测试中优于现有干预技术，导向模块参数仅占原始VLM大小的0.14%。

Conclusion: SteerVLM通过激活工程为多模态模型控制提供了稳健解决方案，并引入了专门用于VLM导向技术开发和评估的VNIA数据集。

Abstract: This work introduces SteerVLM, a lightweight steering module designed to
guide Vision-Language Models (VLMs) towards outputs that better adhere to
desired instructions. Our approach learns from the latent embeddings of paired
prompts encoding target and converse behaviors to dynamically adjust
activations connecting the language modality with image context. This allows
for fine-grained, inference-time control over complex output semantics without
modifying model weights while preserving performance on off-target tasks. Our
steering module requires learning parameters equal to 0.14% of the original
VLM's size. Our steering module gains model control through dimension-wise
activation modulation and adaptive steering across layers without requiring
pre-extracted static vectors or manual tuning of intervention points.
Furthermore, we introduce VNIA (Visual Narrative Intent Alignment), a
multimodal dataset specifically created to facilitate the development and
evaluation of VLM steering techniques. Our method outperforms existing
intervention techniques on steering and hallucination mitigation benchmarks for
VLMs and proposes a robust solution for multimodal model control through
activation engineering.

Abstract: Charts play an important role in visualization, reasoning, data analysis, and
the exchange of ideas among humans. However, existing vision-language models
(VLMs) still lack accurate perception of details and struggle to extract
fine-grained structures from charts. Such limitations in chart grounding also
hinder their ability to compare multiple charts and reason over them. In this
paper, we introduce a novel "ChartAlign Benchmark (ChartAB)" to provide a
comprehensive evaluation of VLMs in chart grounding tasks, i.e., extracting
tabular data, localizing visualization elements, and recognizing various
attributes from charts of diverse types and complexities. We design a JSON
template to facilitate the calculation of evaluation metrics specifically
tailored for each grounding task. By incorporating a novel two-stage inference
workflow, the benchmark can further evaluate VLMs' capability to align and
compare elements/attributes across two charts. Our analysis of evaluations on
several recent VLMs reveals new insights into their perception biases,
weaknesses, robustness, and hallucinations in chart understanding. These
findings highlight the fine-grained discrepancies among VLMs in chart
understanding tasks and point to specific skills that need to be strengthened
in current models.

Result: 广泛实验表明，该框架在自动评估和人工评估中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过系统地从视频生成向运动生成迁移知识，有效提升了3D人体运动生成的泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in 3D human motion generation (MoGen) on standard
benchmarks, existing models still face a fundamental bottleneck in their
generalization capability. In contrast, adjacent generative fields, most
notably video generation (ViGen), have demonstrated remarkable generalization
in modeling human behaviors, highlighting transferable insights that MoGen can
leverage. Motivated by this observation, we present a comprehensive framework
that systematically transfers knowledge from ViGen to MoGen across three key
pillars: data, modeling, and evaluation. First, we introduce ViMoGen-228K, a
large-scale dataset comprising 228,000 high-quality motion samples that
integrates high-fidelity optical MoCap data with semantically annotated motions
from web videos and synthesized samples generated by state-of-the-art ViGen
models. The dataset includes both text-motion pairs and text-video-motion
triplets, substantially expanding semantic diversity. Second, we propose
ViMoGen, a flow-matching-based diffusion transformer that unifies priors from
MoCap data and ViGen models through gated multimodal conditioning. To enhance
efficiency, we further develop ViMoGen-light, a distilled variant that
eliminates video generation dependencies while preserving strong
generalization. Finally, we present MBench, a hierarchical benchmark designed
for fine-grained evaluation across motion quality, prompt fidelity, and
generalization ability. Extensive experiments show that our framework
significantly outperforms existing approaches in both automatic and human
evaluations. The code, data, and benchmark will be made publicly available.

Motivation: 解决全球尺度图像地理定位的挑战：标准图像检索方法在大规模数据下效率低且覆盖不足，现有可扩展方案存在粗粒度分类或跨视图检索的领域差距问题

Method: 使用代理分类任务学习丰富特征表示，结合航空影像嵌入增强对稀疏地面数据的鲁棒性，实现直接细粒度检索

Result: 在覆盖欧洲大部分地区的数据集上，68%以上的查询能在200米范围内精确定位

Conclusion: 该方法在大地理范围内实现了细粒度地理定位，解决了现有方法的局限性，代码已公开

Abstract: Determining the precise geographic location of an image at a global scale
remains an unsolved challenge. Standard image retrieval techniques are
inefficient due to the sheer volume of images (>100M) and fail when coverage is
insufficient. Scalable solutions, however, involve a trade-off: global
classification typically yields coarse results (10+ kilometers), while
cross-view retrieval between ground and aerial imagery suffers from a domain
gap and has been primarily studied on smaller regions. This paper introduces a
hybrid approach that achieves fine-grained geo-localization across a large
geographic expanse the size of a continent. We leverage a proxy classification
task during training to learn rich feature representations that implicitly
encode precise location information. We combine these learned prototypes with
embeddings of aerial imagery to increase robustness to the sparsity of
ground-level data. This enables direct, fine-grained retrieval over areas
spanning multiple countries. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that our
approach can localize within 200m more than 68\% of queries of a dataset
covering a large part of Europe. The code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种称为掩码扩散字幕（MDC）的方法，通过图像条件掩码扩散语言模型学习视觉特征，在训练中随机掩码图像字幕对中的文本标记，然后训练基于视觉特征的解码器重建原始文本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自回归字幕方法中视觉学习信号强度依赖于标记在序列中位置的问题，减少对辅助目标的需求，提供更均衡的视觉特征学习。

Method: 使用图像条件掩码扩散语言模型，在训练时随机掩码图像字幕对中的文本标记，训练视觉特征条件解码器重建原始文本。

Result: 在各种学术规模模型和数据集上的线性探测实验表明，学习到的视觉特征与自回归和对比方法产生的特征具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 掩码扩散字幕方法能够有效学习视觉特征，在减少辅助目标依赖的同时，达到与现有方法相当的性能。

Abstract: We learn visual features by captioning images with an image-conditioned
masked diffusion language model, a formulation we call masked diffusion
captioning (MDC). During training, text tokens in each image-caption pair are
masked at a randomly chosen ratio, and a decoder conditioned on visual features
is trained to reconstruct the original text. After training, the learned visual
features can be applied to downstream vision tasks. Unlike autoregressive
captioning, the strength of the visual learning signal in MDC does not depend
on each token's position in the sequence, reducing the need for auxiliary
objectives. Linear probing experiments across a variety of academic-scale
models and datasets show that the learned visual features are competitive with
those produced by autoregressive and contrastive approaches.

TL;DR: 本文对视频生成模型Veo-3在视觉推理能力方面进行了全面评估，发现其在短时空间一致性、细粒度定位和局部动态一致性方面表现良好，但在长时因果推理、严格几何约束和抽象逻辑方面仍有限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估视频模型是否可以作为零样本推理器在具有挑战性的视觉推理场景中使用，特别是研究领先的Veo-3模型在12个维度的推理行为。

Method: 构建了MME-CoF基准数据集，系统评估了Veo-3在空间、几何、物理、时间和具身逻辑等12个维度的推理能力，分析了其优势和失败模式。

Result: 当前视频模型在短时空间一致性、细粒度定位和局部动态一致性方面显示出有希望的推理模式，但在长时因果推理、严格几何约束和抽象逻辑方面存在限制。

Conclusion: 视频模型尚不能作为独立的零样本推理器，但可以作为专用推理模型的补充视觉引擎，显示出令人鼓舞的潜力。

Abstract: Recent video generation models can produce high-fidelity, temporally coherent
videos, indicating that they may encode substantial world knowledge. Beyond
realistic synthesis, they also exhibit emerging behaviors indicative of visual
perception, modeling, and manipulation. Yet, an important question still
remains: Are video models ready to serve as zero-shot reasoners in challenging
visual reasoning scenarios? In this work, we conduct an empirical study to
comprehensively investigate this question, focusing on the leading and popular
Veo-3. We evaluate its reasoning behavior across 12 dimensions, including
spatial, geometric, physical, temporal, and embodied logic, systematically
characterizing both its strengths and failure modes. To standardize this study,
we curate the evaluation data into MME-CoF, a compact benchmark that enables
in-depth and thorough assessment of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning. Our
findings reveal that while current video models demonstrate promising reasoning
patterns on short-horizon spatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, and
locally consistent dynamics, they remain limited in long-horizon causal
reasoning, strict geometric constraints, and abstract logic. Overall, they are
not yet reliable as standalone zero-shot reasoners, but exhibit encouraging
signs as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究引入StreetMath基准来评估大语言模型在现实近似场景下的近似推理能力，发现LLMs在需要近似计算的任务中仍倾向于精确计算或调用外部工具，且近似和精确算术运算依赖不同的神经组件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注大语言模型在精确算术运算上的表现，但在非正式、快速数学运算中的近似推理能力研究不足，特别是在非自回归解码器模型方面。

Method: 引入StreetMath基准，对多种LLM架构进行广泛评估，并应用机制可解释性技术探测其内部计算状态。

Result: LLMs在近似任务中仍尝试计算精确值或调用外部工具；虽然有时在早期层或步骤就能得到正确答案，但解决近似任务时仍消耗更多token；精确和近似算术运算依赖不同的神经组件。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在街头数学场景中不像人类那样表现出认知吝啬性，近似推理能力有待改进。

Abstract: There is a substantial body of literature examining the mathematical
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly their
performance on precise arithmetic operations in autoregressive architectures.
However, their ability to perform approximate reasoning in informal, fast-paced
mathematical operations has received far less attention, especially among
non-autoregressive decoder models. Our work addresses this gap by introducing
StreetMath, a benchmark designed to evaluate models' approximation abilities
under real-world approximation scenarios. We conduct extensive evaluations
across different LLM architectures: Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507,
Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507, Dream-v0-Instruct-7B, Falcon-Mamba-7B-Instruct, and
Mamba-GPT-3B. Furthermore, we apply mechanistic interpretability techniques to
probe their internal computational states. Our analysis reveals that LLMs
generally attempt to compute exact values or invoke external tools even in
tasks that call for approximation. Moreover, while models sometimes reach the
correct answer in early layers or steps, they still consume more tokens when
solving approximation tasks. Additional experiments indicate that exact and
approximate arithmetic operations rely on largely separate neural components.
Drawing upon research on cognitive psychology, we argue that LLMs do not
exhibit cognitive miserliness in the same way humans do in street math
settings. We open source our work https://github.com/ctseng777/StreetMath

Motivation: 传统基于词典的情感分析方法无法考虑意见的强度差异，无法区分非常强烈、强烈、中等、非常弱和弱等不同级别的正负面意见。

Method: 结合模糊逻辑算法将意见词分类到不同强度类别，使用句法依赖解析找到与目标方面相关的意见词，计算实体在特定方面的得分。

Result: 该方法能够对实体评论进行细粒度的情感强度分类，实现基于意见方向和强度的实体排名。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效解决传统情感分析中意见强度区分不足的问题，为实体评价提供更精确的排名依据。

Abstract: Opinion mining, also called sentiment analysis, is the field of study that
analyzes people opinions, sentiments, evaluations, appraisals, attitudes, and
emotions towards entities such as products, services, organizations,
individuals, issues, events, topics, and their attributes. Holistic
lexicon-based approach does not consider the strength of each opinion, i.e.,
whether the opinion is very strongly negative (or positive), strongly negative
(or positive), moderate negative (or positive), very weakly negative (or
positive) and weakly negative (or positive). In this paper, we propose approach
to rank entities based on orientation and strength of the entity reviews and
user's queries by classifying them in granularity levels (i.e. very weak, weak,
moderate, very strong and strong) by combining opinion words (i.e. adverb,
adjective, noun and verb) that are related to aspect of interest of certain
product. We shall use fuzzy logic algorithmic approach in order to classify
opinion words into different category and syntactic dependency resolution to
find relations for desired aspect words. Opinion words related to certain
aspects of interest are considered to find the entity score for that aspect in
the review.

Motivation: 当前立场检测研究主要集中在目标依赖任务且多为英语数据集，难以在韩语等低资源语言中开发模型，特别是在新兴的立场检测领域。

Method: 从韩国政党新闻稿中收集数据，构建包含563,299个标注韩语句子的LASTIST数据集，并训练最先进的深度学习和立场检测模型。

Result: 成功创建了适用于目标无关立场检测和时间演化立场检测等多种任务的韩语立场检测数据集。

Conclusion: LASTIST数据集为韩语立场检测研究提供了重要资源，支持多种立场检测任务的发展。

Abstract: Stance detection has emerged as an area of research in the field of
artificial intelligence. However, most research is currently centered on the
target-dependent stance detection task, which is based on a person's stance in
favor of or against a specific target. Furthermore, most benchmark datasets are
based on English, making it difficult to develop models in low-resource
languages such as Korean, especially for an emerging field such as stance
detection. This study proposes the LArge-Scale Target-Independent STance
(LASTIST) dataset to fill this research gap. Collected from the press releases
of both parties on Korean political parties, the LASTIST dataset uses 563,299
labeled Korean sentences. We provide a detailed description of how we collected
and constructed the dataset and trained state-of-the-art deep learning and
stance detection models. Our LASTIST dataset is designed for various tasks in
stance detection, including target-independent stance detection and diachronic
evolution stance detection. We deploy our dataset on

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种零延迟融合低秩适配器（zFLoRA），在基础模型上引入零或可忽略的延迟开销，解决了传统适配器在推理时计算开销过大的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型部署时使用任务特定适配器，但这些适配器参数虽然只占基础模型的不到1%，却会导致推理时间显著增加（高达基础模型的2.5倍）。

Method: 开发了zFLoRA方法，通过融合低秩适配器实现零延迟，在1B、3B和7B规模的LLMs上进行实验验证。

Result: 在18个不同任务上的实验表明，zFLoRA在常识推理、数学推理和摘要对话三个类别中表现优于流行的监督微调基准，包括LoRA和全微调。在NPU和GPU平台上的延迟测量显示zFLoRA引入零到可忽略的延迟开销。

Conclusion: zFLoRA是一种高效的适配器方法，能够在保持性能的同时消除适配器带来的推理延迟问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed with task-specific
adapters catering to multiple downstream applications. In such a scenario, the
additional compute associated with these apparently insignificant number of
adapter parameters (typically less than 1% of the base model) turns out to be
disproportionately significant during inference time (upto 2.5x times that of
the base model). In this paper, we propose a new zero-latency fused low-rank
adapter (zFLoRA) that introduces zero or negligible latency overhead on top of
the base model. Experimental results on LLMs of size 1B, 3B and 7B show that
zFLoRA compares favorably against the popular supervised fine-tuning benchmarks
including low-rank adapters (LoRA) as well as full fine-tuning (FFT).
Experiments are conducted on 18 different tasks across three different
categories namely commonsense reasoning, math reasoning and summary-dialogue.
Latency measurements made on NPU (Samsung Galaxy S25+) as well as GPU (NVIDIA
H100) platforms show that the proposed zFLoRA adapters introduce zero to
negligible latency overhead.

Abstract: One of the main challenges in mechanistic interpretability is circuit
discovery, determining which parts of a model perform a given task. We build on
the Mechanistic Interpretability Benchmark (MIB) and propose three key
improvements to circuit discovery. First, we use bootstrapping to identify
edges with consistent attribution scores. Second, we introduce a simple
ratio-based selection strategy to prioritize strong positive-scoring edges,
balancing performance and faithfulness. Third, we replace the standard greedy
selection with an integer linear programming formulation. Our methods yield
more faithful circuits and outperform prior approaches across multiple MIB

Abstract: Human experts often struggle to select the best option from a large set of
items with multiple competing objectives, a process bottlenecked by the
difficulty of formalizing complex, implicit preferences. To address this, we
introduce LISTEN, a framework that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) as a
zero-shot preference oracle, guided only by an expert's high-level priorities
in natural language. To operate within LLM constraints like context windows and
inference costs, we propose two iterative algorithms: LISTEN-U, which uses the
LLM to refine a parametric utility function, and LISTEN-T, a non-parametric
method that performs tournament-style selections over small batches of
solutions. Evaluated on diverse tasks including flight booking, shopping, and
exam scheduling, our results show LISTEN-U excels when preferences are
parametrically aligned (a property we measure with a novel concordance metric),
while LISTEN-T offers more robust performance. This work explores a promising
direction for steering complex multi-objective decisions directly with natural
language, reducing the cognitive burden of traditional preference elicitation.

TL;DR: LongFilter是一个用于长上下文预训练的数据筛选框架，通过对比模型在长上下文与短上下文设置下的预测差异，识别具有重要长距离依赖关系的训练样本，从而提升长上下文语言模型的训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的长文本数据大多缺乏有意义的长距离依赖关系，大部分内容仅需局部上下文即可预测，导致训练效率低下。因此需要精心筛选数据来优化长上下文预训练。

Method: LongFilter通过对比模型在长上下文与短上下文设置下的预测差异来度量扩展上下文提供的信息增益，从而识别那些长距离依赖关系至关重要的样本。

Result: 在LLaMA-3-8B模型上将上下文长度从8K扩展到64K的实验表明，LongFilter能高效选择高质量数据，在HELMET、LongBench和RULER等基准测试上取得显著改进。

Conclusion: LongFilter为长上下文预训练提供了一种有效的数据筛选方法，能够识别具有重要长距离依赖关系的训练样本，显著提升模型性能和训练效率。

Abstract: Long-context language models unlock advanced capabilities in reasoning, code
generation, and document summarization by leveraging dependencies across
extended spans of text. However, a significant portion of readily available
long-text data lacks meaningful long-distance dependencies; most spans can be
predicted using only local context. Training on such data is inefficient,
making careful data selection crucial. Therefore, we introduce LongFilter, a
framework for curating training data tailored to long-context pretraining.
LongFilter measures the information gain provided by extended context by
contrasting model predictions under long-context versus short-context settings,
thereby identifying samples where long-range dependencies are essential.
Experiments with LLaMA-3-8B, extending its context length from 8K to 64K, show
that LongFilter efficiently selects high-quality data and yields substantial
improvements on benchmarks such as HELMET, LongBench, and RULER.

Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在内容审核系统中使用人物角色时如何影响公平性和中立性，探索人物角色采用对有害内容分类一致性和公平性的影响。

Method: 通过分析不同LLM架构、模型大小和内容模态下，人物角色对有害内容分类的影响，包括一致性分析、协议分析和针对政治任务的额外研究。

Result: 人物角色导致行为转变，不同意识形态倾向的角色对有害内容标记倾向不同；大模型更倾向于与同意识形态角色保持一致；角色不仅在同意识形态内表现更一致，还会倾向于维护自身观点而淡化对立观点的危害性。

Conclusion: 人物角色调节会在LLM输出中引入微妙的意识形态偏见，对以中立为幌子可能强化党派观点的AI系统使用提出担忧。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in content moderation
systems, where ensuring fairness and neutrality is essential. In this study, we
examine how persona adoption influences the consistency and fairness of harmful
content classification across different LLM architectures, model sizes, and
content modalities (language vs. vision). At first glance, headline performance
metrics suggest that personas have little impact on overall classification
accuracy. However, a closer analysis reveals important behavioral shifts.
Personas with different ideological leanings display distinct propensities to
label content as harmful, showing that the lens through which a model "views"
input can subtly shape its judgments. Further agreement analyses highlight that
models, particularly larger ones, tend to align more closely with personas from
the same political ideology, strengthening within-ideology consistency while
widening divergence across ideological groups. To show this effect more
directly, we conducted an additional study on a politically targeted task,
which confirmed that personas not only behave more coherently within their own
ideology but also exhibit a tendency to defend their perspective while
downplaying harmfulness in opposing views. Together, these findings highlight
how persona conditioning can introduce subtle ideological biases into LLM
outputs, raising concerns about the use of AI systems that may reinforce
partisan perspectives under the guise of neutrality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录中的临床文档以base64编码附件形式存储，使得语义问答变得困难，传统向量数据库方法常常错过细微的临床关系。

Method: 开发了临床笔记QA评估平台，将CLEAR与零样本大上下文推理和传统分块检索增强生成进行对比验证。测试了12个临床笔记，范围从10,000到65,000个token。

Result: CLEAR获得了58.3%的胜率，平均语义相似度0.878，比宽上下文处理减少了78%的token使用量。在超过65,000个token的长文档上表现最佳，胜率达到75%。

Conclusion: 实体感知检索提高了临床自然语言处理的效率和准确性，评估框架为评估临床问答系统提供了可重用且透明的基准。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) store clinical documentation as base64
encoded attachments in FHIR DocumentReference resources, which makes semantic
question answering difficult. Traditional vector database methods often miss
nuanced clinical relationships. The Clinical Entity Augmented Retrieval (CLEAR)
method, introduced by Lopez et al. 2025, uses entity aware retrieval and
achieved improved performance with an F1 score of 0.90 versus 0.86 for
embedding based retrieval, while using over 70 percent fewer tokens. We
developed a Clinical Notes QA Evaluation Platform to validate CLEAR against
zero shot large context inference and traditional chunk based retrieval
augmented generation. The platform was tested on 12 clinical notes ranging from
10,000 to 65,000 tokens representing realistic EHR content. CLEAR achieved a
58.3 percent win rate, an average semantic similarity of 0.878, and used 78
percent fewer tokens than wide context processing. The largest performance
gains occurred on long notes, with a 75 percent win rate for documents
exceeding 65,000 tokens. These findings confirm that entity aware retrieval
improves both efficiency and accuracy in clinical natural language processing.
The evaluation framework provides a reusable and transparent benchmark for
assessing clinical question answering systems where semantic precision and
computational efficiency are critical.

Abstract: Post-training of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for unlocking their
task generalization potential and domain-specific capabilities. However, the
current LLM post-training paradigm faces significant data challenges, including
the high costs of manual annotation and diminishing marginal returns on data
scales. Therefore, achieving data-efficient post-training has become a key
research question. In this paper, we present the first systematic survey of
data-efficient LLM post-training from a data-centric perspective. We propose a
taxonomy of data-efficient LLM post-training methods, covering data selection,
data quality enhancement, synthetic data generation, data distillation and
compression, and self-evolving data ecosystems. We summarize representative
approaches in each category and outline future research directions. By
examining the challenges in data-efficient LLM post-training, we highlight open
problems and propose potential research avenues. We hope our work inspires
further exploration into maximizing the potential of data utilization in
large-scale model training. Paper List:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文评估了使用LLM进行FrameNet语义标注的自动化和半自动化方法，发现半自动标注在框架多样性和标注覆盖率方面表现最佳，而全自动标注除标注时间外其他指标均较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在语言资源创建中有潜力，但对其在标注数据集创建中的性能和影响缺乏全面评估，特别是在视角化NLP方法下。

Method: 比较了三种实验设置下的标注时间、覆盖率和多样性：手动标注、自动标注和半自动标注。

Result: 半自动标注设置相比纯人工设置增加了框架多样性并保持相似的标注覆盖率，而自动设置在除标注时间外的所有指标上都表现较差。

Conclusion: 混合半自动标注方法在语义标注任务中表现最优，结合了人工和自动化的优势。

Abstract: The use of LLM-based applications as a means to accelerate and/or substitute
human labor in the creation of language resources and dataset is a reality.
Nonetheless, despite the potential of such tools for linguistic research,
comprehensive evaluation of their performance and impact on the creation of
annotated datasets, especially under a perspectivized approach to NLP, is still
missing. This paper contributes to reduction of this gap by reporting on an
extensive evaluation of the (semi-)automatization of FrameNet-like semantic
annotation by the use of an LLM-based semantic role labeler. The methodology
employed compares annotation time, coverage and diversity in three experimental
settings: manual, automatic and semi-automatic annotation. Results show that
the hybrid, semi-automatic annotation setting leads to increased frame
diversity and similar annotation coverage, when compared to the human-only
setting, while the automatic setting performs considerably worse in all
metrics, except for annotation time.

TL;DR: RECAP是一个智能代理流程，通过反馈循环从LLM中提取和验证记忆的训练数据，包括越狱模块来克服对齐导致的拒绝，在EchoTrace基准测试中显著提升了提取效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于无法检查大型语言模型的训练数据，需要找到可靠的方法来验证模型是否记忆了特定内容，最有力的证据是模型能够自由重现目标内容。

Method: RECAP采用反馈驱动循环：初始提取尝试由次级语言模型评估，比较输出与参考段落并识别差异，然后转化为最小修正提示反馈给目标模型指导后续生成，还包括检测和克服对齐拒绝的越狱模块。

Result: 在EchoTrace基准测试（覆盖30多本完整书籍）上，RECAP相比单次迭代方法有显著提升。使用GPT-4.1时，受版权文本提取的平均ROUGE-L分数从0.38提高到0.47，增加了近24%。

Conclusion: RECAP能够有效提取和验证LLM记忆的训练数据，通过反馈循环和越狱机制显著提升了提取效果，为解决训练数据检查问题提供了可行方案。

Abstract: If we cannot inspect the training data of a large language model (LLM), how
can we ever know what it has seen? We believe the most compelling evidence
arises when the model itself freely reproduces the target content. As such, we
propose RECAP, an agentic pipeline designed to elicit and verify memorized
training data from LLM outputs. At the heart of RECAP is a feedback-driven
loop, where an initial extraction attempt is evaluated by a secondary language
model, which compares the output against a reference passage and identifies
discrepancies. These are then translated into minimal correction hints, which
are fed back into the target model to guide subsequent generations. In
addition, to address alignment-induced refusals, RECAP includes a jailbreaking
module that detects and overcomes such barriers. We evaluate RECAP on
EchoTrace, a new benchmark spanning over 30 full books, and the results show
that RECAP leads to substantial gains over single-iteration approaches. For
instance, with GPT-4.1, the average ROUGE-L score for the copyrighted text
extraction improved from 0.38 to 0.47 - a nearly 24% increase.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究挑战了多语言预训练中的常见假设，发现当语言在预训练语料中有足够token时，混合英语和多语言数据不会降低性能，英语作为枢纽语言有益于所有语系，且未观察到明显的"多语言诅咒"。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多语言数据混合对大型语言模型预训练的影响，特别是关于语言覆盖范围与模型性能之间潜在权衡的争议。

Method: 训练1.1B和3B参数的LLM，在多样化的多语言语料库上进行实验，语言数量从25到400不等，研究英语作为枢纽语言的作用。

Result: 发现当语言有足够预训练token时，英语和多语言数据组合不会降低性能；英语作为枢纽语言对所有语系都有益；增加训练语言数量未观察到明显的多语言诅咒。

Conclusion: 适当平衡的多语言数据可以增强语言模型能力而不损害性能，即使在低资源设置下也是如此。

Abstract: The impact of different multilingual data mixtures in pretraining large
language models (LLMs) has been a topic of ongoing debate, often raising
concerns about potential trade-offs between language coverage and model
performance (i.e., the curse of multilinguality). In this work, we investigate
these assumptions by training 1.1B and 3B parameter LLMs on diverse
multilingual corpora, varying the number of languages from 25 to 400. Our study
challenges common beliefs surrounding multilingual training. First, we find
that combining English and multilingual data does not necessarily degrade the
in-language performance of either group, provided that languages have a
sufficient number of tokens included in the pretraining corpus. Second, we
observe that using English as a pivot language (i.e., a high-resource language
that serves as a catalyst for multilingual generalization) yields benefits
across language families, and contrary to expectations, selecting a pivot
language from within a specific family does not consistently improve
performance for languages within that family. Lastly, we do not observe a
significant "curse of multilinguality" as the number of training languages
increases in models at this scale. Our findings suggest that multilingual data,
when balanced appropriately, can enhance language model capabilities without
compromising performance, even in low-resource settings

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 机器翻译中的文化差异会导致语义标签漂移，特别是在文化敏感领域，LLMs会编码文化知识并放大这种漂移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究机器翻译中文化对齐对语义标签保存的影响，因为文化差异可能导致翻译过程中的标签漂移或改变。

Method: 通过跨文化敏感和中性领域的实验，分析不同MT系统（包括传统统计MT和现代LLMs）在翻译过程中的标签漂移现象。

Result: 发现：(1) MT系统（包括LLMs）在翻译中诱导标签漂移，尤其在文化敏感领域；(2) LLMs编码文化知识并会放大标签漂移；(3) 源语言和目标语言的文化相似性是标签保存的关键因素。

Conclusion: 忽视MT中的文化因素不仅会损害标签保真度，还会导致下游应用中的误解和文化冲突风险。

Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) is widely employed to address resource scarcity in
low-resource languages by generating synthetic data from high-resource
counterparts. While sentiment preservation in translation has long been
studied, a critical but underexplored factor is the role of cultural alignment
between source and target languages. In this paper, we hypothesize that
semantic labels are drifted or altered during MT due to cultural divergence.
Through a series of experiments across culturally sensitive and neutral
domains, we establish three key findings: (1) MT systems, including modern
Large Language Models (LLMs), induce label drift during translation,
particularly in culturally sensitive domains; (2) unlike earlier statistical MT
tools, LLMs encode cultural knowledge, and leveraging this knowledge can
amplify label drift; and (3) cultural similarity or dissimilarity between
source and target languages is a crucial determinant of label preservation. Our
findings highlight that neglecting cultural factors in MT not only undermines
label fidelity but also risks misinterpretation and cultural conflict in
downstream applications.

TL;DR: SymCode是一个神经符号框架，将数学问题解决重新定义为使用SymPy库的可验证代码生成任务，显著提高了LLM在复杂数学推理中的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂数学推理中表现不佳，基于文本的生成方法会产生未经验证且算术上不可靠的解决方案，缺乏确定性验证机制。

Method: 引入SymCode框架，将数学问题解决重新定义为使用SymPy库的可验证代码生成任务，通过符号计算引擎来验证LLM的推理过程。

Result: 在MATH-500和OlympiadBench等挑战性基准测试中，SymCode相比基线方法实现了高达13.6个百分点的准确性提升，且更节省token。

Conclusion: SymCode通过将LLM推理建立在确定性符号引擎上，从根本上将模型失败从模糊的逻辑谬误转向透明的程序化错误，是朝着更准确和可信AI的关键一步。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex mathematical
reasoning, where prose-based generation leads to unverified and arithmetically
unsound solutions. Current prompting strategies like Chain of Thought still
operate within this unreliable medium, lacking a mechanism for deterministic
verification. To address these limitations, we introduce SymCode, a
neurosymbolic framework that reframes mathematical problem-solving as a task of
verifiable code generation using the SymPy library. We evaluate SymCode on
challenging benchmarks, including MATH-500 and OlympiadBench, demonstrating
significant accuracy improvements of up to 13.6 percentage points over
baselines. Our analysis shows that SymCode is not only more token-efficient but
also fundamentally shifts model failures from opaque logical fallacies towards
transparent, programmatic errors. By grounding LLM reasoning in a deterministic
symbolic engine, SymCode represents a key step towards more accurate and
trustworthy AI in formal domains.

TL;DR: 本文针对AWS Trainium AI加速器，设计了高性能的矩阵乘法内核，通过内核融合和缓存策略优化，在LLM推理中实现了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trainium加速器虽然为AI工作负载提供了成本效益和高性能解决方案，但其脉动阵列架构和数据布局的特殊要求使得实现高性能具有挑战性。

Method: 采用基于内核融合和新型缓存策略的一系列技术，减少软件管理内存层次结构中的数据移动，最大化SRAM带宽，避免昂贵的矩阵转置操作。

Result: 在9个数据集和4个最新LLM上的评估显示，相比AWS现有实现，矩阵乘法内核平均加速1.35倍（最高2.22倍），端到端LLM推理平均加速1.66倍（最高2.49倍）。

Conclusion: 针对Trainium架构定制的矩阵乘法优化技术能够显著提升LLM推理性能，证明了所提出方法的有效性。

Abstract: AI accelerators, customized to AI workloads, provide cost-effective and
high-performance solutions for training and inference. Trainium, an AI
accelerator recently developed by Amazon Web Services (AWS), provides an
attractive option for LLM training and inference through its heterogeneous
architecture. However, leveraging Trainium architecture for high performance
can be challenging because of its systolic array architecture and special
requirement on data layout. In this paper, we design high-performance matrix
multiplication (matmul), a critical compute kernel, for LLM inference on
Trainium. We introduce a series of techniques customized to Trainium based on
kernel fusion and novel caching strategies to reduce data movement across the
software-managed memory hierarchy, maximize SRAM bandwidth, and avoid expensive
matrix transpose. Evaluating with nine datasets and four recent LLMs, we show
that our system largely outperforms the state-of-the-art matmul implemented by
AWS on Trainium: at the level of matmul kernel, it achieves an average 1.35x
speedup (up to 2.22x), which translates to an average 1.66x speedup (up to
2.49x) for end-to-end LLM inference.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AttnCache通过检索和重用相似的注意力图来加速LLM推理的prefill阶段，在CPU和GPU上分别实现1.2-1.6倍端到端加速和2-3倍注意力计算加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多实际工作负载（如分类、问答、推荐等）仅依赖LLM推理的prefill阶段，其中自注意力计算因二次复杂度成为性能瓶颈。

Method: 基于观察到语义不同句子在不同层和头上产生相似注意力图，提出AttnCache框架，通过注意力图记忆数据库进行高效缓存和相似性搜索，重用预缓存注意力图。

Result: 实验显示在CPU上平均实现1.2倍端到端和2倍注意力加速，GPU上1.6倍端到端和3倍注意力加速，精度损失可忽略。

Conclusion: AttnCache能有效加速LLM prefill阶段推理，显著降低自注意力计算开销。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in generative applications such
as chatting, code generation, and reasoning. However, many realworld workloads
such as classification, question answering, recommendation, and text embedding
rely solely on the prefill stage of inference, where the model encodes input
sequences without performing autoregressive decoding. In these prefill only
scenarios, the self-attention computation becomes the primary performance
bottleneck due to its quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length. In
this paper, we observe that semantically different sentences often produce
similar attention maps across layers and heads. Building on this insight, we
propose AttnCache, a framework that accelerates the prefill stage of LLM
inference by retrieving and reusing similar attention maps. Based on an
attention map memorization database, AttnCache employs efficient caching and
similarity search techniques to identify and reuse pre-cached attention maps
during inference, thereby reducing the computational overhead of
self-attention. Experimental results show that AttnCache achieves an average of
1.2x end-to-end and 2x attention speedup on CPU, and 1.6x end-to-end and 3x
attention speedup on GPU, with negligible accuracy degradation.

TL;DR: 提出监督强化学习（SRL）框架，将问题解决重新表述为生成逻辑"动作"序列，通过内部推理独白和基于专家动作相似性的逐步奖励，解决了小规模开源模型在多步推理任务中的训练难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多步推理任务上表现不佳，小规模开源模型面临两个问题：RLVR在正确解很少被采样时失败，SFT倾向于通过严格的逐词模仿过度拟合长演示。

Method: SRL框架将问题解决重新表述为生成逻辑动作序列，训练模型在提交每个动作前生成内部推理独白，基于模型动作与SFT数据集中专家动作的相似性提供逐步奖励。

Result: SRL使小模型能够学习SFT或RLVR无法学习的挑战性问题，先用SRL初始化训练再用RLVR精炼可获得最强整体性能，且SRL能有效泛化到代理软件工程任务。

Conclusion: SRL是一个稳健且多功能的面向推理的LLM训练框架，通过结合监督学习和强化学习的优势，解决了小模型在多步推理任务中的训练挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with problems that require
multi-step reasoning. For small-scale open-source models, Reinforcement
Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) fails when correct solutions are rarely
sampled even after many attempts, while Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tends to
overfit long demonstrations through rigid token-by-token imitation. To address
this gap, we propose Supervised Reinforcement Learning (SRL), a framework that
reformulates problem solving as generating a sequence of logical "actions". SRL
trains the model to generate an internal reasoning monologue before committing
to each action. It provides smoother rewards based on the similarity between
the model's actions and expert actions extracted from the SFT dataset in a
step-wise manner. This supervision offers richer learning signals even when all
rollouts are incorrect, while encouraging flexible reasoning guided by expert
demonstrations. As a result, SRL enables small models to learn challenging
problems previously unlearnable by SFT or RLVR. Moreover, initializing training
with SRL before refining with RLVR yields the strongest overall performance.
Beyond reasoning benchmarks, SRL generalizes effectively to agentic software
engineering tasks, establishing it as a robust and versatile training framework
for reasoning-oriented LLMs.

TL;DR: PORTool是一种基于强化学习的工具使用LLM训练方法，通过探索多种正确轨迹来提升模型在动态工具调用环境中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于静态数据集训练的工具使用LLM只能模仿通用工具调用流程，无法探索可能的解决方案，在动态工具调用环境中表现有限。

Method: 使用强化学习方法：1)为给定查询生成多个轨迹，形成树状结构；2)基于产生正确答案和成功工具调用的能力分配步骤奖励；3)计算分叉相对优势和轨迹相对优势来训练LLM。

Result: 在17种工具的实验环境中，PORTool在最终准确率和工具调用步骤数量方面相比其他训练方法有显著提升。

Conclusion: PORTool通过强化学习探索多种正确轨迹，有效提升了工具使用LLM在动态环境中的性能。

Abstract: Current tool-use large language models (LLMs) are trained on static datasets,
enabling them to interact with external tools and perform multi-step,
tool-integrated reasoning, which produces tool-call trajectories. However,
these models imitate how a query is resolved in a generic tool-call routine,
thereby failing to explore possible solutions and demonstrating limited
performance in an evolved, dynamic tool-call environment. In this work, we
propose PORTool, a reinforcement learning (RL) method that encourages a
tool-use LLM to explore various trajectories yielding the correct answer.
Specifically, this method starts with generating multiple rollouts for a given
query, and some of them share the first few tool-call steps, thereby forming a
tree-like structure. Next, we assign rewards to each step, based on its ability
to produce a correct answer and make successful tool calls. A shared step
across different trajectories receives the same reward, while different steps
under the same fork receive different rewards. Finally, these step-wise rewards
are used to calculate fork-relative advantages, blended with
trajectory-relative advantages, to train the LLM for tool use. The experiments
utilize 17 tools to address user queries, covering both time-sensitive and
time-invariant topics. We conduct ablation studies to systematically justify
the necessity and the design robustness of step-wise rewards. Furthermore, we
compare the proposed PORTool with other training approaches and demonstrate
significant improvements in final accuracy and the number of tool-call steps.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个评估跨语言对齐（CLA）中知识转移与文化擦除权衡的框架，发现现有方法在提升事实转移的同时会损害文化本地化，并基于模型层级的可调控性提出了Surgical Steering方法来实现更好的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究跨语言对齐可能导致的文化擦除问题，即追求多语言表示对齐时可能丧失提供文化特定响应的能力。

Method: 引入转移-本地化平面评估框架，重新评估现有CLA方法，并基于模型内部表示分析提出Surgical Steering推理时方法，通过在不同层级应用定向激活调控来分离事实转移和文化特定知识。

Result: 发现现有CLA方法在六种语言中都一致地以牺牲文化本地化为代价来改善事实转移，且事实转移和文化特定知识在不同模型层级具有最优可调控性。

Conclusion: 通过Surgical Steering方法可以有效平衡跨语言对齐中的事实转移和文化本地化两个竞争目标，克服现有对齐技术的局限性。

Abstract: Cross-lingual alignment (CLA) aims to align multilingual representations,
enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to seamlessly transfer knowledge across
languages. While intuitive, we hypothesize, this pursuit of representational
convergence can inadvertently cause "cultural erasure", the functional loss of
providing culturally-situated responses that should diverge based on the query
language. In this work, we systematically analyze this trade-off by introducing
a holistic evaluation framework, the transfer-localization plane, which
quantifies both desirable knowledge transfer and undesirable cultural erasure.
Using this framework, we re-evaluate recent CLA approaches and find that they
consistently improve factual transfer at the direct cost of cultural
localization across all six languages studied. Our investigation into the
internal representations of these models reveals a key insight: universal
factual transfer and culturally-specific knowledge are optimally steerable at
different model layers. Based on this finding, we propose Surgical Steering, a
novel inference-time method that disentangles these two objectives. By applying
targeted activation steering to distinct layers, our approach achieves a better
balance between the two competing dimensions, effectively overcoming the
limitations of current alignment techniques.

TL;DR: 开发并验证了一个基于自然语言处理的管道来识别放射学报告中的偶发甲状腺发现，评估其患病率、特征和临床结果。研究发现ITFs很常见，且与导致检测小、低风险癌症的级联效应密切相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着非甲状腺指征的影像学检查增多，偶发甲状腺发现的患病率、特征和临床后果仍不明确，需要系统评估。

Method: 回顾性队列研究，使用基于transformer的自然语言处理管道从多模态和身体区域的影像报告中识别ITFs并提取结节特征。

Result: 在115,683名患者中，7.8%有ITF，其中92.9%为结节。ITFs患者甲状腺结节诊断、活检、甲状腺切除术和甲状腺癌诊断的几率更高。大多数癌症为乳头状癌，且ITFs检测到的癌症更大。

Conclusion: ITFs很常见，且与导致甲状腺癌过度诊断的级联效应密切相关，需要标准化报告和更有选择性的随访。

Abstract: Importance Incidental thyroid findings (ITFs) are increasingly detected on
imaging performed for non-thyroid indications. Their prevalence, features, and
clinical consequences remain undefined. Objective To develop, validate, and
deploy a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline to identify ITFs in
radiology reports and assess their prevalence, features, and clinical outcomes.
Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective cohort of adults without prior
thyroid disease undergoing thyroid-capturing imaging at Mayo Clinic sites from
July 1, 2017, to September 30, 2023. A transformer-based NLP pipeline
identified ITFs and extracted nodule characteristics from image reports from
multiple modalities and body regions. Main Outcomes and Measures Prevalence of
ITFs, downstream thyroid ultrasound, biopsy, thyroidectomy, and thyroid cancer
diagnosis. Logistic regression identified demographic and imaging-related
factors. Results Among 115,683 patients (mean age, 56.8 [SD 17.2] years; 52.9%
women), 9,077 (7.8%) had an ITF, of which 92.9% were nodules. ITFs were more
likely in women, older adults, those with higher BMI, and when imaging was
ordered by oncology or internal medicine. Compared with chest CT, ITFs were
more likely via neck CT, PET, and nuclear medicine scans. Nodule
characteristics were poorly documented, with size reported in 44% and other
features in fewer than 15% (e.g. calcifications). Compared with patients
without ITFs, those with ITFs had higher odds of thyroid nodule diagnosis,
biopsy, thyroidectomy and thyroid cancer diagnosis. Most cancers were
papillary, and larger when detected after ITFs vs no ITF. Conclusions ITFs were
common and strongly associated with cascades leading to the detection of small,
low-risk cancers. These findings underscore the role of ITFs in thyroid cancer
overdiagnosis and the need for standardized reporting and more selective
follow-up.

Motivation: 当前LLM在需要与硬件设备交互的领域（如量子编程）中的代码生成能力尚未充分探索，需要专门的评估框架来填补这一空白。

Method: 开发QCoder Benchmark，支持量子模拟器环境评估，提供电路深度、执行时间、错误分类等反馈，并整合真实编程竞赛的人类代码提交。

Result: 实验显示GPT-4o仅达到18.97%准确率，而基于推理的模型如o3可达78%准确率，超过了人类代码的平均成功率（39.98%）。

Conclusion: 量子编程对LLM具有挑战性，推理模型表现更佳，QCoder Benchmark为相关研究提供了有价值的评估工具和数据集。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have increasingly been applied to automatic
programming code generation. This task can be viewed as a language generation
task that bridges natural language, human knowledge, and programming logic.
However, it remains underexplored in domains that require interaction with
hardware devices, such as quantum programming, where human coders write Python
code that is executed on a quantum computer. To address this gap, we introduce
QCoder Benchmark, an evaluation framework that assesses LLMs on quantum
programming with feedback from simulated hardware devices. Our benchmark offers
two key features. First, it supports evaluation using a quantum simulator
environment beyond conventional Python execution, allowing feedback of
domain-specific metrics such as circuit depth, execution time, and error
classification, which can be used to guide better generation. Second, it
incorporates human-written code submissions collected from real programming
contests, enabling both quantitative comparisons and qualitative analyses of
LLM outputs against human-written codes. Our experiments reveal that even
advanced models like GPT-4o achieve only around 18.97% accuracy, highlighting
the difficulty of the benchmark. In contrast, reasoning-based models such as o3
reach up to 78% accuracy, outperforming averaged success rates of human-written
codes (39.98%). We release the QCoder Benchmark dataset and public evaluation
API to support further research.

Result: 实验显示RPD选择的训练集能产生更多样化的输出和更高的pass@k，在pass@16上平均提升2.80%，在AIME24上提升4.99%。

Conclusion: 1PNS训练范式能有效增强测试时扩展的效果，通过提升推理路径多样性来改善模型性能。

Abstract: While Test-Time Scaling (TTS) has proven effective in improving the reasoning
ability of large language models (LLMs), low diversity in model outputs often
becomes a bottleneck; this is partly caused by the common "one problem, one
solution" (1P1S) training practice, which provides a single canonical answer
and can push models toward a narrow set of reasoning paths. To address this, we
propose a "one problem, multiple solutions" (1PNS) training paradigm that
exposes the model to a variety of valid reasoning trajectories and thus
increases inference diversity. A core challenge for 1PNS is reliably measuring
semantic differences between multi-step chains of thought, so we introduce
Reasoning Path Divergence (RPD), a step-level metric that aligns and scores
Long Chain-of-Thought solutions to capture differences in intermediate
reasoning. Using RPD, we curate maximally diverse solution sets per problem and
fine-tune Qwen3-4B-Base. Experiments show that RPD-selected training yields
more varied outputs and higher pass@k, with an average +2.80% gain in pass@16
over a strong 1P1S baseline and a +4.99% gain on AIME24, demonstrating that
1PNS further amplifies the effectiveness of TTS. Our code is available at

### [94] [On the Influence of Discourse Relations in Persuasive Texts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26124)
*Nawar Turk,Sevag Kaspar,Leila Kosseim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文利用大语言模型和提示工程研究说服技巧与语篇关系之间的关联，通过创建包含两种标注的银数据集，发现六种语篇关系在说服性文本中起关键作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于没有同时标注说服技巧和语篇关系的数据集，需要探索这两种语言现象之间的关系，以帮助检测网络宣传和虚假信息。

Method: 使用SemEval 2023 Task 3数据集，开发基于LLM的分类器标注22种PDTB 3.0语篇关系，评估4个LLM和10种提示，创建5个银数据集。

Result: 统计分析显示六种语篇关系（原因、目的、对比、原因+信念、让步、条件）在说服性文本中至关重要，特别是在使用负载语言、夸张/最小化、重复和表达怀疑时。

Conclusion: 该研究为检测网络宣传和虚假信息提供了见解，并增进了对有效沟通的一般理解。

Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between Persuasion Techniques (PTs)
and Discourse Relations (DRs) by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and
prompt engineering. Since no dataset annotated with both PTs and DRs exists, we
took the SemEval 2023 Task 3 dataset labelled with 19 PTs as a starting point
and developed LLM-based classifiers to label each instance of the dataset with
one of the 22 PDTB 3.0 level-2 DRs. In total, four LLMs were evaluated using 10
different prompts, resulting in 40 unique DR classifiers. Ensemble models using
different majority-pooling strategies were used to create 5 silver datasets of
instances labelled with both persuasion techniques and level-2 PDTB senses. The
silver dataset sizes vary from 1,281 instances to 204 instances, depending on
the majority pooling technique used. Statistical analysis of these silver
datasets shows that six discourse relations (namely Cause, Purpose, Contrast,
Cause+Belief, Concession, and Condition) play a crucial role in persuasive
texts, especially in the use of Loaded Language, Exaggeration/Minimisation,
Repetition and to cast Doubt. This insight can contribute to detecting online
propaganda and misinformation, as well as to our general understanding of
effective communication.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出MossNet，一种混合状态空间专家架构，通过MoE实现多注意力头模拟，在语言建模和下游任务中优于类似规模的Transformer和SSM模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于SSM/GRM的方法通常只模拟单个注意力头，可能限制了表达能力，需要更有效的多注意力头模拟方法。

Method: 使用混合专家(MoE)方法，不仅在通道混合MLP块中，还在时间混合SSM核中实现多个"注意力头"，模拟线性多头注意力机制。

Result: 在语言建模和下游评估中，MossNet在相似模型大小和数据预算下优于Transformer和SSM架构，大模型变体在万亿token训练中进一步证实其可扩展性和优越性能。

Conclusion: MossNet是高效、高性能循环LLM架构的一个有前景的新方向，在真实设备上表现出良好的运行速度和资源使用效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced generative
applications in natural language processing (NLP). Recent trends in model
architectures revolve around efficient variants of transformers or
state-space/gated-recurrent models (SSMs, GRMs). However, prevailing
SSM/GRM-based methods often emulate only a single attention head, potentially
limiting their expressiveness. In this work, we propose MossNet, a novel
mixture-of-state-space-experts architecture that emulates a linear multi-head
attention (MHA). MossNet leverages a mixture-of-experts (MoE) implementation
not only in channel-mixing multi-layered perceptron (MLP) blocks but also in
the time-mixing SSM kernels to realize multiple "attention heads." Extensive
experiments on language modeling and downstream evaluations show that MossNet
outperforms both transformer- and SSM-based architectures of similar model size
and data budgets. Larger variants of MossNet, trained on trillions of tokens,
further confirm its scalability and superior performance. In addition,
real-device profiling on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra and an Nvidia A100 GPU
demonstrate favorable runtime speed and resource usage compared to similarly
sized baselines. Our results suggest that MossNet is a compelling new direction
for efficient, high-performing recurrent LLM architectures.

*Allen Schmaltz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了相似度-距离-幅度（SDM）语言模型，通过监督微调将预训练的解码器Transformer模型转换为SDM模型，使用SDM激活层进行二元分类，减少弃权率并提高统计效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型在指令遵循任务中存在弃权率较高的问题，需要提高模型的统计效率和校准性能。

Method: 使用监督微调方法，在训练过程中引入SDM激活层进行二元分类，采用对比输入编码方案和在线生成的硬负例来优化下一个token的损失函数。

Result: 与强监督基线相比，SDM模型显著减少了弃权率，提高了统计效率。

Conclusion: SDM语言模型能够有效提升预训练语言模型在指令遵循任务中的性能，通过简单的微调即可实现更好的校准和效率。

Abstract: We introduce Similarity-Distance-Magnitude (SDM) language models (LMs), which
are sequence prediction models fine-tuned to maximize the proportion of
generations in the well-calibrated, high-probability region partitioned by a
final-layer SDM activation layer used for binary classification of
instruction-following. We demonstrate that existing pre-trained decoder-only
Transformer LMs can be readily converted into SDM LMs via supervised
fine-tuning, using the final-layer SDM activation layer during training to
estimate a change-of-base for a supervised next-token loss over a contrastive
input encoding scheme, with additional hard negative examples generated online
during training. This results in reduced abstentions (i.e., improved
statistical efficiency) compared to strong supervised baselines.

*Dongjun Jang,Youngchae Ahn,Hyopil Shin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RCScore是一个多维度框架，用于量化指令表述对LLM响应的影响，通过系统地将基准问题转换为多种指令风格来揭示传统指标未检测到的性能变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM评估通常依赖单一指令模板，忽视了模型对指令风格的敏感性，这对实际部署至关重要。

Method: 通过系统地将基准问题转换为多种指令风格，并引入跨响应相似性(CRS)方法来测量风格自一致性。

Result: 在四个推理基准上的十个LLM实验表明，指令风格可使准确率变化高达16.7个百分点，且CRS与任务准确性呈强相关。

Conclusion: RCScore提供了一个原则性方法来评估指令鲁棒性，确定性解码产生更稳定的输出，模型规模与跨风格一致性正相关。

Abstract: Current LLM evaluations often rely on a single instruction template,
overlooking models' sensitivity to instruction style-a critical aspect for
real-world deployments. We present RCScore, a multi-dimensional framework
quantifying how instruction formulation affects model responses. By
systematically transforming benchmark problems into multiple instruction
styles, RCScore reveals performance variations undetected by conventional
metrics. Our experiments across ten LLMs on four reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that instruction style can shift accuracy by up to 16.7% points. We
introduce Cross-Response Similarity (CRS), a method applying RCScore metrics to
measure stylistic self-consistency, and establish its strong correlation with
task accuracy, suggesting consistency as a valuable proxy for model
reliability. Additional findings show that deterministic decoding produces more
stylistically stable outputs, and model scale correlates positively with
cross-style consistency. RCScore offers a principled approach to assess
instruction robustness.

### [98] [Don't Let It Fade: Preserving Edits in Diffusion Language Models via Token Timestep Allocation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26200)
*Woojin Kim,Jaeyoung Do*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了Token Timestep Allocation (TTA)方法，通过为每个token分配不同的时间步调度来解决扩散语言模型中的更新遗忘问题，显著提升了控制性和流畅性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型在实际控制性方面存在脆弱性，主要问题是更新遗忘——均匀且上下文无关的更新会导致token级别的时间步波动，抹去早期的语义编辑并破坏累积精炼过程。

Method: 提出Token Timestep Allocation (TTA)，通过每个token的时间步调度实现软语义token排序：关键token早期冻结，不确定token持续精炼。可以是固定策略或由任务信号驱动的自适应策略。

Result: 在情感控制任务中，TTA将准确率提高20%以上，困惑度降低近一半，且使用不到五分之一的时间步；在去毒任务中，最大毒性从14.5降至12.2，困惑度从32.0降至26.0。

Conclusion: 通过时间步分配的软化排序是缓解更新遗忘、实现稳定可控扩散文本生成的关键机制。

Abstract: While diffusion language models (DLMs) enable fine-grained refinement, their
practical controllability remains fragile. We identify and formally
characterize a central failure mode called update forgetting, in which uniform
and context agnostic updates induce token level fluctuations across timesteps,
erasing earlier semantic edits and disrupting the cumulative refinement
process, thereby degrading fluency and coherence. As this failure originates in
uniform and context agnostic updates, effective control demands explicit token
ordering. We propose Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), which realizes soft and
semantic token ordering via per token timestep schedules: critical tokens are
frozen early, while uncertain tokens receive continued refinement. This
timestep based ordering can be instantiated as either a fixed policy or an
adaptive policy driven by task signals, thereby supporting a broad spectrum of
refinement strategies. Because it operates purely at inference time, it applies
uniformly across various DLMs and naturally extends to diverse supervision
sources. Empirically, TTA improves controllability and fluency: on sentiment
control, it yields more than 20 percent higher accuracy and nearly halves
perplexity using less than one fifth the steps; in detoxification, it lowers
maximum toxicity (12.2 versus 14.5) and perplexity (26.0 versus 32.0).
Together, these results demonstrate that softened ordering via timestep
allocation is the critical lever for mitigating update forgetting and achieving
stable and controllable diffusion text generation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: WIMHF方法使用稀疏自编码器解释人类反馈数据，识别可解释的特征来理解反馈数据编码的偏好，实现数据筛选和个性化微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类反馈可能以不可预测的方式改变语言模型，但实践者缺乏对反馈数据编码内容的理解。现有方法需要预先指定假设特征，难以自动提取相关特征。

Method: 引入WIMHF方法，使用稀疏自编码器解释反馈数据，既能表征数据集能够测量的偏好，也能表征标注者实际表达的偏好。

Result: 在7个数据集上，WIMHF识别出少量人类可解释的特征，这些特征占黑盒模型偏好预测信号的主要部分。发现不同数据集用户偏好差异很大，还发现了潜在的不安全偏好。学习到的特征能有效筛选数据（安全性能提升37%）和实现个性化微调。

Conclusion: WIMHF为实践者提供了一种以人为中心的分析方法，帮助更好地理解和利用偏好数据。

Abstract: Human feedback can alter language models in unpredictable and undesirable
ways, as practitioners lack a clear understanding of what feedback data
encodes. While prior work studies preferences over certain attributes (e.g.,
length or sycophancy), automatically extracting relevant features without
pre-specifying hypotheses remains challenging. We introduce What's In My Human
Feedback? (WIMHF), a method to explain feedback data using sparse autoencoders.
WIMHF characterizes both (1) the preferences a dataset is capable of measuring
and (2) the preferences that the annotators actually express. Across 7
datasets, WIMHF identifies a small number of human-interpretable features that
account for the majority of the preference prediction signal achieved by
black-box models. These features reveal a wide diversity in what humans prefer,
and the role of dataset-level context: for example, users on Reddit prefer
informality and jokes, while annotators in HH-RLHF and PRISM disprefer them.
WIMHF also surfaces potentially unsafe preferences, such as that LMArena users
tend to vote against refusals, often in favor of toxic content. The learned
features enable effective data curation: re-labeling the harmful examples in
Arena yields large safety gains (+37%) with no cost to general performance.
They also allow fine-grained personalization: on the Community Alignment
dataset, we learn annotator-specific weights over subjective features that
improve preference prediction. WIMHF provides a human-centered analysis method
for practitioners to better understand and use preference data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了首个专门评估全局RAG能力的基准GlobalQA，并开发了GlobalRAG框架来显著提升全局信息聚合任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG评估基准主要关注局部RAG能力，但现实应用中需要全局RAG能力来聚合分析整个文档集合的信息。

Method: 提出了GlobalRAG框架，包含：分块级检索保持结构连贯性、LLM驱动的智能过滤器去除噪声文档、集成聚合模块进行精确符号计算。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-14B模型上，GlobalRAG达到6.63 F1，而最强基线仅为1.51 F1，性能提升显著。

Conclusion: GlobalRAG框架有效解决了全局RAG任务中的挑战，为文档级信息聚合提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a leading approach to
reducing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). Current RAG evaluation
benchmarks primarily focus on what we call local RAG: retrieving relevant
chunks from a small subset of documents to answer queries that require only
localized understanding within specific text chunks. However, many real-world
applications require a fundamentally different capability -- global RAG --
which involves aggregating and analyzing information across entire document
collections to derive corpus-level insights (for example, "What are the top 10
most cited papers in 2023?"). In this paper, we introduce GlobalQA -- the first
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate global RAG capabilities, covering
four core task types: counting, extremum queries, sorting, and top-k
extraction. Through systematic evaluation across different models and
baselines, we find that existing RAG methods perform poorly on global tasks,
with the strongest baseline achieving only 1.51 F1 score. To address these
challenges, we propose GlobalRAG, a multi-tool collaborative framework that
preserves structural coherence through chunk-level retrieval, incorporates
LLM-driven intelligent filters to eliminate noisy documents, and integrates
aggregation modules for precise symbolic computation. On the Qwen2.5-14B model,
GlobalRAG achieves 6.63 F1 compared to the strongest baseline's 1.51 F1,
validating the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: 通过将语用学理论作为提示提供给语言模型，可以显著提升其在理解隐含含义任务上的表现，最高可提升9.6%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确理解隐含含义在人类沟通中至关重要，语言模型也应具备这种能力。研究探索如何通过语用学理论提示来增强语言模型的语用推理能力。

Method: 提出一种方法，将Gricean语用学和关联理论等语用学理论概述作为提示提供给语言模型，引导其通过逐步推理过程得出最终解释。

Result: 相比仅提示中间推理而不提供语用学理论的基线方法（0-shot Chain-of-Thought），该方法使语言模型在语用推理任务上获得了高达9.6%的性能提升。在更大模型中，即使仅提及语用学理论名称也能带来1-3%的性能改善。

Conclusion: 将语用学理论作为提示是一种有效的上下文学习方法，能够显著提升语言模型理解隐含含义的能力。

Abstract: The ability to accurately interpret implied meanings plays a crucial role in
human communication and language use, and language models are also expected to
possess this capability. This study demonstrates that providing language models
with pragmatic theories as prompts is an effective in-context learning approach
for tasks to understand implied meanings. Specifically, we propose an approach
in which an overview of pragmatic theories, such as Gricean pragmatics and
Relevance Theory, is presented as a prompt to the language model, guiding it
through a step-by-step reasoning process to derive a final interpretation.
Experimental results showed that, compared to the baseline, which prompts
intermediate reasoning without presenting pragmatic theories (0-shot
Chain-of-Thought), our methods enabled language models to achieve up to 9.6\%
higher scores on pragmatic reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we show that even
without explaining the details of pragmatic theories, merely mentioning their
names in the prompt leads to a certain performance improvement (around 1-3%) in
larger models compared to the baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究预训练语言模型是否具备区分借词和原生词汇的能力，特别是在双语社区中主导语言对少数民族语言施加词汇压力的情况下。

Method: 评估多个预训练语言模型（包括大语言模型）在10种语言上的借词识别能力，使用显式指令和上下文信息。

Result: 尽管提供了显式指令和上下文信息，模型在区分借词和原生词汇方面表现不佳，证实了现代NLP系统对借词存在偏见。

Conclusion: 研究结果对开发少数民族语言的NLP工具和支持面临主导语言词汇压力的语言保护工作具有重要意义。

Abstract: Throughout language history, words are borrowed from one language to another
and gradually become integrated into the recipient's lexicon. Speakers can
often differentiate these loanwords from native vocabulary, particularly in
bilingual communities where a dominant language continuously imposes lexical
items on a minority language. This paper investigates whether pretrained
language models, including large language models, possess similar capabilities
for loanword identification. We evaluate multiple models across 10 languages.
Despite explicit instructions and contextual information, our results show that
models perform poorly in distinguishing loanwords from native ones. These
findings corroborate previous evidence that modern NLP systems exhibit a bias
toward loanwords rather than native equivalents. Our work has implications for
developing NLP tools for minority languages and supporting language
preservation in communities under lexical pressure from dominant languages.

TL;DR: 本文对多语言视觉语言模型的知识蒸馏进行了实证研究，发现不同蒸馏方法在模型压缩时对跨语言表示一致性和下游任务性能稳定性有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在多语言环境下性能不均衡，特别是在模型尺寸减小时问题更加严重。知识蒸馏虽然能在大模型向小模型传递知识方面取得不错效果，但在多语言场景下的应用研究不足。

Method: 研究了五种知识蒸馏方法在CLIP和SigLIP2模型上的表现，评估了它们在领域内检索和领域外视觉问答任务中的效果。

Result: 研究发现某些蒸馏配置能在模型尺寸减半的情况下保持甚至提升多语言检索的鲁棒性，但其他方法无法维持跨任务稳定性，揭示了仅靠聚合准确率无法反映的设计敏感权衡。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏在多语言视觉语言模型压缩中具有重要作用，但需要仔细选择蒸馏方法以确保跨语言表示一致性和下游任务性能稳定性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit uneven performance across languages, a
problem that is often exacerbated when the model size is reduced. While
Knowledge distillation (KD) demonstrates promising results in transferring
knowledge from larger to smaller VLMs, applying KD in multilingualism is an
underexplored area. This paper presents a controlled empirical study of KD
behavior across five distillation approaches, isolating their effects on
cross-lingual representation consistency and downstream performance stability
under model compression. We study five distillation formulations across CLIP
and SigLIP2, and evaluate them on in-domain retrieval and out-of-domain visual
QA. We find that some configurations preserve or even improve multilingual
retrieval robustness despite halving model size, but others fail to maintain
cross-task stability, exposing design-sensitive trade-offs that aggregate
accuracy alone does not reveal.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Neuron Agreement Decoding (NAD)方法，基于神经元激活的内部信号进行无监督集成解码，通过激活稀疏性和跨样本神经元一致性来选择最佳候选答案，显著减少token使用并保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖外部输出信号（如token概率、熵或自评估），这些信号在训练后可能校准不佳。研究发现内部神经元激活包含更丰富的信息，正确回答激活更少的独特神经元且跨样本一致性更强。

Method: NAD方法分析神经元激活模式，利用激活稀疏性和跨样本神经元一致性作为选择标准，无需可比较的文本输出，支持早期正确预测和激进早停。

Result: 在数学和科学基准测试中与多数投票相当；在开放式编码基准测试中优于Avg@64；通过早期修剪减少99%的token使用，生成质量损失极小。

Conclusion: 内部信号为无标签集成解码提供了可靠、可扩展且高效的指导，神经元激活模式是比外部信号更优的候选答案选择指标。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) commonly boost reasoning via
sample-evaluate-ensemble decoders, achieving label free gains without ground
truth. However, prevailing strategies score candidates using only external
outputs such as token probabilities, entropies, or self evaluations, and these
signals can be poorly calibrated after post training. We instead analyze
internal behavior based on neuron activations and uncover three findings: (1)
external signals are low dimensional projections of richer internal dynamics;
(2) correct responses activate substantially fewer unique neurons than
incorrect ones throughout generation; and (3) activations from correct
responses exhibit stronger cross sample agreement, whereas incorrect ones
diverge. Motivated by these observations, we propose Neuron Agreement Decoding
(NAD), an unsupervised best-of-N method that selects candidates using
activation sparsity and cross sample neuron agreement, operating solely on
internal signals and without requiring comparable textual outputs. NAD enables
early correctness prediction within the first 32 generated tokens and supports
aggressive early stopping. Across math and science benchmarks with verifiable
answers, NAD matches majority voting; on open ended coding benchmarks where
majority voting is inapplicable, NAD consistently outperforms Avg@64. By
pruning unpromising trajectories early, NAD reduces token usage by 99% with
minimal loss in generation quality, showing that internal signals provide
reliable, scalable, and efficient guidance for label free ensemble decoding.

Motivation: 解释LLMs在数字处理中表面错误与准确输入嵌入表示之间的冲突，探索语言模型如何处理数字并量化这些机制的准确性下限。

Method: 分析不同语言模型的数字表示，创建通用探针来追踪信息到特定层，包括输出错误的来源。

Result: 发现尽管存在表面错误，但不同LLMs学习到可互换的、系统化的、高度准确的数字表示，这些表示在隐藏状态和输入上下文类型中具有通用性。

Conclusion: 为预训练LLMs如何操作数字提供了基本理解，并指出了更准确探针技术在改进LLMs架构方面的潜力。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that different large language models (LLMs) converge to
similar and accurate input embedding representations for numbers. These
findings conflict with the documented propensity of LLMs to produce erroneous
outputs when dealing with numeric information. In this work, we aim to explain
this conflict by exploring how language models manipulate numbers and quantify
the lower bounds of accuracy of these mechanisms. We find that despite
surfacing errors, different language models learn interchangeable
representations of numbers that are systematic, highly accurate and universal
across their hidden states and the types of input contexts. This allows us to
create universal probes for each LLM and to trace information -- including the
causes of output errors -- to specific layers. Our results lay a fundamental
understanding of how pre-trained LLMs manipulate numbers and outline the
potential of more accurate probing techniques in addressed refinements of LLMs'
architectures.

TL;DR: 评估ChatGPT Atlas在网页游戏中的交互能力，发现在逻辑推理任务中表现优异，但在需要实时反应和精确控制的游戏中表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Atlas在信息检索任务中表现出色，但其在动态交互环境中的能力尚未充分探索，因此使用网页游戏作为测试场景进行评估。

Method: 使用Google的T-Rex Runner、数独、Flappy Bird和Stein.world等网页游戏作为测试场景，以游戏内表现为量化指标评估不同任务类型的表现。

Result: Atlas在数独等逻辑推理任务中表现强劲，完成速度显著快于人类基准，但在需要精确时机和运动控制的实时游戏中表现不佳，往往无法通过初始障碍。

Conclusion: Atlas具备强大的分析处理能力，但在需要实时交互的动态网页环境中仍存在明显局限性。

Abstract: OpenAI's ChatGPT Atlas introduces new capabilities for web interaction,
enabling the model to analyze webpages, process user intents, and execute
cursor and keyboard inputs directly within the browser. While its capacity for
information retrieval tasks has been demonstrated, its performance in dynamic,
interactive environments remains less explored. In this study, we conduct an
early evaluation of Atlas's web interaction capabilities using browser-based
games as test scenarios, including Google's T-Rex Runner, Sudoku, Flappy Bird,
and Stein.world. We employ in-game performance scores as quantitative metrics
to assess performance across different task types. Our results show that Atlas
performs strongly in logical reasoning tasks like Sudoku, completing puzzles
significantly faster than human baselines, but struggles substantially in
real-time games requiring precise timing and motor control, often failing to
progress beyond initial obstacles. These findings suggest that while Atlas
demonstrates capable analytical processing, there remain notable limitations in
dynamic web environments requiring real-time interaction. The website of our
project can be found at https://atlas-game-eval.github.io.

key challenges: privacy concerns, limited computational resources, and the need
for pedagogically valid responses. These constraints require small, open-source
models that can run locally and reliably ground their outputs in correct
information. We introduce SCRIBE, a framework for multi-hop, tool-augmented
reasoning designed to generate valid responses to student questions about
feedback reports. SCRIBE combines domain-specific tools with a self-reflective
inference pipeline that supports iterative reasoning, tool use, and error
recovery. We distil these capabilities into 3B and 8B models via two-stage LoRA
fine-tuning on synthetic GPT-4o-generated data. Evaluation with a human-aligned
GPT-Judge and a user study with 108 students shows that 8B-SCRIBE models
achieve comparable or superior quality to much larger models in key dimensions
such as relevance and actionability, while being perceived on par with GPT-4o
and Llama-3.3 70B by students. These findings demonstrate the viability of
SCRIBE for low-resource, privacy-sensitive educational applications.

TL;DR: ACER通过自动生成教科书式课程，将通用大语言模型转化为领域专家，在保持广泛能力的同时显著提升专业领域表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在通用任务上表现出色，但在需要深度原理性理解的专业领域（如经济学、心理学）表现不佳，存在关键领域差距。

Method: ACER首先为学科生成目录结构，然后基于布鲁姆分类法创建问答对，构建系统化课程。使用交错课程安排进行持续预训练，在内容和认知维度上对齐学习。

Result: 在Llama 3.2模型上，ACER在专业MMLU子集上显著提升，微观经济学准确率提高5个百分点，所有目标领域平均提升3个百分点。同时防止灾难性遗忘，促进跨领域知识迁移，非目标领域性能也提升0.7点。

Conclusion: ACER提供了一个可扩展且有效的方法，能够显著缩小LLMs在关键领域的性能差距，同时保持通用推理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at general tasks but underperform in
specialized domains like economics and psychology, which require deep,
principled understanding. To address this, we introduce ACER (Automated
Curriculum-Enhanced Regimen) that transforms generalist models into domain
experts without sacrificing their broad capabilities. ACER first synthesizes a
comprehensive, textbook-style curriculum by generating a table of contents for
a subject and then creating question-answer (QA) pairs guided by Bloom's
taxonomy. This ensures systematic topic coverage and progressively increasing
difficulty. The resulting synthetic corpus is used for continual pretraining
with an interleaved curriculum schedule, aligning learning across both content
and cognitive dimensions.
  Experiments with Llama 3.2 (1B and 3B) show significant gains in specialized
MMLU subsets. In challenging domains like microeconomics, where baselines
struggle, ACER boosts accuracy by 5 percentage points. Across all target
domains, we observe a consistent macro-average improvement of 3 percentage
points. Notably, ACER not only prevents catastrophic forgetting but also
facilitates positive cross-domain knowledge transfer, improving performance on
non-target domains by 0.7 points. Beyond MMLU, ACER enhances performance on
knowledge-intensive benchmarks like ARC and GPQA by over 2 absolute points,
while maintaining stable performance on general reasoning tasks. Our results
demonstrate that ACER offers a scalable and effective recipe for closing
critical domain gaps in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出MisSynth管道，使用检索增强生成(RAG)创建合成谬误样本，通过轻量级微调提升大语言模型识别科学健康相关错误信息的能力，在有限计算资源下显著提升分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 健康相关错误信息普遍存在且有害，特别是那些曲解科学发现的论点难以识别，需要有效的方法来增强LLM识别谬误论点的能力。

Method: 使用检索增强生成(RAG)生成合成谬误样本，然后对LLM模型进行轻量级微调，在MISSCI数据集和框架上进行实验。

Result: 微调模型相比原始基线获得显著准确度提升，LLaMA 3.1 8B微调模型在MISSCI测试集上F1分数绝对提升超过35%。

Conclusion: 引入合成谬误数据增强有限标注资源，可以显著提升LLM在真实世界科学错误信息任务上的零样本分类性能，即使在有限计算资源下也能实现。

Abstract: Health-related misinformation is very prevalent and potentially harmful. It
is difficult to identify, especially when claims distort or misinterpret
scientific findings. We investigate the impact of synthetic data generation and
lightweight fine-tuning techniques on the ability of large language models
(LLMs) to recognize fallacious arguments using the MISSCI dataset and
framework. In this work, we propose MisSynth, a pipeline that applies
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to produce synthetic fallacy samples,
which are then used to fine-tune an LLM model. Our results show substantial
accuracy gains with fine-tuned models compared to vanilla baselines. For
instance, the LLaMA 3.1 8B fine-tuned model achieved an over 35% F1-score
absolute improvement on the MISSCI test split over its vanilla baseline. We
demonstrate that introducing synthetic fallacy data to augment limited
annotated resources can significantly enhance zero-shot LLM classification
performance on real-world scientific misinformation tasks, even with limited
computational resources. The code and synthetic dataset are available on

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于交互的自动团队构建框架，通过分析语言模型之间的对话语义连贯性来发现协同模型集群，无需先验知识即可构建高效的多智能体LLM团队。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体方法虽然有望超越单一模型能力，但成功关键在于协同团队组合。由于大多数模型的不透明性，难以了解其内部特性以进行有效协作。

Method: 构建'语言模型图'来映射模型间关系，基于成对对话的语义连贯性，然后应用社区检测识别协同模型集群。通过特定主题引导对话来识别协同团队。

Result: 实验表明该方法能发现功能一致的模型组，反映其潜在专业化。识别的协同团队在下游基准测试中优于随机基线，与基于已知模型专业化的手动构建团队准确率相当。

Conclusion: 为自动设计协作多智能体LLM团队提供了新的基础，无需模型内部架构、训练数据或任务表现的先验知识。

Abstract: While a multi-agent approach based on large language models (LLMs) represents
a promising strategy to surpass the capabilities of single models, its success
is critically dependent on synergistic team composition. However, forming
optimal teams is a significant challenge, as the inherent opacity of most
models obscures the internal characteristics necessary for effective
collaboration. In this paper, we propose an interaction-centric framework for
automatic team composition that does not require any prior knowledge including
their internal architectures, training data, or task performances. Our method
constructs a "language model graph" that maps relationships between models from
the semantic coherence of pairwise conversations, and then applies community
detection to identify synergistic model clusters. Our experiments with diverse
LLMs demonstrate that the proposed method discovers functionally coherent
groups that reflect their latent specializations. Priming conversations with
specific topics identified synergistic teams which outperform random baselines
on downstream benchmarks and achieve comparable accuracy to that of
manually-curated teams based on known model specializations. Our findings
provide a new basis for the automated design of collaborative multi-agent LLM
teams.

Motivation: 随着生成式AI在科学工作流中的使用增加，作者希望探索如何使用语篇层面的信息来为AI生成的科学主张提供支持证据，而推断科学写作中的语篇结构是实现这一目标的第一步。

Method: 使用预训练语言模型和大语言模型进行语篇关系分类，特别关注科学出版物这一较少研究的文本类型，并研究上下文（定义为语篇结构）如何帮助语篇关系分类任务。

Result: 实验表明，基于语篇结构定义的上下文通常对语篇关系分类任务有帮助，并分析了哪些科学语篇关系类型可能从上下文中获益最多。

Conclusion: 这项初步调查证实了上下文在科学语篇关系分类中的重要性，为使用语篇信息支持AI生成科学主张的验证提供了基础。

Abstract: With the increasing use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods to
support science workflows, we are interested in the use of discourse-level
information to find supporting evidence for AI generated scientific claims. A
first step towards this objective is to examine the task of inferring discourse
structure in scientific writing.
  In this work, we present a preliminary investigation of pretrained language
model (PLM) and Large Language Model (LLM) approaches for Discourse Relation
Classification (DRC), focusing on scientific publications, an under-studied
genre for this task. We examine how context can help with the DRC task, with
our experiments showing that context, as defined by discourse structure, is
generally helpful. We also present an analysis of which scientific discourse
relation types might benefit most from context.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了OmniEduBench，一个全面的中文教育基准，包含24.6K高质量问答对，涵盖知识和素养两个维度，共61个学科和11种题型。实验显示主流LLMs在教育领域仍有很大提升空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs和基准主要关注知识维度，忽视了教育场景中重要的素养能力评估，且在中文语境下缺乏多样性。

Method: 构建包含24.602K问答对的综合基准，分为知识维度(18.121K)和素养维度(6.481K)，各细分为6个类别，覆盖61个学科和11种题型。

Result: 在11个主流LLMs上的实验显示：知识维度仅Gemini-2.5 Pro超过60%准确率；素养维度最佳模型QWQ仍落后人类智能近30%。

Conclusion: LLMs在教育应用方面仍有显著改进空间，当前模型在素养维度表现尤其不足，凸显了教育领域LLM应用的挑战。

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), various LLM-based
works have been widely applied in educational fields. However, most existing
LLMs and their benchmarks focus primarily on the knowledge dimension, largely
neglecting the evaluation of cultivation capabilities that are essential for
real-world educational scenarios. Additionally, current benchmarks are often
limited to a single subject or question type, lacking sufficient diversity.
This issue is particularly prominent within the Chinese context. To address
this gap, we introduce OmniEduBench, a comprehensive Chinese educational
benchmark. OmniEduBench consists of 24.602K high-quality question-answer pairs.
The data is meticulously divided into two core dimensions: the knowledge
dimension and the cultivation dimension, which contain 18.121K and 6.481K
entries, respectively. Each dimension is further subdivided into 6 fine-grained
categories, covering a total of 61 different subjects (41 in the knowledge and
20 in the cultivation). Furthermore, the dataset features a rich variety of
question formats, including 11 common exam question types, providing a solid
foundation for comprehensively evaluating LLMs' capabilities in education.
Extensive experiments on 11 mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs
reveal a clear performance gap. In the knowledge dimension, only Gemini-2.5 Pro
surpassed 60\% accuracy, while in the cultivation dimension, the
best-performing model, QWQ, still trailed human intelligence by nearly 30\%.
These results highlight the substantial room for improvement and underscore the
challenges of applying LLMs in education.

TL;DR: SSLC方法结合稀疏优化和低秩逼近来压缩大语言模型，无需额外训练即可实现50%压缩且性能无损，获得1.63倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然表现出色，但其广泛部署受到带宽和计算需求的限制。现有方法如剪枝和低秩逼近各自表现良好，但两者的协同作用尚未充分探索。

Method: 基于理论分析，将低秩逼近和稀疏优化统一为一个问题，并通过迭代优化算法求解，同时保留模型基本结构和关键权重。

Result: 在LLaMA和Qwen2.5模型(7B-70B)上的实验表明，SSLC无需额外训练就能超越单独方法，达到最先进结果。Qwen2.5压缩50%无性能损失，至少获得1.63倍加速。

Conclusion: SSLC为大语言模型的高效部署提供了实用解决方案，通过协同稀疏和低秩压缩实现显著性能提升。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
language comprehension and generation; however, their widespread adoption is
constrained by substantial bandwidth and computational demands. While pruning
and low-rank approximation have each demonstrated promising performance
individually, their synergy for LLMs remains underexplored. We introduce
\underline{S}ynergistic \underline{S}parse and \underline{L}ow-Rank
\underline{C}ompression (SSLC) methods for LLMs, which leverages the strengths
of both techniques: low-rank approximation compresses the model by retaining
its essential structure with minimal information loss, whereas sparse
optimization eliminates non-essential weights, preserving those crucial for
generalization. Based on theoretical analysis, we first formulate the low-rank
approximation and sparse optimization as a unified problem and solve it by
iterative optimization algorithm. Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen2.5 models
(7B-70B) show that SSLC, without any additional training steps, consistently
surpasses standalone methods, achieving state-of-the-arts results. Notably,
SSLC compresses Qwen2.5 by 50\% with no performance drop and achieves at least
1.63$\times$ speedup, offering a practical solution for efficient LLM
deployment.

Motivation: 解决领域特定LLM缺乏透明度、微调成本高、需要大量提示工程、跨领域结果不一致以及高计算需求带来的环境问题。

Method: 使用贝叶斯网络LLM融合框架，将FinBERT、RoBERTa和BERTweet三个LLM的情感预测建模为概率节点进行后期融合。

Result: 在三个具有不同语言和上下文特征的人工标注金融语料库上评估，BNLF相比基线LLM准确率一致提升约6%。

Conclusion: BNLF对数据集变异性具有鲁棒性，概率融合方法在可解释情感分类中有效。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, with an increasing number
of domain-specific variants tailored for specialised tasks. However, these
models often lack transparency and explainability, can be costly to fine-tune,
require substantial prompt engineering, yield inconsistent results across
domains, and impose significant adverse environmental impact due to their high
computational demands. To address these challenges, we propose the Bayesian
network LLM fusion (BNLF) framework, which integrates predictions from three
LLMs, including FinBERT, RoBERTa, and BERTweet, through a probabilistic
mechanism for sentiment analysis. BNLF performs late fusion by modelling the
sentiment predictions from multiple LLMs as probabilistic nodes within a
Bayesian network. Evaluated across three human-annotated financial corpora with
distinct linguistic and contextual characteristics, BNLF demonstrates
consistent gains of about six percent in accuracy over the baseline LLMs,
underscoring its robustness to dataset variability and the effectiveness of
probabilistic fusion for interpretable sentiment classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确定多个LLM代理的集成是否比单一LLM能提供更可靠的AI分诊工具评估，以提高评估的准确性和一致性。

Method: 分析了29,766个非对比CT头部检查，使用八个开源LLM模型和GPT-4o的集成，通过多示例提示评估颅内出血（ICH）的存在。比较了不同模型的性能特征和共识方法。

Result: Llama3.3:70b和GPT-4o表现最佳（AUC=0.78）。Llama3.3:70b在F1分数、召回率、精确度、特异性和MCC方面表现最好。集成方法（Full-9、Top-3、Consensus）在MCC方面优于单一GPT-4o，且集成方法之间无显著差异。

Conclusion: 中等至大型开源LLM集成比单一LLM提供了更一致和可靠的方法来评估临床AI分诊工具，是进行回顾性评估的优选方法。

Abstract: Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine if an ensemble of
multiple LLM agents could be used collectively to provide a more reliable
assessment of a pixel-based AI triage tool than a single LLM.
  Methods: 29,766 non-contrast CT head exams from fourteen hospitals were
processed by a commercial intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) AI detection tool.
Radiology reports were analyzed by an ensemble of eight open-source LLM models
and a HIPAA compliant internal version of GPT-4o using a single multi-shot
prompt that assessed for presence of ICH. 1,726 examples were manually
reviewed. Performance characteristics of the eight open-source models and
consensus were compared to GPT-4o. Three ideal consensus LLM ensembles were
tested for rating the performance of the triage tool.
  Results: The cohort consisted of 29,766 head CTs exam-report pairs. The
highest AUC performance was achieved with llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AUC= 0.78).
The average precision was highest for Llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AP=0.75 & 0.76).
Llama3.3:70b had the highest F1 score (0.81) and recall (0.85), greater
precision (0.78), specificity (0.72), and MCC (0.57). Using MCC (95% CI) the
ideal combination of LLMs were: Full-9 Ensemble 0.571 (0.552-0.591), Top-3
Ensemble 0.558 (0.537-0.579), Consensus 0.556 (0.539-0.574), and GPT4o 0.522
(0.500-0.543). No statistically significant differences were observed between
Top-3, Full-9, and Consensus (p > 0.05).
  Conclusion: An ensemble of medium to large sized open-source LLMs provides a
more consistent and reliable method to derive a ground truth retrospective
evaluation of a clinical AI triage tool over a single LLM alone.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从复杂法律文本中构建知识图谱时面临的节点重复和噪声问题，现有LLM方法缺乏引导提取和共指消解。

Method: 使用CORE-KG框架进行系统消融研究，分别移除共指消解模块和结构化提示，量化其对节点重复和噪声的影响。

Result: 移除共指消解导致节点重复增加28.32%，噪声节点增加4.32%；移除结构化提示导致节点重复增加4.34%，噪声节点增加73.33%。

Conclusion: 结构化提示对减少噪声更关键，共指消解对减少节点重复更重要，为设计稳健的LLM知识图谱提取流程提供了实证依据。

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are increasingly adaptive and difficult to analyze.
Legal case documents offer critical insights but are often unstructured,
lexically dense, and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, which pose
significant challenges for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. While
recent LLM-based approaches improve over static templates, they still generate
noisy, fragmented graphs with duplicate nodes due to the absence of guided
extraction and coreference resolution. The recently proposed CORE-KG framework
addresses these limitations by integrating a type-aware coreference module and
domain-guided structured prompts, significantly reducing node duplication and
legal noise. In this work, we present a systematic ablation study of CORE-KG to
quantify the individual contributions of its two key components. Our results
show that removing coreference resolution results in a 28.32% increase in node
duplication and a 4.32% increase in noisy nodes, while removing structured
prompts leads to a 4.34% increase in node duplication and a 73.33% increase in
noisy nodes. These findings offer empirical insights for designing robust
LLM-based pipelines for extracting structured representations from complex
legal texts.

Motivation: 希伯来语变音符号恢复对于确保准确发音和消除文本歧义至关重要，尽管未变音文本存在高度歧义性，但机器学习方法在该任务上取得了显著进展。

Method: 将任务构建为基于上下文条件的零样本分类问题，使用希伯来视觉语言模型将未变音文本作为图像处理，从动态生成的候选集中为每个单词选择最合适的变音模式。

Result: 在"oracle"设置下（正确变音形式保证在候选集中），系统达到高准确率；通过架构增强和优化训练方法显著提升了泛化能力。

Conclusion: 视觉表示在准确自动化希伯来语变音符号恢复方面展现出巨大潜力，系统无需依赖复杂的显式语言分析即可有效执行变音任务。

Abstract: Diacritics restoration in Hebrew is a fundamental task for ensuring accurate
word pronunciation and disambiguating textual meaning. Despite the language's
high degree of ambiguity when unvocalized, recent machine learning approaches
have significantly advanced performance on this task.
  In this work, we present DIVRIT, a novel system for Hebrew diacritization
that frames the task as a zero-shot classification problem. Our approach
operates at the word level, selecting the most appropriate diacritization
pattern for each undiacritized word from a dynamically generated candidate set,
conditioned on the surrounding textual context. A key innovation of DIVRIT is
its use of a Hebrew Visual Language Model, which processes undiacritized text
as an image, allowing diacritic information to be embedded directly within the
input's vector representation.
  Through a comprehensive evaluation across various configurations, we
demonstrate that the system effectively performs diacritization without relying
on complex, explicit linguistic analysis. Notably, in an ``oracle'' setting
where the correct diacritized form is guaranteed to be among the provided
candidates, DIVRIT achieves a high level of accuracy. Furthermore, strategic
architectural enhancements and optimized training methodologies yield
significant improvements in the system's overall generalization capabilities.
These findings highlight the promising potential of visual representations for
accurate and automated Hebrew diacritization.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了Transformer语言模型中线性关系解码器的结构，发现它们不是编码特定关系，而是提取重复的粗粒度语义属性，这解释了其高压缩性和有限的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展Hernandez等人[2023]的单关系发现，系统性地探索多个关系解码器的组织结构，解释其为何能被高度压缩且泛化能力有限。

Method: 使用简单的三阶张量网络压缩关系解码器集合，开发交叉评估协议，将每个线性解码器应用于其他关系的主题。

Result: 发现线性映射不编码不同关系，而是提取重复的粗粒度语义属性（如国家属性），这解释了操作符的可压缩性。

Conclusion: Transformer语言模型中的线性关系解码主要是基于属性的，而非关系特定的，这阐明了其压缩性和泛化特性。

Abstract: This paper investigates the structure of linear operators introduced in
Hernandez et al. [2023] that decode specific relational facts in transformer
language models. We extend their single-relation findings to a collection of
relations and systematically chart their organization. We show that such
collections of relation decoders can be highly compressed by simple order-3
tensor networks without significant loss in decoding accuracy. To explain this
surprising redundancy, we develop a cross-evaluation protocol, in which we
apply each linear decoder operator to the subjects of every other relation. Our
results reveal that these linear maps do not encode distinct relations, but
extract recurring, coarse-grained semantic properties (e.g., country of capital
city and country of food are both in the country-of-X property). This
property-centric structure clarifies both the operators' compressibility and
highlights why they generalize only to new relations that are semantically
close. Our findings thus interpret linear relational decoding in transformer
language models as primarily property-based, rather than relation-specific.

TL;DR: 本文提出了InfoFlow框架来解决强化学习中奖励密度低的问题，通过子问题分解、失败引导提示和双智能体精炼三种方法，显著提高了探索效率和奖励密度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在深度搜索场景中，强化学习面临奖励密度低的问题，智能体需要付出大量探索成本却只能获得稀疏的最终奖励，这阻碍了RLVR方法的应用。

Method: InfoFlow框架包含三个核心组件：1）子问题分解：将长程任务分解为子任务并分配过程奖励；2）失败引导提示：向停滞轨迹注入纠正指导；3）双智能体精炼：使用研究者和精炼者双智能体架构来减轻深度探索的认知负担。

Result: 在多个智能搜索基准测试中，InfoFlow显著优于强基线方法，使轻量级LLM能够达到与先进专有LLM相当的性能。

Conclusion: InfoFlow通过提高奖励密度有效解决了深度搜索中的探索效率问题，为强化学习在复杂任务中的应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach
for enhancing agentic deep search. However, its application is often hindered
by low \textbf{Reward Density} in deep search scenarios, where agents expend
significant exploratory costs for infrequent and often null final rewards. In
this paper, we formalize this challenge as the \textbf{Reward Density
Optimization} problem, which aims to improve the reward obtained per unit of
exploration cost. This paper introduce \textbf{InfoFlow}, a systematic
framework that tackles this problem from three aspects. 1) \textbf{Subproblem
decomposition}: breaking down long-range tasks to assign process rewards,
thereby providing denser learning signals. 2) \textbf{Failure-guided hints}:
injecting corrective guidance into stalled trajectories to increase the
probability of successful outcomes. 3) \textbf{Dual-agent refinement}:
employing a dual-agent architecture to offload the cognitive burden of deep
exploration. A refiner agent synthesizes the search history, which effectively
compresses the researcher's perceived trajectory, thereby reducing exploration
cost and increasing the overall reward density. We evaluate InfoFlow on
multiple agentic search benchmarks, where it significantly outperforms strong
baselines, enabling lightweight LLMs to achieve performance comparable to
advanced proprietary LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型由于自回归设计和大型规模导致的推理延迟问题，现有推测解码方法如EAGLE-2和EAGLE-3忽略了GPU设备和批量大小等关键系统变量的影响。

Method: 引入CAST动态树解码方法，综合考虑推理成本（包括GPU配置和批量大小）来动态优化树结构。

Result: 在6个多样化任务和6个不同LLM上的实验表明，该方法比传统解码方法快达5.2倍，通常比现有最优技术提升5%-20%。

Conclusion: CAST方法通过考虑系统变量动态优化树结构，显著提升了LLM的推理效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant inference latency challenges
stemming from their autoregressive design and large size. To address this,
speculative decoding emerges as a solution, enabling the simultaneous
generation and validation of multiple tokens. While recent approaches like
EAGLE-2 and EAGLE-3 improve speculative decoding using dynamic tree structures,
they often neglect the impact of crucial system variables such as GPU devices
and batch sizes.
  Therefore, we introduce a new dynamic tree decoding approach called CAST that
takes into account inference costs, including factors such as GPU
configurations and batch sizes, to dynamically refine the tree structure.
Through comprehensive experimentation across six diverse tasks and utilizing
six distinct LLMs, our methodology demonstrates remarkable results, achieving
speeds up to 5.2 times faster than conventional decoding methods. Moreover, it

*Yiqiao Jin,Rachneet Kaur,Zhen Zeng,Sumitra Ganesh,Srijan Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SlideAgent是一个用于理解多页视觉文档的智能代理框架，通过三层专门化代理进行全局、页面和元素级别的推理，显著提升了文档理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前系统在处理复杂的多页视觉文档时存在困难，特别是在对元素和页面进行细粒度推理方面。大型语言模型虽然提供了文档理解的机会，但需要更好的方法来处理多模态、多页面和多布局的文档。

Method: 采用专门化代理框架，将推理分解为三个层次：全局、页面和元素级别，构建结构化、查询无关的表示，捕捉整体主题和详细视觉/文本线索。在推理时选择性激活专门化代理进行多级推理并整合输出。

Result: 在广泛实验中，SlideAgent相比专有模型整体提升7.9%，相比开源模型整体提升9.8%，取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: SlideAgent框架通过分层专门化代理的方法，有效解决了多页视觉文档理解中的挑战，为复杂文档分析提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-page visual documents such as manuals, brochures, presentations, and
posters convey key information through layout, colors, icons, and cross-slide
references. While large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities in document
understanding, current systems struggle with complex, multi-page visual
documents, particularly in fine-grained reasoning over elements and pages. We
introduce SlideAgent, a versatile agentic framework for understanding
multi-modal, multi-page, and multi-layout documents, especially slide decks.
SlideAgent employs specialized agents and decomposes reasoning into three
specialized levels-global, page, and element-to construct a structured,
query-agnostic representation that captures both overarching themes and
detailed visual or textual cues. During inference, SlideAgent selectively
activates specialized agents for multi-level reasoning and integrates their
outputs into coherent, context-aware answers. Extensive experiments show that
SlideAgent achieves significant improvement over both proprietary (+7.9
overall) and open-source models (+9.8 overall).

*Biao Zhang,Yong Cheng,Siamak Shakeri,Xinyi Wang,Min Ma,Orhan Firat*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文重新审视编码器-解码器架构的LLM（RedLLM），与主流解码器架构（DecLLM）进行多尺度对比，发现RedLLM具有竞争力的扩展性能和推理效率优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM研究快速转向解码器架构，但缺乏从扩展角度对编码器-解码器模型的严谨比较，可能低估了其潜力。

Method: 使用前缀语言建模预训练RedLLM，应用解码器LLM的最新配方，在150M到8B参数规模上进行全面比较，使用RedPajama V1预训练和FLAN指令调优。

Result: RedLLM展现出令人信服的扩展特性和强大性能，在指令调优后在下游任务上达到可比甚至更好的结果，同时推理效率显著更高。

Conclusion: 编码器-解码器LLM具有被低估的潜力，值得重新审视以开发更强大高效的LLM。

Abstract: Recent large language model (LLM) research has undergone an architectural
shift from encoder-decoder modeling to nowadays the dominant decoder-only
modeling. This rapid transition, however, comes without a rigorous comparative
analysis especially \textit{from the scaling perspective}, raising concerns
that the potential of encoder-decoder models may have been overlooked. To fill
this gap, we revisit encoder-decoder LLM (RedLLM), enhancing it with recent
recipes from decoder-only LLM (DecLLM). We conduct a comprehensive comparison
between RedLLM, pretrained with prefix language modeling (LM), and DecLLM,
pretrained with causal LM, at different model scales, ranging from $\sim$150M
to $\sim$8B. Using RedPajama V1 (1.6T tokens) for pretraining and FLAN for
instruction tuning, our experiments show that RedLLM produces compelling
scaling properties and surprisingly strong performance. While DecLLM is overall
more compute-optimal during pretraining, RedLLM demonstrates comparable scaling
and context length extrapolation capabilities. After instruction tuning, RedLLM
achieves comparable and even better results on various downstream tasks while
enjoying substantially better inference efficiency. We hope our findings could
inspire more efforts on re-examining RedLLM, unlocking its potential for
developing powerful and efficient LLMs.

TL;DR: Evontree是一个利用少量高质量本体规则从LLMs中系统提取、验证和增强领域知识的框架，无需大量外部数据集，在医疗QA基准测试中表现优于未修改模型和领先监督基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗等数据敏感领域，缺乏高质量领域特定训练语料阻碍了LLMs的专业应用，而领域专家已将领域智慧提炼成本体规则。

Method: Evontree从原始模型中提取领域本体，使用两个核心本体规则检测不一致性，并通过自蒸馏微调强化精炼后的知识。

Result: 在Llama3-8B-Instruct和Med42-v2上的医疗QA基准测试中，相比未修改模型和领先监督基线，准确率提升高达3.7%。

Conclusion: 该方法在LLMs的低资源领域适应中展现出有效性、效率和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities
across multiple domains by leveraging massive pre-training and curated
fine-tuning data. However, in data-sensitive fields such as healthcare, the
lack of high-quality, domain-specific training corpus hinders LLMs' adaptation
for specialized applications. Meanwhile, domain experts have distilled domain
wisdom into ontology rules, which formalize relationships among concepts and
ensure the integrity of knowledge management repositories. Viewing LLMs as
implicit repositories of human knowledge, we propose Evontree, a novel
framework that leverages a small set of high-quality ontology rules to
systematically extract, validate, and enhance domain knowledge within LLMs,
without requiring extensive external datasets. Specifically, Evontree extracts
domain ontology from raw models, detects inconsistencies using two core
ontology rules, and reinforces the refined knowledge via self-distilled
fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on medical QA benchmarks with
Llama3-8B-Instruct and Med42-v2 demonstrate consistent outperformance over both
unmodified models and leading supervised baselines, achieving up to a 3.7%
improvement in accuracy. These results confirm the effectiveness, efficiency,
and robustness of our approach for low-resource domain adaptation of LLMs.

TL;DR: Kimi Linear是一种混合线性注意力架构，首次在公平比较下超越全注意力机制，在短上下文、长上下文和强化学习场景中均表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统注意力机制在长序列处理中的计算和内存瓶颈问题，同时保持或提升模型性能。

Method: 采用Kimi Delta Attention (KDA)线性注意力模块，结合更细粒度的门控机制，并使用专门设计的块状算法和Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank (DPLR)转换矩阵来提高硬件效率。

Result: 3B激活参数的Kimi Linear模型在所有评估任务中显著优于全MLA模型，减少KV缓存使用达75%，在1M上下文长度下实现6倍解码吞吐量。

Conclusion: Kimi Linear可以作为全注意力架构的即插即用替代方案，提供更优的性能和效率，特别适用于长输入和输出长度的任务。

Abstract: We introduce Kimi Linear, a hybrid linear attention architecture that, for
the first time, outperforms full attention under fair comparisons across
various scenarios -- including short-context, long-context, and reinforcement
learning (RL) scaling regimes. At its core lies Kimi Delta Attention (KDA), an
expressive linear attention module that extends Gated DeltaNet with a
finer-grained gating mechanism, enabling more effective use of limited
finite-state RNN memory. Our bespoke chunkwise algorithm achieves high hardware
efficiency through a specialized variant of the Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank (DPLR)
transition matrices, which substantially reduces computation compared to the
general DPLR formulation while remaining more consistent with the classical
delta rule.
  We pretrain a Kimi Linear model with 3B activated parameters and 48B total
parameters, based on a layerwise hybrid of KDA and Multi-Head Latent Attention
(MLA). Our experiments show that with an identical training recipe, Kimi Linear
outperforms full MLA with a sizeable margin across all evaluated tasks, while
reducing KV cache usage by up to 75% and achieving up to 6 times decoding
throughput for a 1M context. These results demonstrate that Kimi Linear can be
a drop-in replacement for full attention architectures with superior
performance and efficiency, including tasks with longer input and output
lengths.
  To support further research, we open-source the KDA kernel and vLLM
implementations, and release the pre-trained and instruction-tuned model
checkpoints.

TL;DR: AutoDeco是一个新的LLM架构，通过在标准transformer上添加轻量级头，实现真正的端到端生成，让模型能够动态预测温度值和top-p值来控制解码策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs的"端到端"标签是误导性的，因为它们依赖于需要手动调整超参数的非可微解码过程，这需要大量人工调优。

Method: 在标准transformer基础上添加轻量级头，在每个步骤动态预测上下文特定的温度值和top-p值以及下一个token的logits，将解码转变为参数化的token级过程。

Result: 在八个基准测试中，AutoDeco不仅显著优于默认解码策略，还达到了与通过"hacking测试集"得到的oracle调优基线相当的性能。模型还展现出基于指令的解码控制能力。

Conclusion: AutoDeco开启了可引导和交互式LLM解码的新范式，模型能够理解自然语言指令并逐token调整预测的温度和top-p值。

Abstract: The "end-to-end" label for LLMs is a misnomer. In practice, they depend on a
non-differentiable decoding process that requires laborious, hand-tuning of
hyperparameters like temperature and top-p. This paper introduces AutoDeco, a
novel architecture that enables truly "end-to-end" generation by learning to
control its own decoding strategy. We augment the standard transformer with
lightweight heads that, at each step, dynamically predict context-specific
temperature and top-p values alongside the next-token logits. This approach
transforms decoding into a parametric, token-level process, allowing the model
to self-regulate its sampling strategy within a single forward pass.
  Through extensive experiments on eight benchmarks, we demonstrate that
AutoDeco not only significantly outperforms default decoding strategies but
also achieves performance comparable to an oracle-tuned baseline derived from
"hacking the test set"-a practical upper bound for any static method.
Crucially, we uncover an emergent capability for instruction-based decoding
control: the model learns to interpret natural language commands (e.g.,
"generate with low randomness") and adjusts its predicted temperature and top-p
on a token-by-token basis, opening a new paradigm for steerable and interactive
LLM decoding.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了LLM在训练过程中如何以及何时获得价值对齐能力，发现监督微调阶段主要建立模型价值观，而后续的偏好优化很少重新对齐这些价值观。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在社会中扮演越来越重要的角色，需要研究它们如何与人类价值体系对齐。现有工作主要关注完全训练好的模型，而忽略了训练动态过程。

Method: 使用Llama-3和Qwen-3不同规模的模型，结合流行的监督微调和偏好优化数据集与算法，分析价值漂移的幅度和时间。还使用合成偏好数据集进行受控实验。

Result: 监督微调阶段一般建立模型的价值观念，后续的偏好优化很少重新对齐这些价值观。不同的偏好优化算法即使使用相同的偏好数据，也会导致不同的价值对齐结果。

Conclusion: 研究结果为理解后训练过程中价值观如何学习提供了可操作的见解，有助于指导数据筛选以及选择模型和算法来改进模型与人类价值观的对齐。

Abstract: As LLMs occupy an increasingly important role in society, they are more and
more confronted with questions that require them not only to draw on their
general knowledge but also to align with certain human value systems.
Therefore, studying the alignment of LLMs with human values has become a
crucial field of inquiry. Prior work, however, mostly focuses on evaluating the
alignment of fully trained models, overlooking the training dynamics by which
models learn to express human values. In this work, we investigate how and at
which stage value alignment arises during the course of a model's
post-training. Our analysis disentangles the effects of post-training
algorithms and datasets, measuring both the magnitude and time of value drifts
during training. Experimenting with Llama-3 and Qwen-3 models of different
sizes and popular supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference optimization
datasets and algorithms, we find that the SFT phase generally establishes a
model's values, and subsequent preference optimization rarely re-aligns these
values. Furthermore, using a synthetic preference dataset that enables
controlled manipulation of values, we find that different preference
optimization algorithms lead to different value alignment outcomes, even when
preference data is held constant. Our findings provide actionable insights into
how values are learned during post-training and help to inform data curation,
as well as the selection of models and algorithms for preference optimization
to improve model alignment to human values.

TL;DR: AMO-Bench是一个高级数学推理基准，包含50道奥林匹克竞赛难度或更高的人类编写问题，用于评估大型语言模型的数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学竞赛基准对顶级LLMs的评估效果下降，存在性能饱和问题，需要更具挑战性的基准来推动模型发展。

Method: 创建50道经过专家交叉验证、符合IMO难度标准的原创问题，仅要求最终答案以便自动评分。

Result: 在26个LLMs上的实验显示，最佳模型准确率仅为52.4%，大多数模型低于40%，但显示出随测试计算量增加的良好扩展趋势。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在数学推理方面仍有很大改进空间，AMO-Bench为推进语言模型推理能力研究提供了有效基准。

Abstract: We present AMO-Bench, an Advanced Mathematical reasoning benchmark with
Olympiad level or even higher difficulty, comprising 50 human-crafted problems.
Existing benchmarks have widely leveraged high school math competitions for
evaluating mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).
However, many existing math competitions are becoming less effective for
assessing top-tier LLMs due to performance saturation (e.g., AIME24/25). To
address this, AMO-Bench introduces more rigorous challenges by ensuring all 50
problems are (1) cross-validated by experts to meet at least the International
Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) difficulty standards, and (2) entirely original
problems to prevent potential performance leakages from data memorization.
Moreover, each problem in AMO-Bench requires only a final answer rather than a
proof, enabling automatic and robust grading for evaluation. Experimental
results across 26 LLMs on AMO-Bench show that even the best-performing model
achieves only 52.4% accuracy on AMO-Bench, with most LLMs scoring below 40%.
Beyond these poor performances, our further analysis reveals a promising
scaling trend with increasing test-time compute on AMO-Bench. These results
highlight the significant room for improving the mathematical reasoning in
current LLMs. We release AMO-Bench to facilitate further research into
advancing the reasoning abilities of language models.

Motivation: 随着编码代理在大型代码库中部署，需要自动设计具有挑战性的代码库级评估。

Method: 给编码LLM提供完整代码库访问权限和特定入口点，要求生成仅包含必要组件的最小文件来复现相同命令输出。

Result: 当前最先进的模型在可靠解决Gistify任务方面表现不佳，特别是对于执行轨迹较长的任务。

Conclusion: Gistify任务对编码LLM提出了挑战，需要结构理解、执行流建模和大代码补丁生成能力。

Abstract: As coding agents are increasingly deployed in large codebases, the need to
automatically design challenging, codebase-level evaluation is central. We
propose Gistify, a task where a coding LLM must create a single, minimal,
self-contained file that can reproduce a specific functionality of a codebase.
The coding LLM is given full access to a codebase along with a specific
entrypoint (e.g., a python command), and the generated file must replicate the
output of the same command ran under the full codebase, while containing only
the essential components necessary to execute the provided command. Success on
Gistify requires both structural understanding of the codebase, accurate
modeling of its execution flow as well as the ability to produce potentially
large code patches. Our findings show that current state-of-the-art models
struggle to reliably solve Gistify tasks, especially ones with long executions
traces.

Motivation: KANs作为传统多层感知器(MLPs)的有前景替代方案，具有更好的表达能力和可解释性，但缺乏系统性的综述来指导研究和应用。

Method: 收集和分类大量开源实现，建立KANs与MLPs的概念联系，分析不同基函数选择的权衡，并分类技术进步形成发展路线图。

Conclusion: KANs在表达性和可解释性方面具有显著优势，本文为实践者提供了选择适当架构的实用指南，并指出了当前研究空白。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), inspired by the
Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Unlike MLPs, which use fixed
activation functions on nodes, KANs employ learnable univariate basis functions
on edges, offering enhanced expressivity and interpretability. This review
provides a systematic and comprehensive overview of the rapidly expanding KAN
landscape, moving beyond simple performance comparisons to offer a structured
synthesis of theoretical foundations, architectural variants, and practical
implementation strategies. By collecting and categorizing a vast array of
open-source implementations, we map the vibrant ecosystem supporting KAN
development. We begin by bridging the conceptual gap between KANs and MLPs,
establishing their formal equivalence and highlighting the superior parameter
efficiency of the KAN formulation. A central theme of our review is the
critical role of the basis function; we survey a wide array of choices,
including B-splines, Chebyshev and Jacobi polynomials, ReLU compositions,
Gaussian RBFs, and Fourier series, and analyze their respective trade-offs in
terms of smoothness, locality, and computational cost. We then categorize
recent advancements into a clear roadmap, covering techniques for improving
accuracy, efficiency, and regularization. Key topics include physics-informed
loss design, adaptive sampling, domain decomposition, hybrid architectures, and
specialized methods for handling discontinuities. Finally, we provide a
practical "Choose-Your-KAN" guide to help practitioners select appropriate
architectures, and we conclude by identifying current research gaps. The
associated GitHub repository https://github.com/AmirNoori68/kan-review
complements this paper and serves as a structured reference for ongoing KAN

Motivation: 可穿戴传感器提供丰富的生理时间序列数据，但预测效用的基本原则尚不明确。假设时间分辨率是表示学习的基本轴，不同临床和行为结果依赖于不同尺度的结构。

Method: 引入HiMAE（分层掩码自编码器），结合掩码自编码与分层卷积编码器-解码器的自监督框架，生成多分辨率嵌入。

Result: 在分类、回归和生成基准测试中，HiMAE始终优于忽略尺度差异的最先进基础模型，同时模型规模小几个数量级，可在智能手表CPU上实现亚毫秒级推理。

Conclusion: HiMAE既是高效的自监督学习方法，也是发现可穿戴健康数据中尺度敏感结构的发现工具。

Abstract: Wearable sensors provide abundant physiological time series, yet the
principles governing their predictive utility remain unclear. We hypothesize
that temporal resolution is a fundamental axis of representation learning, with
different clinical and behavioral outcomes relying on structure at distinct
scales. To test this resolution hypothesis, we introduce HiMAE (Hierarchical
Masked Autoencoder), a self supervised framework that combines masked
autoencoding with a hierarchical convolutional encoder decoder. HiMAE produces
multi resolution embeddings that enable systematic evaluation of which temporal
scales carry predictive signal, transforming resolution from a hyperparameter
into a probe for interpretability. Across classification, regression, and
generative benchmarks, HiMAE consistently outperforms state of the art
foundation models that collapse scale, while being orders of magnitude smaller.
HiMAE is an efficient representation learner compact enough to run entirely on
watch, achieving sub millisecond inference on smartwatch class CPUs for true
edge inference. Together, these contributions position HiMAE as both an
efficient self supervised learning method and a discovery tool for scale
sensitive structure in wearable health.

Abstract: High-energy materials (HEMs) are critical for propulsion and defense domains,
yet their discovery remains constrained by experimental data and restricted

high-energy molecules by combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for
molecular generation and Attentive Graph Neural Networks (GNN) for property
predictions. We propose a transformative embedding space construction strategy
that integrates fixed SHA-256 embeddings with partially trainable
representations. Unlike conventional regularization techniques, this changes
the representational basis itself, reshaping the molecular input space before
learning begins. Without recourse to pretraining, the generator achieves 67.5%
validity and 37.5% novelty. The generated library exhibits a mean Tanimoto
coefficient of 0.214 relative to training set signifying the ability of
framework to generate a diverse chemical space. We identified 37 new super

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管思维链监督能显著提升Transformer性能，但模型如何学习遵循和受益于CoT的机制尚不清楚，需要深入研究其学习动态。

Method: 在符号推理任务上预训练Transformer，通过可调的算法复杂度和可控的数据组成来研究泛化，比较仅输出最终答案和输出CoT轨迹两种训练设置。

Result: CoT通常能提升任务性能，但效果取决于任务复杂度；早期训练存在推理轨迹不忠实现象；CoT会机制性地改变Transformer的内部计算。

Conclusion: CoT监督加速了泛化过程，但不能克服高算法复杂度任务；推理忠实性是随训练动态出现的特性；需要动力学建模框架来理解Transformer学习过程。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision can substantially improve transformer
performance, yet the mechanisms by which models learn to follow and benefit
from CoT remain poorly understood. We investigate these learning dynamics
through the lens of grokking by pretraining transformers on symbolic reasoning
tasks with tunable algorithmic complexity and controllable data composition to
study their generalization. Models were trained under two settings: (i)
producing only final answers, and (ii) emitting explicit CoT traces before
answering. Our results show that while CoT generally improves task performance,
its benefits depend on task complexity. To quantify these effects, we model the
accuracy of the logarithmic training steps with a three-parameter logistic
curve, revealing how the learning speed and shape vary with task complexity,
data distribution, and the presence of CoT supervision. We also uncover a
transient trace unfaithfulness phase: early in training, models often produce
correct answers while skipping or contradicting CoT steps, before later
aligning their reasoning traces with answers. Empirically, we (1) demonstrate
that CoT accelerates generalization but does not overcome tasks with higher
algorithmic complexity, such as finding list intersections; (2) introduce a
kinetic modeling framework for understanding transformer learning; (3)
characterize trace faithfulness as a dynamic property that emerges over
training; and (4) show CoT alters internal transformer computation
mechanistically.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代多智能体系统（如传感器网络、众包平台）因环境条件变化导致的系统性偏差会显著降低性能，现有方法要么忽略偏差导致次优决策，要么需要昂贵的校准程序。

Method: 开发理论框架将偏差分解为可学习的系统性成分和不可约的随机成分，提出可学习性比率概念，并设计ABLOC算法迭代学习偏差校正变换，同时通过闭式解优化组合权重。

Result: 实验验证表明，具有高可学习性比率的系统可以恢复显著性能（在示例中达到理论最大改进的40%-70%），而低可学习性系统获益甚微。

Conclusion: 可学习性比率决定了偏差学习是否值得投入，为系统设计者提供了何时投资偏差学习与采用更简单方法的定量指导。

Abstract: Modern multi-agent systems ranging from sensor networks monitoring critical
infrastructure to crowdsourcing platforms aggregating human intelligence can
suffer significant performance degradation due to systematic biases that vary
with environmental conditions. Current approaches either ignore these biases,
leading to suboptimal decisions, or require expensive calibration procedures
that are often infeasible in practice. This performance gap has real
consequences: inaccurate environmental monitoring, unreliable financial
predictions, and flawed aggregation of human judgments. This paper addresses
the fundamental question: when can we learn and correct for these unknown
biases to recover near-optimal performance, and when is such learning futile?
We develop a theoretical framework that decomposes biases into learnable
systematic components and irreducible stochastic components, introducing the
concept of learnability ratio as the fraction of bias variance predictable from
observable covariates. This ratio determines whether bias learning is
worthwhile for a given system. We prove that the achievable performance
improvement is fundamentally bounded by this learnability ratio, providing
system designers with quantitative guidance on when to invest in bias learning
versus simpler approaches. We present the Adaptive Bias Learning and Optimal
Combining (ABLOC) algorithm, which iteratively learns bias-correcting
transformations while optimizing combination weights through closedform
solutions, guaranteeing convergence to these theoretical bounds. Experimental
validation demonstrates that systems with high learnability ratios can recover
significant performance (we achieved 40%-70% of theoretical maximum improvement
in our examples), while those with low learnability show minimal benefit,
validating our diagnostic criteria for practical deployment decisions.

*Farnoosh Namdarpour,Joseph Y. J. Chow*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于模拟的强化学习方法来解决拼车系统中的短视决策问题，通过非短视策略显著提高了服务率并减少了乘客等待时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 拼车服务虽然能降低成本和环境影响，但现有决策方法过于短视，忽略了调度决策的长期影响，限制了系统性能。

Method: 将Xu等人(2018)的学习和规划框架从网约车扩展到拼车系统，在强化学习机制中嵌入拼车模拟，并使用n步时序差分学习从模拟经验中学习时空状态值。

Result: 非短视匹配策略相比短视策略可将服务率提高8.4%，减少乘客等待时间和车内时间；车队规模可减少25%以上；加入再平衡操作后等待时间减少27.3%，车内时间减少12.5%，服务率提高15.1%。

Conclusion: 提出的非短视决策框架能显著提升拼车系统性能，为运营商带来显著成本节约，但再平衡操作会增加每乘客的车辆行驶时间。

Abstract: Ride-pooling, also known as ride-sharing, shared ride-hailing, or
microtransit, is a service wherein passengers share rides. This service can
reduce costs for both passengers and operators and reduce congestion and
environmental impacts. A key limitation, however, is its myopic
decision-making, which overlooks long-term effects of dispatch decisions. To
address this, we propose a simulation-informed reinforcement learning (RL)
approach. While RL has been widely studied in the context of ride-hailing
systems, its application in ride-pooling systems has been less explored. In
this study, we extend the learning and planning framework of Xu et al. (2018)
from ride-hailing to ride-pooling by embedding a ride-pooling simulation within
the learning mechanism to enable non-myopic decision-making. In addition, we
propose a complementary policy for rebalancing idle vehicles. By employing
n-step temporal difference learning on simulated experiences, we derive
spatiotemporal state values and subsequently evaluate the effectiveness of the
non-myopic policy using NYC taxi request data. Results demonstrate that the
non-myopic policy for matching can increase the service rate by up to 8.4%
versus a myopic policy while reducing both in-vehicle and wait times for
passengers. Furthermore, the proposed non-myopic policy can decrease fleet size
by over 25% compared to a myopic policy, while maintaining the same level of
performance, thereby offering significant cost savings for operators.
Incorporating rebalancing operations into the proposed framework cuts wait time
by up to 27.3%, in-vehicle time by 12.5%, and raises service rate by 15.1%
compared to using the framework for matching decisions alone at the cost of
increased vehicle minutes traveled per passenger.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MemEIC是一种用于大型视觉语言模型(LVLMs)的持续组合知识编辑方法，通过双外部记忆和双LoRA适配器实现跨模态知识编辑，解决了传统单模态编辑方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识编辑技术通常只关注单一模态(视觉或语言)的编辑，忽视了LVLMs的多模态特性和知识的持续更新需求，导致编辑效果不佳。

Method: 采用混合外部-内部编辑器，包含用于跨模态证据检索的双外部记忆和用于解耦参数更新的双LoRA适配器，以及受大脑启发的知识连接器进行组合推理。

Result: 实验表明MemEIC在复杂多模态问题上显著提升性能，并能有效保留先前的编辑结果，为LVLMs的持续组合知识编辑设定了新基准。

Conclusion: MemEIC通过多模态组合编辑方法，成功解决了LVLMs中知识持续更新的挑战，为未来多模态知识编辑提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The dynamic nature of information necessitates continuously updating large
vision-language models (LVLMs). While recent knowledge editing techniques hint
at promising directions, they often focus on editing a single modality (vision
or language) in isolation. This prevalent practice neglects the inherent
multimodality of LVLMs and the continuous nature of knowledge updates,
potentially leading to suboptimal editing outcomes when considering the
interplay between modalities and the need for ongoing knowledge refinement. To
address these limitations, we propose MemEIC, a novel method for Continual and
Compositional Knowledge Editing (CCKE) in LVLMs. MemEIC enables compositional
editing of both visual and textual knowledge sequentially. Our approach employs
a hybrid external-internal editor featuring a dual external memory for
cross-modal evidence retrieval and dual LoRA adapters that facilitate
disentangled parameter updates for each modality. A key component is a
brain-inspired knowledge connector, activated selectively for compositional
reasoning, that integrates information across different modalities. Experiments
demonstrate that MemEIC significantly improves performance on complex
multimodal questions and effectively preserves prior edits, setting a new
benchmark for CCKE in LVLMs.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了时间序列预测中的频谱偏差现象，提出了FreLE算法来缓解这一问题，通过显式和隐式频率正则化提升模型泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列数据的自相关性给多变量时间序列预测带来挑战。研究者发现神经网络存在频谱偏差现象（模型优先拟合低频信号），但这一现象常被归因于特定架构而非普遍特性。

Method: 通过大量实证实验测量主流模型的频谱偏差，提出FreLE算法，这是一种即插即用的模型损失函数单元，通过显式和隐式频率正则化来增强模型泛化。

Result: 实验证明几乎所有模型都存在频谱偏差现象，FreLE算法在大量实验中表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: 频谱偏差是时间序列预测模型的普遍特性，FreLE算法能有效缓解这一问题，提升预测性能。

Abstract: The inherent autocorrelation of time series data presents an ongoing
challenge to multivariate time series prediction. Recently, a widely adopted
approach has been the incorporation of frequency domain information to assist
in long-term prediction tasks. Many researchers have independently observed the
spectral bias phenomenon in neural networks, where models tend to fit
low-frequency signals before high-frequency ones. However, these observations
have often been attributed to the specific architectures designed by the
researchers, rather than recognizing the phenomenon as a universal
characteristic across models. To unify the understanding of the spectral bias
phenomenon in long-term time series prediction, we conducted extensive
empirical experiments to measure spectral bias in existing mainstream models.
Our findings reveal that virtually all models exhibit this phenomenon. To
mitigate the impact of spectral bias, we propose the FreLE (Frequency Loss
Enhancement) algorithm, which enhances model generalization through both
explicit and implicit frequency regularization. This is a plug-and-play model
loss function unit. A large number of experiments have proven the superior
performance of FreLE. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出SPECS框架，通过自蒸馏生成偏好数据对，使用偏好训练方法替代传统的SFT冷启动，在多个多模态基准测试中取得显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SFT冷启动方法将推理范式与任务解决方案和输出格式交织在一起，可能导致指令风格过拟合，削弱分布外泛化能力，并影响下游强化学习。

Method: SPECS框架：1）通过自蒸馏生成内省偏好数据对；2）执行基于偏好的训练，专注于浅层、可转移的表面形式标准；3）将验证奖励交给RL进行深度推理。

Result: 在多个多模态基准测试中，MEGA-Bench提升4.1%，MathVista提升12.2%，同时减少分布内"卡顿"、改善探索、稳定训练并提高性能上限。

Conclusion: 基于偏好的冷启动方法比SFT方法具有更好的泛化能力，解耦学习框架能带来一致的性能提升。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards has recently catalyzed a
wave of "MLLM-r1" approaches that bring RL to vision language models. Most
representative paradigms begin with a cold start, typically employing
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), to initialize the policy before RL. However,
SFT-based cold start adopts the reasoning paradigm intertwined with task
solution and output format, which may induce instruction-style overfitting,
weakens out-of-distribution generalization, and ultimately affects downstream
RL. We revisit the cold start along two views, its training method and data
construction, and introduce the Generalization Factor (GF) coefficient to
quantify the generalization capability under different methods. Our empirical
study finds that preference-based training methods (e.g. DPO) generalizes
better than SFT-based methods in cold start. Motivated by this, we propose
SPECS-a Self-distilled, Preference-based Cold Start framework that decouples
multimodal learning: (1) generates introspective preference data pairs via
self-distillation, avoiding reliance on larger teachers or manual annotation;
(2) performs preference-based training to learn, focusing on shallow,
transferable surface-form criteria (format, structure, style) rather than
memorizing content; and (3) hands off to RL with verifiable rewards for deep
reasoning results. Experimental results across multiple multimodal benchmarks
show that our decoupling learning framework yields consistent performance gains
over strong baselines, improving MEGA-Bench by 4.1% and MathVista by 12.2%.
Additional experiments indicate that SPECS contributes to reducing
in-distribution "stuckness," improving exploration, stabilizing training, and
raising the performance ceiling.

TL;DR: 提出MoE-POT模型，一种稀疏激活的专家混合架构，通过动态选择专家网络来高效扩展参数并控制推理成本，在PDE求解任务中显著降低零样本误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决PDE数据集的异质性导致的混合训练高误差问题，以及密集预训练模型推理成本高的问题。

Method: 采用分层路由门控网络，在推理时从16个专家网络中动态选择4个路由专家，同时集成2个共享专家来捕获PDE的共性特征，最终输出为所有激活专家结果的加权平均。

Result: 在6个公共PDE数据集上预训练30M到0.5B参数的模型，90M激活参数的模型相比现有120M激活参数模型零样本误差降低高达40%。

Conclusion: MoE架构在PDE求解中具有合理性和有效性，路由门控网络决策可推断数据集类型，验证了模型设计的有效性。

Abstract: Pre-training has proven effective in addressing data scarcity and performance
limitations in solving PDE problems with neural operators. However, challenges
remain due to the heterogeneity of PDE datasets in equation types, which leads
to high errors in mixed training. Additionally, dense pre-training models that
scale parameters by increasing network width or depth incur significant
inference costs. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel
Mixture-of-Experts Pre-training Operator Transformer (MoE-POT), a
sparse-activated architecture that scales parameters efficiently while
controlling inference costs. Specifically, our model adopts a layer-wise
router-gating network to dynamically select 4 routed experts from 16 expert
networks during inference, enabling the model to focus on equation-specific
features. Meanwhile, we also integrate 2 shared experts, aiming to capture
common properties of PDE and reduce redundancy among routed experts. The final
output is computed as the weighted average of the results from all activated
experts. We pre-train models with parameters from 30M to 0.5B on 6 public PDE
datasets. Our model with 90M activated parameters achieves up to a 40%
reduction in zero-shot error compared with existing models with 120M activated
parameters. Additionally, we conduct interpretability analysis, showing that
dataset types can be inferred from router-gating network decisions, which
validates the rationality and effectiveness of the MoE architecture.

TL;DR: PRESTO是一个利用软提示原像结构进行高效指令优化的新框架，通过分数共享、原像初始化和分数一致性正则化，在相同查询预算下获得14倍评分数据，显著提升优化效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 黑盒大语言模型指令优化中，白盒LLM常将不同软提示映射到相同指令，导致查询冗余。传统方法将此视为阻碍，本文重新解读为可加速优化的先验知识。

Method: PRESTO框架包含三个核心组件：分数共享（与原像内所有软提示共享评分）、原像初始化（利用原像信息最大化搜索空间覆盖）、分数一致性正则化（强制原像内预测一致性）。

Result: 在33个指令优化任务上的实验结果表明，PRESTO通过利用原像结构，在相同查询预算下有效获得14倍评分数据，实现更高效的优化。

Conclusion: PRESTO成功证明了软提示到指令的多对一映射结构可作为有用先验知识，显著加速黑盒LLM的指令优化过程，为高效指令优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
domains, due to their strong instruction-following capabilities. This has led
to increasing interest in optimizing instructions for black-box LLMs, whose
internal parameters are inaccessible but widely used due to their strong
performance. To optimize instructions for black-box LLMs, recent methods employ
white-box LLMs to generate candidate instructions from optimized soft prompts.
However, white-box LLMs often map different soft prompts to the same
instruction, leading to redundant queries. While previous studies regarded this
many-to-one mapping as a structure that hinders optimization efficiency, we
reinterpret it as a useful prior knowledge that can accelerate the
optimization. To this end, we introduce PREimage-informed inSTruction
Optimization (PRESTO), a novel framework that leverages the preimage structure
of soft prompts for efficient optimization. PRESTO consists of three key
components: (1) score sharing, which shares the evaluation score with all soft
prompts in a preimage; (2) preimage-based initialization, which selects initial
data points that maximize search space coverage using preimage information; and
(3) score consistency regularization, which enforces prediction consistency
within each preimage. By leveraging preimages, PRESTO achieves the effect of
effectively obtaining 14 times more scored data under the same query budget,
resulting in more efficient optimization. Experimental results on 33
instruction optimization tasks demonstrate the superior performance of PRESTO.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型在生成超出训练分辨率的图像时性能下降，现有无需训练的方法计算量大或与Diffusion Transformer模型不兼容。

Method: 提出Neighborhood Patch Attention减少自注意力层计算冗余，结合SDEdit流程和Latent Frequency Mixing生成细节，使用Structure Guidance增强全局结构。

Result: 在U-Net和Diffusion Transformer架构上，ScaleDiff在图像质量和推理速度方面均达到无需训练方法的最先进性能。

Conclusion: ScaleDiff是一个模型无关的高效框架，无需额外训练即可扩展预训练扩散模型的分辨率，在计算效率和图像质量方面表现优异。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models often exhibit degraded performance when
generating images beyond their training resolution. Recent training-free
methods can mitigate this limitation, but they often require substantial
computation or are incompatible with recent Diffusion Transformer models. In
this paper, we propose ScaleDiff, a model-agnostic and highly efficient
framework for extending the resolution of pretrained diffusion models without
any additional training. A core component of our framework is Neighborhood
Patch Attention (NPA), an efficient mechanism that reduces computational
redundancy in the self-attention layer with non-overlapping patches. We
integrate NPA into an SDEdit pipeline and introduce Latent Frequency Mixing
(LFM) to better generate fine details. Furthermore, we apply Structure Guidance
to enhance global structure during the denoising process. Experimental results
demonstrate that ScaleDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance among
training-free methods in terms of both image quality and inference speed on
both U-Net and Diffusion Transformer architectures.

TL;DR: MedVLSynther是一个基于规则指导的生成-验证框架，能够从开放生物医学文献中合成高质量的多选题VQA项目，解决了医疗VQA系统训练数据缺乏的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练通用医疗VQA系统受到缺乏大型、开放可用、高质量语料库的限制，需要解决医疗视觉问答数据稀缺的问题。

Method: 采用生成器-验证器框架，生成器根据图像、标题和文本引用生成自包含的问题主干和互斥选项，多阶段验证器强制执行关键标准（自包含性、单一正确答案、临床有效性、图像-文本一致性）。

Result: 从PubMed Central生成MedSynVQA数据集：13,087个审核问题，覆盖14,803张图像、13种成像模式和28个解剖区域。训练的开源LMM在六个医疗VQA基准测试中表现优异，平均准确率达55.85（3B）和58.15（7B）。

Conclusion: MedVLSynther提供了一个可审计、可复现且保护隐私的路径，用于扩展医疗VQA训练数据，完全基于开放文献和开源模型运行。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are increasingly capable of answering medical
questions that require joint reasoning over images and text, yet training
general medical VQA systems is impeded by the lack of large, openly usable,
high-quality corpora. We present MedVLSynther, a rubric-guided
generator-verifier framework that synthesizes high-quality multiple-choice VQA
items directly from open biomedical literature by conditioning on figures,
captions, and in-text references. The generator produces self-contained stems
and parallel, mutually exclusive options under a machine-checkable JSON schema;
a multi-stage verifier enforces essential gates (self-containment, single
correct answer, clinical validity, image-text consistency), awards fine-grained
positive points, and penalizes common failure modes before acceptance. Applying
this pipeline to PubMed Central yields MedSynVQA: 13,087 audited questions over
14,803 images spanning 13 imaging modalities and 28 anatomical regions.
Training open-weight LMMs with reinforcement learning using verifiable rewards
improves accuracy across six medical VQA benchmarks, achieving averages of
55.85 (3B) and 58.15 (7B), with up to 77.57 on VQA-RAD and 67.76 on PathVQA,
outperforming strong medical LMMs. A Ablations verify that both generation and
verification are necessary and that more verified data consistently helps, and
a targeted contamination analysis detects no leakage from evaluation suites. By
operating entirely on open literature and open-weight models, MedVLSynther
offers an auditable, reproducible, and privacy-preserving path to scalable
medical VQA training data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于流的VLA模型在强化学习中面临动作对数似然计算困难的问题，这阻碍了大规模RL的应用。需要开发新方法来克服这一挑战。

Method: π_RL框架实现两种RL算法：Flow-Noise将去噪过程建模为离散时间MDP，使用可学习的噪声网络进行精确对数似然计算；Flow-SDE将去噪与智能体-环境交互集成，采用ODE到SDE转换实现高效RL探索。

Result: 在LIBERO基准上，π_RL将π_0和π_0.5模型的性能分别从57.6%提升到97.6%和从77.1%提升到98.3%。在ManiSkill基准上，在320个并行环境中训练，将π_0和π_0.5在4352个拾放任务中的性能分别从41.6%提升到85.7%和从40.0%提升到84.8%。

Conclusion: π_RL框架实现了显著的性能提升和更强的泛化能力，验证了在线强化学习对于基于流的VLA模型的有效性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models enable robots to understand and perform
complex tasks from multimodal input. Although recent work explores using
reinforcement learning (RL) to automate the laborious data collection process
in scaling supervised fine-tuning (SFT), applying large-scale RL to flow-based
VLAs (e.g., $\pi_0$, $\pi_{0.5}$) remains challenging due to intractable action
log-likelihoods from iterative denoising.
  We address this challenge with $\pi_{\text{RL}}$, an open-source framework
for training flow-based VLAs in parallel simulation. $\pi_{\text{RL}}$
implements two RL algorithms: (1) {Flow-Noise} models the denoising process as
a discrete-time MDP with a learnable noise network for exact log-likelihood
computation. (2) {Flow-SDE} integrates denoising with agent-environment
interaction, formulating a two-layer MDP that employs ODE-to-SDE conversion for
efficient RL exploration.
  We evaluate $\pi_{\text{RL}}$ on LIBERO and ManiSkill benchmarks. On LIBERO,
$\pi_{\text{RL}}$ boosts few-shot SFT models $\pi_0$ and $\pi_{0.5}$ from 57.6%
to 97.6% and from 77.1% to 98.3%, respectively. In ManiSkill, we train
$\pi_{\text{RL}}$ in 320 parallel environments, improving $\pi_0$ from 41.6% to
85.7% and $\pi_{0.5}$ from 40.0% to 84.8% across 4352 pick-and-place tasks,
demonstrating scalable multitask RL under heterogeneous simulation.
  Overall, $\pi_{\text{RL}}$ achieves significant performance gains and
stronger generalization over SFT-models, validating the effectiveness of online
RL for flow-based VLAs.

Abstract: We propose a graph-topological approach to active learning that directly
targets the core challenge of exploration versus exploitation under scarce
label budgets. To guide exploration, we introduce a coreset construction
algorithm based on Balanced Forman Curvature (BFC), which selects
representative initial labels that reflect the graph's cluster structure. This
method includes a data-driven stopping criterion that signals when the graph
has been sufficiently explored. We further use BFC to dynamically trigger the
shift from exploration to exploitation within active learning routines,
replacing hand-tuned heuristics. To improve exploitation, we introduce a
localized graph rewiring strategy that efficiently incorporates multiscale
information around labeled nodes, enhancing label propagation while preserving
sparsity. Experiments on benchmark classification tasks show that our methods
consistently outperform existing graph-based semi-supervised baselines at low
label rates.

confounder and can change between the different domains. We assume that we have
access to a proxy of the hidden confounder and that all variables are discrete

target domain, where we assume to observe only the proxy variable. Under these
conditions, we prove identifiability (even when treatment and response
variables are continuous). We introduce two estimation techniques, prove
consistency, and derive confidence intervals. The theoretical results are
supported by simulation studies and a real-world example studying the causal
effect of website rankings on consumer choices.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的主动学习方法在处理混乱、未整理的数据池时效果有限，因为它们依赖固定的无监督表示，无法捕捉与目标任务相关的信息。

Result: 两种策略都显著优于使用无监督或预训练表示的方法，在实证性能上有明显提升。

Conclusion: 在主动学习过程中定期更新任务驱动的表示是处理混乱数据池的有效方法。

Abstract: Active learning has the potential to be especially useful for messy,
uncurated pools where datapoints vary in relevance to the target task. However,
state-of-the-art approaches to this problem currently rely on using fixed,
unsupervised representations of the pool, focusing on modifying the acquisition
function instead. We show that this model setup can undermine their
effectiveness at dealing with messy pools, as such representations can fail to
capture important information relevant to the task. To address this, we propose
using task-driven representations that are periodically updated during the
active learning process using the previously collected labels. We introduce two
specific strategies for learning these representations, one based on directly
learning semi-supervised representations and the other based on supervised
fine-tuning of an initial unsupervised representation. We find that both
significantly improve empirical performance over using unsupervised or
pretrained representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN水印方法依赖后门触发器，容易受到常见模型编辑的影响并产生所有权模糊问题，需要一种更鲁棒的水印方案。

Method: 使用轻量级头部预测所有者私有载体集上的归一化代数连通性，通过符号敏感解码器输出比特，并采用校准阈值控制误报率。

Result: 在多种节点和图分类数据集及骨干网络上，InvGNN-WM保持原始准确率的同时，水印准确率高于基于触发器和压缩的基线方法，对剪枝、微调和量化保持鲁棒。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了不可感知性和鲁棒性保证，证明了精确移除是NP完全问题，为GNN知识产权保护提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are valuable intellectual property, yet many
watermarks rely on backdoor triggers that break under common model edits and
create ownership ambiguity. We present InvGNN-WM, which ties ownership to a
model's implicit perception of a graph invariant, enabling trigger-free,
black-box verification with negligible task impact. A lightweight head predicts
normalized algebraic connectivity on an owner-private carrier set; a
sign-sensitive decoder outputs bits, and a calibrated threshold controls the
false-positive rate. Across diverse node and graph classification datasets and
backbones, InvGNN-WM matches clean accuracy while yielding higher watermark
accuracy than trigger- and compression-based baselines. It remains strong under
unstructured pruning, fine-tuning, and post-training quantization; plain
knowledge distillation (KD) weakens the mark, while KD with a watermark loss
(KD+WM) restores it. We provide guarantees for imperceptibility and robustness,

*Tcharlies Schmitz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MLT是一种可逆的确定性技术，用于将高基数分类标识符编码为紧凑数值向量，通过模运算和可逆线性变换保持双射映射，具有维度控制和计算可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统哈希或独热编码方法无法保持双射映射，MLT旨在提供一种可逆且确定性的编码方案来处理高基数分类数据。

Method: 利用有限域上的模运算和可逆线性变换，实现标识符到数值向量的双射编码，支持维度显式控制和计算可扩展性。

Result: 在MovieLens 20M数据集上的实验表明，MLT在预测性能上与监督嵌入相当，但参数更少、训练成本更低。

Conclusion: MLT提供了一种高效可逆的分类标识符编码方法，在保持性能的同时显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: This paper introduces Modular Linear Tokenization (MLT), a reversible and
deterministic technique for encoding high-cardinality categorical identifiers
into compact numerical vectors. Unlike traditional hashing or one-hot
encodings, MLT preserves bijective mappings by leveraging modular arithmetic
over finite fields and invertible linear transformations. The method offers
explicit control of dimensionality and computational scalability while
maintaining full reversibility, even for millions of identifiers. Experimental
results on the MovieLens 20M dataset show that MLT achieves comparable
predictive performance to supervised embeddings while requiring significantly
fewer parameters and lower training cost. An open-source implementation of MLT
is available on PyPI (https://pypi.org/project/light-mlt/) and GitHub
(https://github.com/tcharliesschmitz/light-mlt).

TL;DR: 该研究评估了三种地理基础模型嵌入源在马拉维预测15项常规健康项目指标的表现，发现多源GeoFM模型在87%的指标上优于传统地理统计方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低收入和中等收入国家的常规健康数据存在报告延迟和覆盖不全的问题，需要探索新的数据源和分析方法来提高数据可靠性。

Method: 使用XGBoost模型，基于552个健康服务区的数据（2021年1月-2023年5月），比较三种GeoFM嵌入源（Google人口动态基础模型、Google AlphaEarth卫星影像、移动电话详单记录）与传统地理插值方法，采用80/20训练测试分割和5折交叉验证。

Result: 基于嵌入的方法在15个指标中的13个（87%）优于基线地理统计方法。多源GeoFM模型表现最稳健，在人口密度、新HIV病例和儿童疫苗接种等指标上取得较好预测效果（R2分别为0.63、0.57、0.47），但对结核病和营养不良等数据稀缺目标的预测效果较差。

Conclusion: GeoFM嵌入为LMIC环境中的特定健康和人口结果提供了适度的预测改进，多源GeoFM整合是补充和加强受限常规健康信息系统的有效且有价值的工具。

Abstract: The reliability of routine health data in low and middle-income countries
(LMICs) is often constrained by reporting delays and incomplete coverage,
necessitating the exploration of novel data sources and analytics. Geospatial
Foundation Models (GeoFMs) offer a promising avenue by synthesizing diverse
spatial, temporal, and behavioral data into mathematical embeddings that can be
efficiently used for downstream prediction tasks. This study evaluated the
predictive performance of three GeoFM embedding sources - Google Population
Dynamics Foundation Model (PDFM), Google AlphaEarth (derived from satellite
imagery), and mobile phone call detail records (CDR) - for modeling 15 routine
health programmatic outputs in Malawi, and compared their utility to
traditional geospatial interpolation methods. We used XGBoost models on data
from 552 health catchment areas (January 2021-May 2023), assessing performance
with R2, and using an 80/20 training and test data split with 5-fold
cross-validation used in training. While predictive performance was mixed, the
embedding-based approaches improved upon baseline geostatistical methods in 13
of 15 (87%) indicators tested. A Multi-GeoFM model integrating all three
embedding sources produced the most robust predictions, achieving average
5-fold cross validated R2 values for indicators like population density (0.63),
new HIV cases (0.57), and child vaccinations (0.47) and test set R2 of 0.64,
0.68, and 0.55, respectively. Prediction was poor for prediction targets with
low primary data availability, such as TB and malnutrition cases. These results
demonstrate that GeoFM embeddings imbue a modest predictive improvement for
select health and demographic outcomes in an LMIC context. We conclude that the
integration of multiple GeoFM sources is an efficient and valuable tool for
supplementing and strengthening constrained routine health information systems.

<details>

Motivation: 该设置的动机源于两个关键因素：(i) 数据驱动的学习方法在组合优化等领域尚未展现出强劲结果；(ii) 训练数据可用性有限，如医学图像重建等科学应用。

Method: 定义了无数据设置并将其分为两种变体：架构无关方法和架构特定方法，基于单个数据点如何编码到神经网络上。

Conclusion: 讨论了无数据神经网络设置与零样本学习、单样本学习、优化中的提升和过参数化等相关概念的相似性和区别。

Abstract: This paper surveys studies on the use of neural networks for optimization in
the training-data-free setting. Specifically, we examine the dataless
application of neural network architectures in optimization by
re-parameterizing problems using fully connected (or MLP), convolutional,
graph, and quadratic neural networks. Although MLPs have been used to solve
linear programs a few decades ago, this approach has recently gained increasing
attention due to its promising results across diverse applications, including
those based on combinatorial optimization, inverse problems, and partial
differential equations. The motivation for this setting stems from two key
(possibly over-lapping) factors: (i) data-driven learning approaches are still
underdeveloped and have yet to demonstrate strong results, as seen in
combinatorial optimization, and (ii) the availability of training data is
inherently limited, such as in medical image reconstruction and other
scientific applications. In this paper, we define the dataless setting and
categorize it into two variants based on how a problem instance -- defined by a
single datum -- is encoded onto the neural network: (i) architecture-agnostic
methods and (ii) architecture-specific methods. Additionally, we discuss
similarities and clarify distinctions between the dataless neural network (dNN)
settings and related concepts such as zero-shot learning, one-shot learning,
lifting in optimization, and over-parameterization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: InfoNCE不是有效的互信息估计器，作者提出了InfoNCE-anchor改进方法，通过引入辅助锚点类实现更准确的互信息估计，但发现下游任务性能并未提升，表明对比表示学习受益于结构化密度比学习而非准确的互信息估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: InfoNCE目标函数虽然广泛用于互信息估计，但其与互信息的间接关联存在问题，需要开发更准确的互信息估计方法。

Method: 提出InfoNCE-anchor方法，引入辅助锚点类实现一致的密度比估计；使用适当评分规则推广框架，将NCE、InfoNCE和f-散度变体统一起来。

Result: InfoNCE-anchor在互信息估计上显著减少偏差，但在自监督表示学习中并未改善下游任务性能。

Conclusion: 对比表示学习的优势在于学习结构化密度比，而非准确的互信息估计本身。

Abstract: The InfoNCE objective, originally introduced for contrastive representation
learning, has become a popular choice for mutual information (MI) estimation,
despite its indirect connection to MI. In this paper, we demonstrate why
InfoNCE should not be regarded as a valid MI estimator, and we introduce a
simple modification, which we refer to as InfoNCE-anchor, for accurate MI
estimation. Our modification introduces an auxiliary anchor class, enabling
consistent density ratio estimation and yielding a plug-in MI estimator with
significantly reduced bias. Beyond this, we generalize our framework using
proper scoring rules, which recover InfoNCE-anchor as a special case when the
log score is employed. This formulation unifies a broad spectrum of contrastive
objectives, including NCE, InfoNCE, and $f$-divergence variants, under a single
principled framework. Empirically, we find that InfoNCE-anchor with the log
score achieves the most accurate MI estimates; however, in self-supervised
representation learning experiments, we find that the anchor does not improve
the downstream task performance. These findings corroborate that contrastive
representation learning benefits not from accurate MI estimation per se, but
from the learning of structured density ratios.

Conclusion: 可微分优化可以作为实验、学习、校准和设计的常规工具，无需偏离标准JuMP建模实践，同时保留广泛求解器生态系统的访问。

Abstract: Differentiating through constrained optimization problems is increasingly
central to learning, control, and large-scale decision-making systems, yet
practical integration remains challenging due to solver specialization and
interface mismatches. This paper presents a general and streamlined
framework-an updated DiffOpt.jl-that unifies modeling and differentiation
within the Julia optimization stack. The framework computes forward - and
reverse-mode solution and objective sensitivities for smooth, potentially
nonconvex programs by differentiating the KKT system under standard regularity
assumptions. A first-class, JuMP-native parameter-centric API allows users to
declare named parameters and obtain derivatives directly with respect to them -
even when a parameter appears in multiple constraints and objectives -
eliminating brittle bookkeeping from coefficient-level interfaces. We
illustrate these capabilities on convex and nonconvex models, including
economic dispatch, mean-variance portfolio selection with conic risk
constraints, and nonlinear robot inverse kinematics. Two companion studies
further demonstrate impact at scale: gradient-based iterative methods for
strategic bidding in energy markets and Sobolev-style training of end-to-end
optimization proxies using solver-accurate sensitivities. Together, these
results demonstrate that differentiable optimization can be deployed as a
routine tool for experimentation, learning, calibration, and design-without
deviating from standard JuMP modeling practices and while retaining access to a
broad ecosystem of solvers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统反向传播在生物合理性方面存在不足，预测编码框架虽然具有生物合理性但计算开销大，需要解决边缘机器人系统实时适应的高效学习需求。

Method: 提出预测编码网络时间摊销(PCN-TA)，通过跨时间帧保留潜在状态，利用时间相关性减少计算需求。

Result: 在COIL-20机器人感知数据集上，PCN-TA比反向传播减少10%权重更新，比基线PC网络减少50%推理步骤。

Conclusion: PCN-TA在保持生物合理性的同时显著提升计算效率，为边缘部署和实时适应提供了可行方案，是未来神经形态硬件实现的有前景候选方法。

Abstract: Robotic systems operating at the edge require efficient online learning
algorithms that can continuously adapt to changing environments while
processing streaming sensory data. Traditional backpropagation, while
effective, conflicts with biological plausibility principles and may be
suboptimal for continuous adaptation scenarios. The Predictive Coding (PC)
framework offers a biologically plausible alternative with local, Hebbian-like
update rules, making it suitable for neuromorphic hardware implementation.
However, PC's main limitation is its computational overhead due to multiple
inference iterations during training. We present Predictive Coding Network with
Temporal Amortization (PCN-TA), which preserves latent states across temporal
frames. By leveraging temporal correlations, PCN-TA significantly reduces
computational demands while maintaining learning performance. Our experiments
on the COIL-20 robotic perception dataset demonstrate that PCN-TA achieves 10%
fewer weight updates compared to backpropagation and requires 50% fewer
inference steps than baseline PC networks. These efficiency gains directly
translate to reduced computational overhead for moving another step toward edge
deployment and real-time adaptation support in resource-constrained robotic
systems. The biologically-inspired nature of our approach also makes it a
promising candidate for future neuromorphic hardware implementations, enabling
efficient online learning at the edge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决线性赌博机中完全自适应探索方法（如UCB、Thompson Sampling）需要频繁探索与纯贪婪方法需要严格多样性假设之间的矛盾，适用于安全关键或成本高昂的领域。

Method: INFEX框架：按照预定调度执行基础探索策略，在探索间隔期间主要选择贪婪动作，是一个模块化通用框架。

Result: 理论分析表明，只要探索频率超过对数阈值，INFEX就能达到与标准高效算法相当的实例依赖遗憾；实证评估显示在遗憾性能和运行时间上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: INFEX是一个简单实用的稀疏探索框架，既能保证理论性能，又能提高计算效率，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: We study the problem of infrequent exploration in linear bandits, addressing
a significant yet overlooked gap between fully adaptive exploratory methods
(e.g., UCB and Thompson Sampling), which explore potentially at every time
step, and purely greedy approaches, which require stringent diversity
assumptions to succeed. Continuous exploration can be impractical or unethical
in safety-critical or costly domains, while purely greedy strategies typically
fail without adequate contextual diversity. To bridge these extremes, we
introduce a simple and practical framework, INFEX, explicitly designed for
infrequent exploration. INFEX executes a base exploratory policy according to a
given schedule while predominantly choosing greedy actions in between. Despite
its simplicity, our theoretical analysis demonstrates that INFEX achieves
instance-dependent regret matching standard provably efficient algorithms,
provided the exploration frequency exceeds a logarithmic threshold.
Additionally, INFEX is a general, modular framework that allows seamless
integration of any fully adaptive exploration method, enabling wide
applicability and ease of adoption. By restricting intensive exploratory
computations to infrequent intervals, our approach can also enhance
computational efficiency. Empirical evaluations confirm our theoretical
findings, showing state-of-the-art regret performance and runtime improvements
over existing methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于离散时间生存分析的双重专家混合框架，结合特征编码器MoE和风险MoE，在乳腺癌数据集上显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生存分析需要同时建模患者异质性、个体特征和时间动态，现有方法难以灵活整合这些要素。

Method: 使用双重MoE框架：特征编码器MoE用于亚组感知表示学习，风险MoE利用患者特征和时间嵌入来捕捉时间动态。

Result: 在METABRIC和GBSG乳腺癌数据集上，时间依赖性C指数在测试集上提升高达0.04，与Consurv框架结合时获得进一步增益。

Conclusion: 双重MoE框架能有效提升生存分析性能，灵活整合现有深度学习生存分析流程。

Abstract: Survival analysis is a task to model the time until an event of interest
occurs, widely used in clinical and biomedical research. A key challenge is to
model patient heterogeneity while also adapting risk predictions to both
individual characteristics and temporal dynamics. We propose a dual
mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework for discrete-time survival analysis. Our
approach combines a feature-encoder MoE for subgroup-aware representation
learning with a hazard MoE that leverages patient features and time embeddings
to capture temporal dynamics. This dual-MoE design flexibly integrates with
existing deep learning based survival pipelines. On METABRIC and GBSG breast
cancer datasets, our method consistently improves performance, boosting the
time-dependent C-index up to 0.04 on the test sets, and yields further gains
when incorporated into the Consurv framework.

Motivation: 探究AI系统是真正理解人类概念还是仅仅模仿表面模式，特别是在象棋这种需要精确战略概念的领域

Method: 分析270M参数的transformer模型，引入首个Chess960数据集（240个专家标注位置，涵盖6个战略概念），通过随机起始位置消除开局理论影响

Result: 早期层能准确编码人类概念（85%准确率），但深层层准确率降至50-65%；当消除开局理论时，概念识别率下降10-20%，显示模型依赖记忆模式而非抽象理解

Conclusion: 当前架构存在根本性张力：赢得游戏的表征与人类思维表征相背离，AI系统在优化性能时会发展出越来越"异化"的智能，这对需要真正人机协作的创造性AI应用构成挑战

Abstract: Do AI systems truly understand human concepts or merely mimic surface
patterns? We investigate this through chess, where human creativity meets
precise strategic concepts. Analyzing a 270M-parameter transformer that
achieves grandmaster-level play, we uncover a striking paradox: while early
layers encode human concepts like center control and knight outposts with up to
85\% accuracy, deeper layers, despite driving superior performance, drift
toward alien representations, dropping to 50-65\% accuracy. To test conceptual
robustness beyond memorization, we introduce the first Chess960 dataset: 240
expert-annotated positions across 6 strategic concepts. When opening theory is
eliminated through randomized starting positions, concept recognition drops
10-20\% across all methods, revealing the model's reliance on memorized
patterns rather than abstract understanding. Our layer-wise analysis exposes a
fundamental tension in current architectures: the representations that win
games diverge from those that align with human thinking. These findings suggest
that as AI systems optimize for performance, they develop increasingly alien
intelligence, a critical challenge for creative AI applications requiring
genuine human-AI collaboration. Dataset and code are available at:

Conclusion: 提出了三种改进去偏方法可蒸馏性的解决方案：开发高质量增强数据、实施迭代知识蒸馏、用教师模型权重初始化学生模型。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective method for model compression and
transferring knowledge between models. However, its effect on model's
robustness against spurious correlations that degrade performance on
out-of-distribution data remains underexplored. This study investigates the
effect of knowledge distillation on the transferability of ``debiasing''
capabilities from teacher models to student models on natural language
inference (NLI) and image classification tasks. Through extensive experiments,
we illustrate several key findings: (i) overall the debiasing capability of a
model is undermined post-KD; (ii) training a debiased model does not benefit
from injecting teacher knowledge; (iii) although the overall robustness of a
model may remain stable post-distillation, significant variations can occur
across different types of biases; and (iv) we pin-point the internal attention
pattern and circuit that causes the distinct behavior post-KD. Given the above
findings, we propose three effective solutions to improve the distillability of
debiasing methods: developing high quality data for augmentation, implementing
iterative knowledge distillation, and initializing student models with weights
obtained from teacher models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
study on the effect of KD on debiasing and its interenal mechanism at scale.
Our findings provide understandings on how KD works and how to design better
debiasing methods.

Conclusion: 符号回归性能在很大程度上可以从计算量预测，这为训练下一代符号回归模型提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) aims to discover the underlying mathematical
expressions that explain observed data. This holds promise for both gaining
scientific insight and for producing inherently interpretable and generalizable
models for tabular data. In this work we focus on the basics of SR. Deep
learning-based SR has recently become competitive with genetic programming
approaches, but the role of scale has remained largely unexplored. Inspired by
scaling laws in language modeling, we present the first systematic
investigation of scaling in SR, using a scalable end-to-end transformer
pipeline and carefully generated training data. Across five different model
sizes and spanning three orders of magnitude in compute, we find that both
validation loss and solved rate follow clear power-law trends with compute. We
further identify compute-optimal hyperparameter scaling: optimal batch size and
learning rate grow with model size, and a token-to-parameter ratio of
$\approx$15 is optimal in our regime, with a slight upward trend as compute
increases. These results demonstrate that SR performance is largely predictable
from compute and offer important insights for training the next generation of
SR models.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel paradigm for machine learning that moves beyond
traditional parameter optimization. Unlike conventional approaches that search
for optimal parameters within a fixed geometric space, our core idea is to
treat the model itself as a malleable geometric entity. Specifically, we
optimize the metric tensor field on a manifold with a predefined topology,
thereby dynamically shaping the geometric structure of the model space. To
achieve this, we construct a variational framework whose loss function
carefully balances data fidelity against the intrinsic geometric complexity of
the manifold. The former ensures the model effectively explains observed data,
while the latter acts as a regularizer, penalizing overly curved or irregular
geometries to encourage simpler models and prevent overfitting. To address the
computational challenges of this infinite-dimensional optimization problem, we
introduce a practical method based on discrete differential geometry: the
continuous manifold is discretized into a triangular mesh, and the metric
tensor is parameterized by edge lengths, enabling efficient optimization using
automatic differentiation tools. Theoretical analysis reveals a profound
analogy between our framework and the Einstein-Hilbert action in general
relativity, providing an elegant physical interpretation for the concept of
"data-driven geometry". We further argue that even with fixed topology, metric
optimization offers significantly greater expressive power than models with
fixed geometry. This work lays a solid foundation for constructing fully
dynamic "meta-learners" capable of autonomously evolving their geometry and
topology, and it points to broad application prospects in areas such as
scientific model discovery and robust representation learning.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising approach to address the
challenges of using sensitive financial data in machine learning applications.
By leveraging generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), it is possible to create artificial
datasets that preserve the statistical properties of real financial records
while mitigating privacy risks and regulatory constraints. Despite the rapid
growth of this field, a comprehensive synthesis of the current research
landscape has been lacking. This systematic review consolidates and analyses 72
studies published since 2018 that focus on synthetic financial data generation.
We categorise the types of financial information synthesised, the generative
methods employed, and the evaluation strategies used to assess data utility and
privacy. The findings indicate that GAN-based approaches dominate the
literature, particularly for generating time-series market data and tabular
credit data. While several innovative techniques demonstrate potential for
improved realism and privacy preservation, there remains a notable lack of
rigorous evaluation of privacy safeguards across studies. By providing an
integrated overview of generative techniques, applications, and evaluation
methods, this review highlights critical research gaps and offers guidance for
future work aimed at developing robust, privacy-preserving synthetic data
solutions for the financial domain.

Result: 在自然语言建模基准测试中，Nirvana取得了与现有LLM结构相当或更优的结果。在医学MRI任务上，尽管Nirvana主干网络是冻结的，但Trigger引导模型适应MRI领域，实现了比传统MRI模型和传统LLM主干模型更高质量的MRI重建，并能生成准确的初步临床报告。

Conclusion: Nirvana通过专门的记忆机制和任务感知适应能力，成功实现了在保持通用能力的同时在特定领域达到专家级性能的目标，证明了专门记忆机制在专业化通用模型中的有效性。

Abstract: Specialized Generalist Models (SGMs) aim to preserve broad capabilities while
achieving expert-level performance in target domains. However, traditional LLM
structures including Transformer, Linear Attention, and hybrid models do not
employ specialized memory mechanism guided by task information. In this paper,
we present Nirvana, an SGM with specialized memory mechanism, linear time
complexity, and test-time task information extraction. Besides, we propose the
Task-Aware Memory Trigger ($\textit{Trigger}$) that flexibly adjusts memory
mechanism based on the current task's requirements. In Trigger, each incoming
sample is treated as a self-supervised fine-tuning task, enabling Nirvana to
adapt its task-related parameters on the fly to domain shifts. We also design
the Specialized Memory Updater ($\textit{Updater}$) that dynamically memorizes
the context guided by Trigger. We conduct experiments on both general language
tasks and specialized medical tasks. On a variety of natural language modeling
benchmarks, Nirvana achieves competitive or superior results compared to the
existing LLM structures. To prove the effectiveness of Trigger on specialized
tasks, we test Nirvana's performance on a challenging medical task, i.e.,
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). We post-train frozen Nirvana backbone with
lightweight codecs on paired electromagnetic signals and MRI images. Despite
the frozen Nirvana backbone, Trigger guides the model to adapt to the MRI
domain with the change of task-related parameters. Nirvana achieves
higher-quality MRI reconstruction compared to conventional MRI models as well
as the models with traditional LLMs' backbone, and can also generate accurate
preliminary clinical reports accordingly.

### [161] [LLMBisect: Breaking Barriers in Bug Bisection with A Comparative Analysis Pipeline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26086)
*Zheng Zhang,Haonan Li,Xingyu Li,Hang Zhang,Zhiyun Qian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大型语言模型的多阶段bug二分法方法，相比传统基于补丁的方法准确率提升超过38%，通过充分利用补丁信息、多候选提交对比和渐进式筛选来识别bug引入提交。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于补丁的bug二分法存在多个限制：假设bug引入提交和补丁提交修改相同函数、仅依赖代码变更而忽略提交消息中的漏洞信息、基于简单启发式方法缺乏逻辑分析。

Method: 设计了一个全面的多阶段流水线，利用LLMs：(1)充分利用补丁信息，(2)在上下文中比较多个候选提交，(3)通过一系列筛选步骤逐步缩小候选范围。

Result: 评估显示该方法比最先进解决方案的准确率提高了38%以上，多阶段流水线相比基线LLM二分法准确率提高了60%。

Conclusion: LLMs能够突破现有解决方案的障碍，理解补丁和提交中的文本数据和代码，多阶段流水线对于准确识别bug引入提交至关重要。

Abstract: Bug bisection has been an important security task that aims to understand the
range of software versions impacted by a bug, i.e., identifying the commit that
introduced the bug. However, traditional patch-based bisection methods are
faced with several significant barriers: For example, they assume that the
bug-inducing commit (BIC) and the patch commit modify the same functions, which
is not always true. They often rely solely on code changes, while the commit
message frequently contains a wealth of vulnerability-related information. They
are also based on simple heuristics (e.g., assuming the BIC initializes lines
deleted in the patch) and lack any logical analysis of the vulnerability.
  In this paper, we make the observation that Large Language Models (LLMs) are
well-positioned to break the barriers of existing solutions, e.g., comprehend
both textual data and code in patches and commits. Unlike previous BIC
identification approaches, which yield poor results, we propose a comprehensive
multi-stage pipeline that leverages LLMs to: (1) fully utilize patch
information, (2) compare multiple candidate commits in context, and (3)
progressively narrow down the candidates through a series of down-selection
steps. In our evaluation, we demonstrate that our approach achieves
significantly better accuracy than the state-of-the-art solution by more than
38\%. Our results further confirm that the comprehensive multi-stage pipeline
is essential, as it improves accuracy by 60\% over a baseline LLM-based
bisection method.

*Fazel Arasteh,Arian Haghparast,Manos Papagelis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了两种基于多智能体强化学习的动态车辆路由方法：AN（自适应导航）和HHAN（分层枢纽自适应导航），在动态多车辆环境中显著优于传统最短路径算法，减少拥堵和旅行时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统最短路径算法在动态多车辆环境中表现不佳，会导致所有车辆选择相同路径而加剧拥堵。需要开发能够协调多车辆、考虑网络状态的智能路由方法。

Method: AN使用分散式MARL，每个交叉口智能体基于局部交通和GAT建模的邻域状态提供路由指导。HHAN扩展AN，只在关键枢纽部署智能体，采用集中训练分散执行和注意力Q混合框架协调枢纽间路由。

Result: 在合成网格和真实城市地图上的实验显示，AN相比SPF和学习基线减少了平均旅行时间，保持100%路由成功率。HHAN可扩展到数百个交叉口的网络，在重交通下实现15.9%的改进。

Conclusion: 网络约束的MARL方法在智能交通系统中具有实现可扩展、协调和拥堵感知路由的潜力。

Abstract: Traffic congestion in urban road networks leads to longer trip times and
higher emissions, especially during peak periods. While the Shortest Path First
(SPF) algorithm is optimal for a single vehicle in a static network, it
performs poorly in dynamic, multi-vehicle settings, often worsening congestion
by routing all vehicles along identical paths. We address dynamic vehicle
routing through a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for
coordinated, network-aware fleet navigation. We first propose Adaptive
Navigation (AN), a decentralized MARL model where each intersection agent
provides routing guidance based on (i) local traffic and (ii) neighborhood
state modeled using Graph Attention Networks (GAT). To improve scalability in
large networks, we further propose Hierarchical Hub-based Adaptive Navigation
(HHAN), an extension of AN that assigns agents only to key intersections
(hubs). Vehicles are routed hub-to-hub under agent control, while SPF handles
micro-routing within each hub region. For hub coordination, HHAN adopts
centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) under the Attentive
Q-Mixing (A-QMIX) framework, which aggregates asynchronous vehicle decisions
via attention. Hub agents use flow-aware state features that combine local
congestion and predictive dynamics for proactive routing. Experiments on
synthetic grids and real urban maps (Toronto, Manhattan) show that AN reduces
average travel time versus SPF and learning baselines, maintaining 100% routing
success. HHAN scales to networks with hundreds of intersections, achieving up
to 15.9% improvement under heavy traffic. These findings highlight the
potential of network-constrained MARL for scalable, coordinated, and
congestion-aware routing in intelligent transportation systems.

*Nick Masi,Randall Balestriero*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了SAFE工具包，用于评估机器学习模型在地球不同区域的分层性能，超越传统的全局平均指标，揭示模型在不同地理、经济属性下的表现差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习评估基于测试集平均损失，这在地球天气和气候预测中忽略了人类发展和地理分布的不均匀性，无法反映模型在不同区域的真实表现。

Method: 开发SAFE工具包，整合多种数据域，按领土、全球子区域、收入水平和土地覆盖等属性对地球网格点进行分层，分析模型在每个分层中的性能。

Result: 使用SAFE评估多个最先进的AI天气预测模型，发现所有模型在不同属性上都存在预测技能差异，建立了基于不同提前时间和气候变量的模型预测公平性基准。

Conclusion: 通过超越全局平均指标，首次能够回答模型在哪些区域表现最佳或最差，以及哪些模型最公平。SAFE工具包开源，支持进一步研究。

Abstract: The dominant paradigm in machine learning is to assess model performance
based on average loss across all samples in some test set. This amounts to
averaging performance geospatially across the Earth in weather and climate
settings, failing to account for the non-uniform distribution of human
development and geography. We introduce Stratified Assessments of Forecasts
over Earth (SAFE), a package for elucidating the stratified performance of a
set of predictions made over Earth. SAFE integrates various data domains to
stratify by different attributes associated with geospatial gridpoints:
territory (usually country), global subregion, income, and landcover (land or
water). This allows us to examine the performance of models for each individual
stratum of the different attributes (e.g., the accuracy in every individual
country). To demonstrate its importance, we utilize SAFE to benchmark a zoo of
state-of-the-art AI-based weather prediction models, finding that they all
exhibit disparities in forecasting skill across every attribute. We use this to
seed a benchmark of model forecast fairness through stratification at different
lead times for various climatic variables. By moving beyond globally-averaged
metrics, we for the first time ask: where do models perform best or worst, and
which models are most fair? To support further work in this direction, the SAFE
package is open source and available at https://github.com/N-Masi/safe

TL;DR: 提出LTE方法，通过让LLM从自身生成的错误答案和过长响应中学习，解决RLVR中的探索停滞问题，无需外部专家指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法仅基于LLM自身生成的响应进行训练，受限于初始能力，容易出现探索停滞，无法解决更多训练问题。

Method: LTE方法提示LLM关注之前自我生成的错误答案和过长响应问题，无需外部专家指导。

Result: 在六个数学基准测试中，LTE比普通GRPO在Pass@1上平均提升6.38，在Pass@k上平均提升9.00。

Conclusion: LTE成功缓解了探索停滞问题，增强了训练过程中的利用和探索能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has significantly
boosted the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) recently.
However, existing RLVR approaches merely train LLMs based on their own
generated responses and are constrained by the initial capability of LLMs, thus
prone to exploration stagnation, in which LLMs fail to solve more training
problems and cannot further learn from the training data. Some work tries to
address this by leveraging off-policy solutions to training problems but
requires external guidance from experts which suffers from limited
availability. In this work, we propose LTE (Learning to reason from Trial and
Error), an approach hinting LLMs with their previously self-generated incorrect
answers and problem of overlong responses, which does not require any external
expert guidance. Experiments validate the effectiveness of LTE, which
outperforms the normal group relative policy optimization (GRPO) by 6.38 in
Pass@1 and 9.00 in Pass@k on average across six mathematics benchmarks for
Qwen3-4B-Base. Further analysis confirms that LTE successfully mitigates the
problem of exploration stagnation and enhances both exploitation and
exploration during training.

TL;DR: maxVSTAR是一个基于视觉引导的WiFi CSI活动识别模型自适应框架，通过跨模态师生架构实现边缘设备的自主领域适应，解决了环境变化导致的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WiFi CSI活动识别在边缘设备部署时面临领域偏移问题，环境变化导致识别性能严重下降，需要一种自主适应机制来维持长期稳定的识别能力。

Method: 采用跨模态师生架构，利用高精度YOLO视觉模型作为动态监督信号，为CSI数据流提供实时活动标签，在线微调轻量级CSI活动识别模型STAR，实现闭环重训练。

Result: 在未校准硬件上，基线STAR模型准确率从93.52%降至49.14%，经过一次视觉引导适应后，maxVSTAR将准确率恢复至81.51%。

Conclusion: maxVSTAR证明了在隐私敏感的物联网环境中实现动态、自监督模型适应的能力，为边缘CSI感知的长期自主活动识别建立了可扩展的实用范例。

Abstract: WiFi Channel State Information (CSI)-based human activity recognition (HAR)
provides a privacy-preserving, device-free sensing solution for smart
environments. However, its deployment on edge devices is severely constrained
by domain shift, where recognition performance deteriorates under varying
environmental and hardware conditions. This study presents maxVSTAR (maximally
adaptive Vision-guided Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition), a
closed-loop, vision-guided model adaptation framework that autonomously
mitigates domain shift for edge-deployed CSI sensing systems. The proposed
system integrates a cross-modal teacher-student architecture, where a
high-accuracy YOLO-based vision model serves as a dynamic supervisory signal,
delivering real-time activity labels for the CSI data stream. These labels
enable autonomous, online fine-tuning of a lightweight CSI-based HAR model,
termed Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition (STAR), directly at the
edge. This closed-loop retraining mechanism allows STAR to continuously adapt
to environmental changes without manual intervention. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of maxVSTAR. When deployed on uncalibrated
hardware, the baseline STAR model's recognition accuracy declined from 93.52%
to 49.14%. Following a single vision-guided adaptation cycle, maxVSTAR restored
the accuracy to 81.51%. These results confirm the system's capacity for
dynamic, self-supervised model adaptation in privacy-conscious IoT
environments, establishing a scalable and practical paradigm for long-term
autonomous HAR using CSI sensing at the network edge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Wi-Fi CSI活动识别方法在资源受限的移动边缘环境中存在计算效率低、延迟高和可行性有限的问题，需要开发适合嵌入式设备的实时高效解决方案。

Method: 采用轻量级GRU神经网络（比传统LSTM减少33%参数）、多阶段预处理（中值滤波、巴特沃斯低通滤波、经验模态分解）进行CSI数据去噪和特征提取，并在Rockchip RV1126处理器上部署。

Result: 在7种活动类别上达到93.52%的平均识别准确率，人体存在检测准确率99.11%；INT8量化推理处理速度33MHz，CPU利用率仅8%，比CPU执行快6倍；具有亚秒级响应延迟和低功耗。

Conclusion: STAR框架为移动和普适计算环境提供了实用、可扩展的实时隐私保护活动识别解决方案，在嵌入式设备上实现了高效性能。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) via Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI)
presents a privacy-preserving, contactless sensing approach suitable for smart
homes, healthcare monitoring, and mobile IoT systems. However, existing methods
often encounter computational inefficiency, high latency, and limited
feasibility within resource-constrained, embedded mobile edge environments.
This paper proposes STAR (Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition), an
edge-AI-optimized framework that integrates a lightweight neural architecture,
adaptive signal processing, and hardware-aware co-optimization to enable
real-time, energy-efficient HAR on low-power embedded devices. STAR
incorporates a streamlined Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-based recurrent neural
network, reducing model parameters by 33% compared to conventional LSTM models
while maintaining effective temporal modeling capability. A multi-stage
pre-processing pipeline combining median filtering, 8th-order Butterworth
low-pass filtering, and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is employed to
denoise CSI amplitude data and extract spatial-temporal features. For on-device
deployment, STAR is implemented on a Rockchip RV1126 processor equipped with an
embedded Neural Processing Unit (NPU), interfaced with an ESP32-S3-based CSI
acquisition module. Experimental results demonstrate a mean recognition
accuracy of 93.52% across seven activity classes and 99.11% for human presence
detection, utilizing a compact 97.6k-parameter model. INT8 quantized inference
achieves a processing speed of 33 MHz with just 8% CPU utilization, delivering
sixfold speed improvements over CPU-based execution. With sub-second response
latency and low power consumption, the system ensures real-time,
privacy-preserving HAR, offering a practical, scalable solution for mobile and
pervasive computing environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型难以捕捉分子与其描述之间的细微差异，缺乏学习分子子结构与化学短语之间细粒度对齐的能力。

Method: 通过分子子结构和化学短语的额外对齐信号增强原始分子-描述对，采用子结构感知对比学习和自精炼机制来过滤噪声对齐信号。

Result: MolBridge在多个分子基准测试中有效捕捉细粒度对应关系，并优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 子结构感知对齐在分子-文本学习中具有重要意义，MolBridge框架展示了其在提升化学信息理解方面的有效性。

Abstract: Molecule and text representation learning has gained increasing interest due
to its potential for enhancing the understanding of chemical information.
However, existing models often struggle to capture subtle differences between
molecules and their descriptions, as they lack the ability to learn
fine-grained alignments between molecular substructures and chemical phrases.
To address this limitation, we introduce MolBridge, a novel molecule-text
learning framework based on substructure-aware alignments. Specifically, we
augment the original molecule-description pairs with additional alignment
signals derived from molecular substructures and chemical phrases. To
effectively learn from these enriched alignments, MolBridge employs
substructure-aware contrastive learning, coupled with a self-refinement
mechanism that filters out noisy alignment signals. Experimental results show
that MolBridge effectively captures fine-grained correspondences and
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on a wide range of molecular benchmarks,
highlighting the significance of substructure-aware alignment in molecule-text
learning.

Result: 复杂方法表现不佳，而简单集成模型实现了AUC-ROC 0.976、F1分数0.41，并在定义时间窗口内达到100%的早期检测率。

Conclusion: 在高度不平衡和时间不确定的数据场景下，模型简单性结合优化分割可以超越更复杂的架构，提供更好的鲁棒性、可解释性和操作实用性。

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of advanced feature
engineering and hybrid model architectures for anomaly detection in a
multivariate industrial time series, focusing on a steam turbine system. We
evaluate the impact of change point-derived statistical features,
clustering-based substructure representations, and hybrid learning strategies
on detection performance. Despite their theoretical appeal, these complex
approaches consistently underperformed compared to a simple Random Forest +
XGBoost ensemble trained on segmented data. The ensemble achieved an AUC-ROC of
0.976, F1-score of 0.41, and 100% early detection within the defined time
window. Our findings highlight that, in scenarios with highly imbalanced and
temporally uncertain data, model simplicity combined with optimized

Method: 将CPRA问题建模为势博弈，提出GSTRL框架，结合博弈论和强化学习来捕捉系统时空动态。

Result: 在两个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，GSTRL框架表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: GSTRL为CPRA问题提供了理论基础和有效解决方案，能够近似纳什均衡并处理时空动态。

Abstract: Public resource allocation involves the efficient distribution of resources,
including urban infrastructure, energy, and transportation, to effectively meet
societal demands. However, existing methods focus on optimizing the movement of
individual resources independently, without considering their capacity
constraints. To address this limitation, we propose a novel and more practical
problem: Collaborative Public Resource Allocation (CPRA), which explicitly
incorporates capacity constraints and spatio-temporal dynamics in real-world
scenarios. We propose a new framework called Game-Theoretic Spatio-Temporal
Reinforcement Learning (GSTRL) for solving CPRA. Our contributions are twofold:
1) We formulate the CPRA problem as a potential game and demonstrate that there
is no gap between the potential function and the optimal target, laying a solid
theoretical foundation for approximating the Nash equilibrium of this NP-hard
problem; and 2) Our designed GSTRL framework effectively captures the
spatio-temporal dynamics of the overall system. We evaluate GSTRL on two
real-world datasets, where experiments show its superior performance. Our
source codes are available in the supplementary materials.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准SGD-IE方法忽略了跨epoch的复合效应，导致对关键样本的错误排名，需要更精确的逐样本影响估计

Method: ACC-SGD-IE：轨迹感知估计器，在训练过程中传播留一扰动，并在每个步骤更新累积影响状态

Result: 在平滑强凸设置中实现几何误差收缩，在平滑非凸情况下收紧误差界限；在多个数据集上产生更准确的影响估计，特别是在长epoch中

Conclusion: ACC-SGD-IE在数据清洗中更可靠地标记噪声样本，使用该方法清洗数据训练的模型优于使用SGD-IE清洗的模型

Abstract: Modern data-centric AI needs precise per-sample influence. Standard SGD-IE
approximates leave-one-out effects by summing per-epoch surrogates and ignores
cross-epoch compounding, which misranks critical examples. We propose
ACC-SGD-IE, a trajectory-aware estimator that propagates the leave-one-out
perturbation across training and updates an accumulative influence state at
each step. In smooth strongly convex settings it achieves geometric error
contraction and, in smooth non-convex regimes, it tightens error bounds; larger
mini-batches further reduce constants. Empirically, on Adult, 20 Newsgroups,
and MNIST under clean and corrupted data and both convex and non-convex
training, ACC-SGD-IE yields more accurate influence estimates, especially over
long epochs. For downstream data cleansing it more reliably flags noisy
samples, producing models trained on ACC-SGD-IE cleaned data that outperform
those cleaned with SGD-IE.

Result: 随机森林模型表现最佳，其次是逻辑回归和支持向量机模型。

Conclusion: 这些模型可识别导致再入院的关键因素，帮助确定需要重点关注的患者，从而降低再入院率、减少成本并提高医疗质量。

Abstract: Reducing preventable hospital readmissions is a national priority for payers,
providers, and policymakers seeking to improve health care and lower costs. The
rate of readmission is being used as a benchmark to determine the quality of
healthcare provided by the hospitals. In thisproject, we have used machine
learning techniques like Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Support Vector
Machines to analyze the health claims data and identify demographic and medical
factors that play a crucial role in predicting all-cause readmissions. As the
health claims data is high dimensional, we have used Principal Component
Analysis as a dimension reduction technique and used the results for building
regression models. We compared and evaluated these models based on the Area
Under Curve (AUC) metric. Random Forest model gave the highest performance
followed by Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine models. These models
can be used to identify the crucial factors causing readmissions and help
identify patients to focus on to reduce the chances of readmission, ultimately
bringing down the cost and increasing the quality of healthcare provided to the
patients.

Result: AISP在奖励与使用样本数量方面优于最佳n采样，并比其他基于奖励的测试时对齐方法获得更高奖励。

Conclusion: AISP是一种有效的测试时对齐方法，能够在不需要微调的情况下提升模型性能。

Abstract: Test-time alignment of large language models (LLMs) attracts attention
because fine-tuning LLMs requires high computational costs. In this paper, we
propose a new test-time alignment method called adaptive importance sampling on
pre-logits (AISP) on the basis of the sampling-based model predictive control
with the stochastic control input. AISP applies the Gaussian perturbation into
pre-logits, which are outputs of the penultimate layer, so as to maximize
expected rewards with respect to the mean of the perturbation. We demonstrate
that the optimal mean is obtained by importance sampling with sampled rewards.
AISP outperforms best-of-n sampling in terms of rewards over the number of used
samples and achieves higher rewards than other reward-based test-time alignment
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习遗忘方法在现实部署中面临可扩展性问题，需要访问完整原始数据集和模型，而本方法旨在解决这些实际挑战。

Method: 采用归纳方法将分类训练视为顺序过程，通过反转最后训练序列实现遗忘，在模型末尾添加投影重分布层作为输出过滤器。

Result: 在多个数据集（CIFAR-10/100、Covertype）上的实验表明，该方法输出与完全重新训练模型相似，同时大幅降低计算成本。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持输出性能的同时，展示了适用性、可扩展性和系统兼容性，为实际部署提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: As a new and promising approach, existing machine unlearning (MU) works
typically emphasize theoretical formulations or optimization objectives to
achieve knowledge removal. However, when deployed in real-world scenarios, such
solutions typically face scalability issues and have to address practical
requirements such as full access to original datasets and model. In contrast to
the existing approaches, we regard classification training as a sequential
process where classes are learned sequentially, which we call \emph{inductive
approach}. Unlearning can then be done by reversing the last training sequence.
This is implemented by appending a projection-redistribution layer in the end
of the model. Such an approach does not require full access to the original
dataset or the model, addressing the challenges of existing methods. This
enables modular and model-agnostic deployment as an output filter into existing
classification pipelines with minimal alterations. We conducted multiple
experiments across multiple datasets including image (CIFAR-10/100 using
CNN-based model) and tabular datasets (Covertype using tree-based model).
Experiment results show consistently similar output to a fully retrained model
with a high computational cost reduction. This demonstrates the applicability,
scalability, and system compatibility of our solution while maintaining the

*Hieu M. Vu,Tan M. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Angular Steering方法，通过旋转激活向量在二维子空间内实现行为调控，相比现有方法更灵活稳定


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型行为控制方法（如向量加法和方向消融）局限于二维子空间，对参数选择敏感且可能影响无关特征，需要更灵活稳定的调控方法

Method: Angular Steering：在固定二维子空间内旋转激活向量，将行为调控表述为朝向或远离目标行为方向的几何旋转；Adaptive Angular Steering：仅旋转与目标特征对齐的激活

Result: 在多个模型家族和规模上实验表明，Angular Steering实现了鲁棒的行为控制，同时保持通用语言建模性能，相比现有方法具有更好的灵活性、泛化性和鲁棒性

Conclusion: Angular Steering将现有加法和正交化技术统一到几何旋转框架下，简化参数选择，在更广泛的调整范围内保持模型稳定性

Abstract: Controlling specific behaviors in large language models while preserving
their general capabilities is a central challenge for safe and reliable
artificial intelligence deployment. Current steering methods, such as vector
addition and directional ablation, are constrained within a two-dimensional
subspace defined by the activation and feature direction, making them sensitive
to chosen parameters and potentially affecting unrelated features due to
unintended interactions in activation space. We introduce Angular Steering, a
novel and flexible method for behavior modulation that operates by rotating
activations within a fixed two-dimensional subspace. By formulating steering as
a geometric rotation toward or away from a target behavior direction, Angular
Steering provides continuous, fine-grained control over behaviors such as
refusal and compliance. We demonstrate this method using refusal steering
emotion steering as use cases. Additionally, we propose Adaptive Angular
Steering, a selective variant that rotates only activations aligned with the
target feature, further enhancing stability and coherence. Angular Steering
generalizes existing addition and orthogonalization techniques under a unified
geometric rotation framework, simplifying parameter selection and maintaining
model stability across a broader range of adjustments. Experiments across
multiple model families and sizes show that Angular Steering achieves robust
behavioral control while maintaining general language modeling performance,
underscoring its flexibility, generalization, and robustness compared to prior
approaches. Code and artifacts are available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需额外训练即可计算生成模型中插值路径的通用方法，该方法在数据分布约束下模拟测地线，能够穿越高密度区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数生成模型缺乏对插值路径的严格定义，需要限制模型或数据维度的假设，这限制了插值在可控生成和模型检查中的应用。

Method: 开发了一种通用插值方案，针对与不同度量和概率分布兼容的似然过渡路径，推导出无需额外训练的计算算法，局部可视为黎曼度量下的测地线。

Result: 定量实验表明，该方法在多种模型和数据集上比基线方法更能穿越高密度区域。

Conclusion: 该方法为生成模型提供了一种无需额外训练的插值方案，能够更好地遵循数据分布，在模型检查和可控生成中具有应用价值。

Abstract: Interpolation in generative models allows for controlled generation, model
inspection, and more. Unfortunately, most generative models lack a principal
notion of interpolants without restrictive assumptions on either the model or
data dimension. In this paper, we develop a general interpolation scheme that
targets likely transition paths compatible with different metrics and
probability distributions. We consider interpolants analogous to a geodesic
constrained to a suitable data distribution and derive a novel algorithm for
computing these curves, which requires no additional training. Theoretically,
we show that our method locally can be considered as a geodesic under a
suitable Riemannian metric. We quantitatively show that our interpolation
scheme traverses higher density regions than baselines across a range of models
and datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了IMG算法，在扩散模型推理时进行多目标优化，通过加权重采样策略生成满足多个目标的样本，相比基线方法显著提高了超体积指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将扩散模型视为黑盒精炼器，忽略了扩散生成过程中的内部分布转换，限制了效率。需要直接在推理时优化扩散过程来同时满足多个目标。

Method: IMG算法在扩散生成过程中根据期望聚合多目标值进行加权重采样，确保生成的样本符合期望的多目标玻尔兹曼分布。

Result: 在多目标分子生成任务中，IMG仅需单次生成就能实现比需要数百次扩散生成的基线优化算法显著更高的超体积。

Conclusion: IMG算法可视为优化的扩散过程，能够集成到现有方法中进一步提升性能，多目标玻尔兹曼分布是分布多目标优化问题的最优解。

Abstract: Diffusion models have been successful in learning complex data distributions.
This capability has driven their application to high-dimensional
multi-objective black-box optimization problem. Existing approaches often
employ an external optimization loop, such as an evolutionary algorithm, to the
diffusion model. However, these approaches treat the diffusion model as a
black-box refiner, which overlooks the internal distribution transition of the
diffusion generation process, limiting their efficiency. To address these
challenges, we propose the Inference-time Multi-target Generation (IMG)
algorithm, which optimizes the diffusion process at inference-time to generate
samples that simultaneously satisfy multiple objectives. Specifically, our IMG
performs weighted resampling during the diffusion generation process according
to the expected aggregated multi-objective values. This weighted resampling
strategy ensures the diffusion-generated samples are distributed according to
our desired multi-target Boltzmann distribution. We further derive that the
multi-target Boltzmann distribution has an interesting log-likelihood
interpretation, where it is the optimal solution to the distributional
multi-objective optimization problem. We implemented IMG for a multi-objective
molecule generation task. Experiments show that IMG, requiring only a single
generation pass, achieves a significantly higher hypervolume than baseline
optimization algorithms that often require hundreds of diffusion generations.
Notably, our algorithm can be viewed as an optimized diffusion process and can
be integrated into existing methods to further improve their performance.

Abstract: Multi-task learning in contextual bandits has attracted significant research
interest due to its potential to enhance decision-making across multiple
related tasks by leveraging shared structures and task-specific heterogeneity.
In this article, we propose a novel hierarchical Bayesian framework for
learning in various bandit instances. This framework captures both the
heterogeneity and the correlations among different bandit instances through a
hierarchical Bayesian model, enabling effective information sharing while
accommodating instance-specific variations. Unlike previous methods that
overlook the learning of the covariance structure across bandits, we introduce
an empirical Bayesian approach to estimate the covariance matrix of the prior
distribution.This enhances both the practicality and flexibility of learning
across multi-bandits. Building on this approach, we develop two efficient
algorithms: ebmTS (Empirical Bayesian Multi-Bandit Thompson Sampling) and
ebmUCB (Empirical Bayesian Multi-Bandit Upper Confidence Bound), both of which
incorporate the estimated prior into the decision-making process. We provide
the frequentist regret upper bounds for the proposed algorithms, thereby
filling a research gap in the field of multi-bandit problems. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior
performance of our algorithms, particularly in complex environments. Our
methods achieve lower cumulative regret compared to existing techniques,
highlighting their effectiveness in balancing exploration and exploitation
across multi-bandits.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了离线偏好学习中的聚类问题，提出了两种算法来处理多用户偏好差异和数据不平衡的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的偏好学习涉及具有不同偏好的用户，且离线数据往往不平衡，这带来了两个核心挑战：识别用户相似性以有效聚合数据，以及处理某些偏好维度代表性不足的问题。

Method: 提出了Off-C²PL算法用于纯离线设置，以及A²-Off-C²PL算法用于允许有限主动数据增强的设置，后者主动选择针对测试用户最不具信息性偏好维度的样本。

Result: 理论分析表明主动收集的样本比离线样本更有效，并在合成和真实数据集上的模拟验证了理论结果。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架能够有效处理多用户偏好学习和数据不平衡问题，通过聚类和主动学习策略提高了偏好学习的性能。

Abstract: Preference learning from pairwise feedback is a widely adopted framework in
applications such as reinforcement learning with human feedback and
recommendations. In many practical settings, however, user interactions are
limited or costly, making offline preference learning necessary. Moreover,
real-world preference learning often involves users with different preferences.
For example, annotators from different backgrounds may rank the same responses
differently. This setting presents two central challenges: (1) identifying
similarity across users to effectively aggregate data, especially under
scenarios where offline data is imbalanced across dimensions, and (2) handling
the imbalanced offline data where some preference dimensions are
underrepresented. To address these challenges, we study the Offline Clustering
of Preference Learning problem, where the learner has access to fixed datasets
from multiple users with potentially different preferences and aims to maximize
utility for a test user. To tackle the first challenge, we first propose
Off-C$^2$PL for the pure offline setting, where the learner relies solely on
offline data. Our theoretical analysis provides a suboptimality bound that
explicitly captures the tradeoff between sample noise and bias. To address the
second challenge of inbalanced data, we extend our framework to the setting
with active-data augmentation where the learner is allowed to select a limited
number of additional active-data for the test user based on the cluster
structure learned by Off-C$^2$PL. In this setting, our second algorithm,
A$^2$-Off-C$^2$PL, actively selects samples that target the least-informative
dimensions of the test user's preference. We prove that these actively
collected samples contribute more effectively than offline ones. Finally, we
validate our theoretical results through simulations on synthetic and
real-world datasets.

*Ziliang Chen,Tianang Xiao,Jusheng Zhang,Yongsen Zheng,Xipeng Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于token感知的因果表示学习框架，通过语言token的结构因果模型来解释CLIP在组合推理上的脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在跨模态泛化方面表现优异，但在对象、属性和关系的组合推理上持续失败，现有因果解释通常将文本建模为单一向量，无法解释token级结构和核心现象。

Method: 建立了基于语言token的顺序结构因果模型，将块可识别性扩展到token化文本，证明CLIP的对比目标可以在句子级和token级SCM下恢复模态不变潜变量。

Result: 发现存在伪最优文本编码器，虽然实现了完美的模态不变对齐，但对原子概念的SWAP、REPLACE和ADD操作不敏感，无法区分正确标题和困难负样本。

Conclusion: 语言侧的非可识别性通过模态间隙与视觉侧失败相关联，迭代组合操作增加了难度，需要改进负样本挖掘策略。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) delivers strong cross modal
generalization by aligning images and texts in a shared embedding space, yet it
persistently fails at compositional reasoning over objects, attributes, and
relations often behaving like a bag-of-words matcher. Prior causal accounts
typically model text as a single vector, obscuring token-level structure and
leaving core phenomena-such as prompt sensitivity and failures on hard
negatives unexplained. We address this gap with a token-aware causal
representation learning (CRL) framework grounded in a sequential,
language-token SCM. Our theory extends block identifiability to tokenized text,
proving that CLIP's contrastive objective can recover the modal-invariant
latent variable under both sentence-level and token-level SCMs. Crucially,
token granularity yields the first principled explanation of CLIP's
compositional brittleness: composition nonidentifiability. We show the
existence of pseudo-optimal text encoders that achieve perfect modal-invariant
alignment yet are provably insensitive to SWAP, REPLACE, and ADD operations
over atomic concepts, thereby failing to distinguish correct captions from hard
negatives despite optimizing the same training objective as true-optimal
encoders. The analysis further links language-side nonidentifiability to
visual-side failures via the modality gap and shows how iterated composition
operators compound hardness, motivating improved negative mining strategies.

*Beomhan Baek,Minhak Song,Chulhee Yun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了增量Adam优化器在线性可分数据上的隐式偏差，发现其与全批次Adam不同，可能收敛到ℓ₂-最大间隔分类器而非ℓ∞-最大间隔分类器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adam优化器在深度学习中被广泛使用，但其理论理解仍然有限。先前分析表明Adam偏好ℓ∞-几何解，但这些结果仅限于全批次情况。本文旨在研究增量Adam（每步使用一个样本）在线性可分数据上的隐式偏差。

Method: 构建结构化数据集来证明增量Adam收敛到ℓ₂-最大间隔分类器；开发代理算法捕捉β₂→1时增量Adam的极限行为；通过数据依赖的双重定点公式表征收敛方向；比较Signum优化器的行为。

Result: 增量Adam的隐式偏差偏离全批次行为，在特定数据集上收敛到ℓ₂-最大间隔分类器；Signum在任何批次大小下都收敛到ℓ∞-最大间隔分类器。

Conclusion: Adam的隐式偏差关键取决于批次方案和数据集，而Signum保持不变。这揭示了优化器行为对训练设置的敏感性。

Abstract: Adam [Kingma and Ba, 2015] is the de facto optimizer in deep learning, yet
its theoretical understanding remains limited. Prior analyses show that Adam
favors solutions aligned with $\ell_\infty$-geometry, but these results are
restricted to the full-batch regime. In this work, we study the implicit bias
of incremental Adam (using one sample per step) for logistic regression on
linearly separable data, and we show that its bias can deviate from the
full-batch behavior. To illustrate this, we construct a class of structured
datasets where incremental Adam provably converges to the $\ell_2$-max-margin
classifier, in contrast to the $\ell_\infty$-max-margin bias of full-batch
Adam. For general datasets, we develop a proxy algorithm that captures the
limiting behavior of incremental Adam as $\beta_2 \to 1$ and we characterize
its convergence direction via a data-dependent dual fixed-point formulation.
Finally, we prove that, unlike Adam, Signum [Bernstein et al., 2018] converges
to the $\ell_\infty$-max-margin classifier for any batch size by taking $\beta$
close enough to 1. Overall, our results highlight that the implicit bias of
Adam crucially depends on both the batching scheme and the dataset, while
Signum remains invariant.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无数据持续学习方法，通过模型反演生成伪数据来避免存储历史数据，解决了隐私和存储限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统持续学习需要存储和回放历史数据，但在隐私保护或安全约束下不可行，且对于预训练模型不实用。无数据持续学习旨在不访问历史数据的情况下更新模型。

Method: 提出分层模型反演(PMI)方法，通过单层优化提供强初始化，大幅减少反演迭代次数；同时使用高斯分布和对比模型建模类特征，确保合成特征与真实特征对齐。

Result: 该方法能够在多个持续学习设置中有效学习新类别，通过从语义感知投影特征生成伪图像，实现了强大的有效性和兼容性。

Conclusion: 结合PMI和特征建模的方法为无数据持续学习提供了高效解决方案，特别适用于大型预训练模型如CLIP，解决了模型反演中的计算效率和特征偏移问题。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to incrementally train a model on a sequence of
tasks while retaining performance on prior ones. However, storing and replaying
data is often infeasible due to privacy or security constraints and impractical
for arbitrary pre-trained models. Data-free CL seeks to update models without
access to previous data. Beyond regularization, we employ model inversion to
synthesize data from the trained model, enabling replay without storing
samples. Yet, model inversion in predictive models faces two challenges: (1)
generating inputs solely from compressed output labels causes drift between
synthetic and real data, and replaying such data can erode prior knowledge; (2)
inversion is computationally expensive since each step backpropagates through
the full model. These issues are amplified in large pre-trained models such as
CLIP. To improve efficiency, we propose Per-layer Model Inversion (PMI),
inspired by faster convergence in single-layer optimization. PMI provides
strong initialization for full-model inversion, substantially reducing
iterations. To mitigate feature shift, we model class-wise features via
Gaussian distributions and contrastive model, ensuring alignment between
synthetic and real features. Combining PMI and feature modeling, our approach
enables continual learning of new classes by generating pseudo-images from
semantic-aware projected features, achieving strong effectiveness and
compatibility across multiple CL settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索量子退火在SVM训练中的应用潜力，特别是研究量子比特数（对应双权重离散化水平）如何影响模型性能。

Method: 将SVM训练转化为QUBO问题，使用量子退火进行模型优化，比较不同比特精度编码的QUBO-SVM与经典LIBSVM求解器的性能。

Result: 即使低精度QUBO编码（如每个参数1比特）也能获得有竞争力甚至更优的准确率；增加比特深度虽然允许更大的正则化参数，但并不总能改善分类性能。

Conclusion: 选择合适的支持向量可能比精确的权重更重要；虽然当前硬件限制了可求解QUBO问题的规模，但研究结果显示了量子退火在SVM训练中的潜力，特别是随着量子设备的发展。

Abstract: Training Support Vector Machines (SVMs) can be formulated as a QUBO problem,
enabling the use of quantum annealing for model optimization. In this work, we
study how the number of qubits - linked to the discretization level of dual
weights - affects predictive performance across datasets. We compare QUBO-based
SVM training to the classical LIBSVM solver and find that even low-precision
QUBO encodings (e.g., 1 bit per parameter) yield competitive, and sometimes
superior, accuracy. While increased bit-depth enables larger regularization
parameters, it does not always improve classification. Our findings suggest
that selecting the right support vectors may matter more than their precise
weighting. Although current hardware limits the size of solvable QUBOs, our
results highlight the potential of quantum annealing for efficient SVM training
as quantum devices scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后验采样在图像修复、去模糊和MRI重建等任务中很重要，但近似后验采样在计算上通常是难解的。现有方法如Langevin动力学对分数估计误差敏感，需要更强的误差界。

Method: 结合扩散模型和退火Langevin动力学，在log-concave分布假设下进行条件采样。

Result: 该方法在多项式时间内实现后验采样，仅需L^4分数误差界，比传统Langevin动力学所需的次指数误差界更宽松。

Conclusion: 该工作为条件采样提供了更实用的理论保证，降低了分数估计精度的要求，使后验采样在更广泛场景中可行。

Abstract: Given a noisy linear measurement $y = Ax + \xi$ of a distribution $p(x)$, and
a good approximation to the prior $p(x)$, when can we sample from the posterior
$p(x \mid y)$? Posterior sampling provides an accurate and fair framework for
tasks such as inpainting, deblurring, and MRI reconstruction, and several
heuristics attempt to approximate it. Unfortunately, approximate posterior
sampling is computationally intractable in general.
  To sidestep this hardness, we focus on (local or global) log-concave
distributions $p(x)$. In this regime, Langevin dynamics yields posterior
samples when the exact scores of $p(x)$ are available, but it is brittle to
score--estimation error, requiring an MGF bound (sub-exponential error). By
contrast, in the unconditional setting, diffusion models succeed with only an
$L^2$ bound on the score error. We prove that combining diffusion models with
an annealed variant of Langevin dynamics achieves conditional sampling in
polynomial time using merely an $L^4$ bound on the score error.

TL;DR: 该论文揭示了前沿LLM公司推出的Agent Skills框架存在严重安全漏洞，攻击者可以通过简单的提示注入技术窃取敏感数据，并能绕过系统级防护机制。


<details>

Motivation: 研究Agent Skills框架的安全性，因为虽然该框架为LLM提供持续学习能力很有用，但其安全漏洞可能导致严重的数据泄露风险。

Method: 通过在长Agent Skill文件和引用脚本中隐藏恶意指令，演示如何窃取内部文件和密码等敏感数据，并展示如何绕过流行编码代理的系统级防护机制。

Result: 成功演示了Agent Skills框架对简单提示注入攻击的脆弱性，攻击者能够绕过"不再询问"等防护机制执行有害操作。

Conclusion: 尽管LLM能力不断提升且持续学习研究不断推进，前沿LLM在实际场景中仍然容易受到简单提示注入攻击，安全防护机制存在根本性缺陷。

Abstract: Enabling continual learning in LLMs remains a key unresolved research
challenge. In a recent announcement, a frontier LLM company made a step towards
this by introducing Agent Skills, a framework that equips agents with new
knowledge based on instructions stored in simple markdown files. Although Agent
Skills can be a very useful tool, we show that they are fundamentally insecure,
since they enable trivially simple prompt injections. We demonstrate how to
hide malicious instructions in long Agent Skill files and referenced scripts to
exfiltrate sensitive data, such as internal files or passwords. Importantly, we
show how to bypass system-level guardrails of a popular coding agent: a benign,
task-specific approval with the "Don't ask again" option can carry over to
closely related but harmful actions. Overall, we conclude that despite ongoing
research efforts and scaling model capabilities, frontier LLMs remain
vulnerable to very simple prompt injections in realistic scenarios. Our code is

Abstract: Incorporating causal knowledge and mechanisms is essential for refining
causal models and improving downstream tasks such as designing new treatments.
In this paper, we introduce a novel concept in causal discovery, termed
interventional constraints, which differs fundamentally from interventional
data. While interventional data require direct perturbations of variables,
interventional constraints encode high-level causal knowledge in the form of
inequality constraints on causal effects. For instance, in the Sachs dataset
(Sachs et al.\ 2005), Akt has been shown to be activated by PIP3, meaning PIP3
exerts a positive causal effect on Akt. Existing causal discovery methods allow
enforcing structural constraints (for example, requiring a causal path from
PIP3 to Akt), but they may still produce incorrect causal conclusions such as
learning that "PIP3 inhibits Akt". Interventional constraints bridge this gap
by explicitly constraining the total causal effect between variable pairs,
ensuring learned models respect known causal influences. To formalize
interventional constraints, we propose a metric to quantify total causal
effects for linear causal models and formulate the problem as a constrained
optimization task, solved using a two-stage constrained optimization method. We
evaluate our approach on real-world datasets and demonstrate that integrating
interventional constraints not only improves model accuracy and ensures
consistency with established findings, making models more explainable, but also
facilitates the discovery of new causal relationships that would otherwise be
costly to identify.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are designed to optimize
problem-solving by learning actions that maximize rewards, a task that becomes
particularly challenging in random and nonstationary environments. Even
advanced RL algorithms are often limited in their ability to solve problems in
these conditions. In applications such as searching for underwater pollution
clouds with autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), RL algorithms must navigate
reward-sparse environments, where actions frequently result in a zero reward.
This paper aims to address these challenges by revisiting and modifying
classical RL approaches to efficiently operate in sparse, randomized, and
nonstationary environments. We systematically study a large number of
modifications, including hierarchical algorithm changes, multigoal learning,
and the integration of a location memory as an external output filter to
prevent state revisits. Our results demonstrate that a modified Monte
Carlo-based approach significantly outperforms traditional Q-learning and two
exhaustive search patterns, illustrating its potential in adapting RL to
complex environments. These findings suggest that reinforcement learning
approaches can be effectively adapted for use in random, nonstationary, and
reward-sparse environments.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a key paradigm for collaborative model
training across multiple clients without sharing raw data, enabling
privacy-preserving applications in areas such as radiology and pathology.
However, works on collaborative training across clients with fundamentally
different neural architectures and non-identically distributed datasets remain
scarce. Existing FL frameworks face several limitations. Despite claiming to
support architectural heterogeneity, most recent FL methods only tolerate
variants within a single model family (e.g., shallower, deeper, or wider CNNs),
still presuming a shared global architecture and failing to accommodate
federations where clients deploy fundamentally different network types (e.g.,
CNNs, GNNs, MLPs). Moreover, existing approaches often address only statistical
heterogeneity while overlooking the domain-fracture problem, where each
client's data distribution differs markedly from that faced at testing time,
undermining model generalizability. When clients use different architectures,
have non-identically distributed data, and encounter distinct test domains,
current methods perform poorly. To address these challenges, we propose
UnifiedFL, a dynamic federated learning framework that represents heterogeneous
local networks as nodes and edges in a directed model graph optimized by a
shared graph neural network (GNN). UnifiedFL introduces (i) a common GNN to
parameterize all architectures, (ii) distance-driven clustering via Euclidean
distances between clients' parameters, and (iii) a two-tier aggregation policy
balancing convergence and diversity. Experiments on MedMNIST classification and
hippocampus segmentation benchmarks demonstrate UnifiedFL's superior
performance. Code and data: https://github.com/basiralab/UnifiedFL

Abstract: Financial forecasting increasingly uses large neural network models, but
their opacity raises challenges for trust and regulatory compliance. We present
several approaches to explainable and reliable AI in finance. \emph{First}, we
describe how Time-LLM, a time series foundation model, uses a prompt to avoid a
wrong directional forecast. \emph{Second}, we show that combining foundation
models for time series forecasting with a reliability estimator can filter our
unreliable predictions. \emph{Third}, we argue for symbolic reasoning encoding
domain rules for transparent justification. These approaches shift emphasize
executing only forecasts that are both reliable and explainable. Experiments on
equity and cryptocurrency data show that the architecture reduces false
positives and supports selective execution. By integrating predictive
performance with reliability estimation and rule-based reasoning, our framework
advances transparent and auditable financial AI systems.

Motivation: 在工业物流仓库中，工人定位数据对提高生产力至关重要。虽然摄像头能提供有价值的环境信息，但仅凭视觉数据识别个体通常不切实际。现有方法通过比较轨迹和可穿戴传感器测量来识别人员，但在现实条件下可能失效。

Result: 开发了包含实际仓库操作的数据集，证明了该方法在现实应用中的有效性

Conclusion: CorVS方法能够有效解决现实条件下的人员识别问题，为工业物流仓库提供可靠的人员定位解决方案

Abstract: Worker location data is key to higher productivity in industrial sites.
Cameras are a promising tool for localization in logistics warehouses since
they also offer valuable environmental contexts such as package status.
However, identifying individuals with only visual data is often impractical.
Accordingly, several prior studies identified people in videos by comparing
their trajectories and wearable sensor measurements. While this approach has
advantages such as independence from appearance, the existing methods may break
down under real-world conditions. To overcome this challenge, we propose CorVS,
a novel data-driven person identification method based on correspondence
between visual tracking trajectories and sensor measurements. Firstly, our deep
learning model predicts correspondence probabilities and reliabilities for
every pair of a trajectory and sensor measurements. Secondly, our algorithm
matches the trajectories and sensor measurements over time using the predicted
probabilities and reliabilities. We developed a dataset with actual warehouse
operations and demonstrated the method's effectiveness for real-world
applications.

TL;DR: 开发基于Flow Matching的生成式AI模型FM-Cast，用于平流层环流的概率预报，在18次SSW事件中表现出色，计算效率远高于传统NWP系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 突发平流层增温(SSW)是次季节可预报性的关键来源，但传统数值天气预报系统在物理表示、初始化和计算需求方面存在局限，数据驱动方法在SSW的复杂三维动力学应用方面仍待探索。

Method: 使用Flow Matching生成式AI模型FM-Cast，构建平流层环流时空演化的概率预报系统，通过理想化实验分析SSW可预报性与物理驱动因素的关系。

Result: 在1998-2024年18次主要SSW事件中，FM-Cast能提前20天准确预报10次事件的发生、强度和形态，集合准确率超过50%，性能媲美或优于领先NWP系统，在消费级GPU上仅需2分钟完成50成员30天预报。

Conclusion: 建立计算高效的平流层异常概率预报新范式，展示生成式AI在加深大气-气候动力学物理理解方面的潜力，证明SSW可预报性与其物理驱动因素密切相关。

Abstract: Sudden Stratospheric Warmings (SSWs) are key sources of subseasonal
predictability and major drivers of extreme winter weather. Yet, their accurate
and efficient forecast remains a persistent challenge for numerical weather
prediction (NWP) systems due to limitations in physical representation,
initialization, and the immense computational demands of ensemble forecasts.
While data-driven forecasting is rapidly evolving, its application to the
complex, three-dimensional dynamics of SSWs, particularly for probabilistic
forecast, remains underexplored. Here, we bridge this gap by developing a Flow
Matching-based generative AI model (FM-Cast) for efficient and skillful
probabilistic forecasting of the spatiotemporal evolution of stratospheric
circulation. Evaluated across 18 major SSW events (1998-2024), FM-Cast
skillfully forecasts the onset, intensity, and morphology of 10 events up to 20
days in advance, achieving ensemble accuracies above 50%. Its performance is
comparable to or exceeds leading NWP systems while requiring only two minutes
for a 50-member, 30-day forecast on a consumer GPU. Furthermore, leveraging
FM-Cast as a scientific tool, we demonstrate through idealized experiments that
SSW predictability is fundamentally linked to its underlying physical drivers,
distinguishing between events forced from the troposphere and those driven by
internal stratospheric dynamics. Our work thus establishes a computationally
efficient paradigm for probabilistic forecasting stratospheric anomalies and
showcases generative AI's potential to deepen the physical understanding of
atmosphere-climate dynamics.

Conclusion: 该方法通过自适应上下文长度优化和有效信息表示，显著提升了多智能体强化学习的探索效率和收敛性能。

Abstract: Recently, deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has demonstrated
promising performance for solving challenging tasks, such as long-term
dependencies and non-Markovian environments. Its success is partly attributed
to conditioning policies on large fixed context length. However, such large
fixed context lengths may lead to limited exploration efficiency and redundant
information. In this paper, we propose a novel MARL framework to obtain
adaptive and effective contextual information. Specifically, we design a
central agent that dynamically optimizes context length via temporal gradient
analysis, enhancing exploration to facilitate convergence to global optima in
MARL. Furthermore, to enhance the adaptive optimization capability of the
context length, we present an efficient input representation for the central
agent, which effectively filters redundant information. By leveraging a
Fourier-based low-frequency truncation method, we extract global temporal
trends across decentralized agents, providing an effective and efficient
representation of the MARL environment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on long-term
dependency tasks, including PettingZoo, MiniGrid, Google Research Football
(GRF), and StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge v2 (SMACv2).

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) enables simultaneous training across related tasks,
leveraging shared information to improve generalization, efficiency, and
robustness, especially in data-scarce or high-dimensional scenarios. While deep

Motivation: 现有方法采用两阶段训练潜在动作模型和世界模型，导致训练冗余且限制了二者的协同适应潜力。直接联合训练虽然概念简单但容易导致表示坍塌。

Method: 提出CoLA-World，通过关键的预热阶段有效对齐从零开始的潜在动作模型与预训练世界模型的表示，解锁协同进化循环。

Result: 在视频模拟质量和下游视觉规划任务中，CoLA-World匹配或超越了先前的两阶段方法。

Conclusion: CoLA-World为领域建立了一个稳健高效的新范式，实现了潜在动作模型与世界模型的成功联合训练。

Abstract: Adapting pre-trained video generation models into controllable world models
via latent actions is a promising step towards creating generalist world
models. The dominant paradigm adopts a two-stage approach that trains latent
action model (LAM) and the world model separately, resulting in redundant
training and limiting their potential for co-adaptation. A conceptually simple
and appealing idea is to directly replace the forward dynamic model in LAM with
a powerful world model and training them jointly, but it is non-trivial and
prone to representational collapse. In this work, we propose CoLA-World, which
for the first time successfully realizes this synergistic paradigm, resolving
the core challenge in joint learning through a critical warm-up phase that
effectively aligns the representations of the from-scratch LAM with the
pre-trained world model. This unlocks a co-evolution cycle: the world model
acts as a knowledgeable tutor, providing gradients to shape a high-quality LAM,
while the LAM offers a more precise and adaptable control interface to the
world model. Empirically, CoLA-World matches or outperforms prior two-stage
methods in both video simulation quality and downstream visual planning,
establishing a robust and efficient new paradigm for the field.

Abstract: Personalized treatment outcome prediction based on trial data for
small-sample and rare patient groups is critical in precision medicine.
However, the costly trial data limit the prediction performance. To address
this issue, we propose a cross-fidelity knowledge distillation and adaptive
fusion network (CFKD-AFN), which leverages abundant but low-fidelity simulation
data to enhance predictions on scarce but high-fidelity trial data. CFKD-AFN
incorporates a dual-channel knowledge distillation module to extract
complementary knowledge from the low-fidelity model, along with an
attention-guided fusion module to dynamically integrate multi-source
information. Experiments on treatment outcome prediction for the chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease demonstrates significant improvements of CFKD-AFN
over state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy, ranging from 6.67\% to
74.55\%, and strong robustness to varying high-fidelity dataset sizes.
Furthermore, we extend CFKD-AFN to an interpretable variant, enabling the
exploration of latent medical semantics to support clinical decision-making.

Conclusion: 通过流形约束方法可以有效提升图压缩的鲁棒性，确保在对抗攻击下仍能保持良好性能。

Abstract: Graph condensation (GC) has gained significant attention for its ability to
synthesize smaller yet informative graphs. However, existing studies often
overlook the robustness of GC in scenarios where the original graph is
corrupted. In such cases, we observe that the performance of GC deteriorates
significantly, while existing robust graph learning technologies offer only
limited effectiveness. Through both empirical investigation and theoretical
analysis, we reveal that GC is inherently an intrinsic-dimension-reducing
process, synthesizing a condensed graph with lower classification complexity.
Although this property is critical for effective GC performance, it remains
highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. To tackle this vulnerability
and improve GC robustness, we adopt the geometry perspective of graph data
manifold and propose a novel Manifold-constrained Robust Graph Condensation
framework named MRGC. Specifically, we introduce three graph data manifold
learning modules that guide the condensed graph to lie within a smooth,
low-dimensional manifold with minimal class ambiguity, thereby preserving the
classification complexity reduction capability of GC and ensuring robust
performance under universal adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the robustness of \ModelName\ across diverse attack scenarios.

Result: 在Qwen模型（3B-14B）上，ReSpec实现了最高4.5倍的加速，同时保持了奖励收敛和训练稳定性。

Conclusion: ReSpec为基于RL的LLM高效适配提供了一个实用解决方案，成功将推测解码技术适配到强化学习训练环境中。

Abstract: Adapting large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning (RL) is
often bottlenecked by the generation stage, which can consume over 75\% of the
training time. Speculative decoding (SD) accelerates autoregressive generation
in serving systems, but its behavior under RL training remains largely
unexplored. We identify three critical gaps that hinder the naive integration
of SD into RL systems: diminishing speedups at large batch sizes, drafter
staleness under continual actor updates, and drafter-induced policy
degradation.
  To address these gaps, we present ReSpec, a system that adapts SD to RL
through three complementary mechanisms: dynamically tuning SD configurations,
evolving the drafter via knowledge distillation, and weighting updates by
rollout rewards. On Qwen models (3B--14B), ReSpec achieves up to 4.5x speedup
while preserving reward convergence and training stability, providing a
practical solution for efficient RL-based LLM adaptation.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in time-series data is a critical challenge with
significant implications for network security. Recent quantum machine learning
approaches, such as quantum kernel methods and variational quantum circuits,
have shown promise in capturing complex data distributions for anomaly
detection but remain constrained by limited qubit counts. We introduce in this
work a novel Quantum Gated Recurrent Unit (QGRU)-based Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) employing Successive Data Injection (SuDaI) and a multi-metric
gating strategy for robust network anomaly detection. Our model uniquely
utilizes a quantum-enhanced generator that outputs parameters (mean and
log-variance) of a Gaussian distribution via reparameterization, combined with
a Wasserstein critic to stabilize adversarial training. Anomalies are
identified through a novel gating mechanism that initially flags potential
anomalies based on Gaussian uncertainty estimates and subsequently verifies
them using a composite of critic scores and reconstruction errors. Evaluated on
benchmark datasets, our method achieves a high time-series aware F1 score
(TaF1) of 89.43% demonstrating superior capability in detecting anomalies
accurately and promptly as compared to existing classical and quantum models.
Furthermore, the trained QGRU-WGAN was deployed on real IBM Quantum hardware,
where it retained high anomaly detection performance, confirming its robustness
and practical feasibility on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ)
devices.

Abstract: Data selection is a critical aspect of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Rewards (RLVR) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). Current data selection methods are largely heuristic-based,
lacking theoretical guarantees and generalizability. This work proposes a
theoretically-grounded approach using influence functions to estimate the
contribution of each data point to the learning objective. To overcome the
prohibitive computational cost of policy rollouts required for online influence
estimation, we introduce an off-policy influence estimation method that
efficiently approximates data influence using pre-collected offline
trajectories. Furthermore, to manage the high-dimensional gradients of LLMs, we
employ sparse random projection to reduce dimensionality and improve storage
and computation efficiency. Leveraging these techniques, we develop
\textbf{C}urriculum \textbf{R}L with \textbf{O}ff-\textbf{P}olicy
\text{I}nfluence guidance (\textbf{CROPI}), a multi-stage RL framework that
iteratively selects the most influential data for the current policy.
Experiments on models up to 7B parameters demonstrate that CROPI significantly
accelerates training. On a 1.5B model, it achieves a 2.66x step-level
acceleration while using only 10\% of the data per stage compared to
full-dataset training. Our results highlight the substantial potential of
influence-based data selection for efficient RLVR.

Abstract: Continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring via wearables offers
significant potential for early cardiovascular disease (CVD) detection.
However, deploying deep learning models for automated analysis in
resource-constrained environments faces reliability challenges due to
inevitable Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data. OOD inputs, such as unseen
pathologies or noisecorrupted signals, often cause erroneous, high-confidence
predictions by standard classifiers, compromising patient safety. Existing OOD
detection methods either neglect computational constraints or address noise and
unseen classes separately. This paper explores Unsupervised Anomaly Detection
(UAD) as an independent, upstream filtering mechanism to improve robustness. We
benchmark six UAD approaches, including Deep SVDD, reconstruction-based models,
Masked Anomaly Detection, normalizing flows, and diffusion models, optimized
via Neural Architecture Search (NAS) under strict resource constraints (at most
512k parameters). Evaluation on PTB-XL and BUT QDB datasets assessed detection
of OOD CVD classes and signals unsuitable for analysis due to noise. Results
show Deep SVDD consistently achieves the best trade-off between detection and
efficiency. In a realistic deployment simulation, integrating the optimized
Deep SVDD filter with a diagnostic classifier improved accuracy by up to 21
percentage points over a classifier-only baseline. This study demonstrates that
optimized UAD filters can safeguard automated ECG analysis, enabling safer,
more reliable continuous cardiovascular monitoring on wearables.

Conclusion: 改进表示学习是构建鲁棒世界模型的直接有效途径，无需扩大动态模块即可实现可靠的长期预测。

Abstract: A world model is an internal model that simulates how the world evolves.
Given past observations and actions, it predicts the future of both the
embodied agent and its environment. Accurate world models are essential for
enabling agents to think, plan, and reason effectively in complex, dynamic
settings. Despite rapid progress, current world models remain brittle and
degrade over long horizons. We argue that a central cause is representation
quality: exteroceptive inputs (e.g., images) are high-dimensional, and lossy or
entangled latents make dynamics learning unnecessarily hard. We therefore ask
whether improving representation learning alone can substantially improve
world-model performance. In this work, we take a step toward building a truly
accurate world model by addressing a fundamental yet open problem: constructing
a model that can fully clone and overfit to a deterministic 3D world. We
propose Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM), which enforces that
consecutive points along a natural sensory trajectory remain close in latent
representation space. This approach yields significantly improved latent
representations that align closely with the true topology of the environment.
GRWM is plug-and-play, requires only minimal architectural modification, scales
with trajectory length, and is compatible with diverse latent generative
backbones. Across deterministic 3D settings and long-horizon prediction tasks,
GRWM significantly increases rollout fidelity and stability. Analyses show that
its benefits stem from learning a latent manifold with superior geometric
structure. These findings support a clear takeaway: improving representation
learning is a direct and useful path to robust world models, delivering
reliable long-horizon predictions without enlarging the dynamics module.

Method: Convert each dataset into interpretable metadata and prompt LLMs using two strategies: zero-shot mode relying on pretrained knowledge, and meta-informed mode augmented with examples of models and their performance on past tasks.

Result: LLMs can exploit dataset metadata to recommend competitive models and hyperparameters without search across synthetic and real-world benchmarks, with improvements from meta-informed prompting demonstrating their capacity for in-context meta-learning.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise as lightweight, general-purpose assistants for model selection and hyperparameter optimization.

Abstract: Model and hyperparameter selection are critical but challenging in machine
learning, typically requiring expert intuition or expensive automated search.
We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can act as in-context
meta-learners for this task. By converting each dataset into interpretable
metadata, we prompt an LLM to recommend both model families and
hyperparameters. We study two prompting strategies: (1) a zero-shot mode
relying solely on pretrained knowledge, and (2) a meta-informed mode augmented
with examples of models and their performance on past tasks. Across synthetic
and real-world benchmarks, we show that LLMs can exploit dataset metadata to
recommend competitive models and hyperparameters without search, and that
improvements from meta-informed prompting demonstrate their capacity for
in-context meta-learning. These results highlight a promising new role for LLMs
as lightweight, general-purpose assistants for model selection and
hyperparameter optimization.

*Hsiu-Yuan Huang,Chenming Tang,Weijie Liu,Saiyong Yang,Yunfang Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了ICPO框架，利用LRMs的上下文学习能力提供专家指导，无需依赖高级模型轨迹，解决了现有RLVR方法探索受限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法如GRPO依赖当前策略分布，导致探索受限和轨迹多样性不足。虽然有些方法尝试引入专家模型轨迹，但这会增加计算成本且高级模型通常不可用。

Method: ICPO框架包含：混合策略GRPO与隐式专家引导，扩展探索范围；专家区域拒绝采样，过滤不可靠轨迹；退火专家奖励塑形，平衡早期专家指导与后期自主改进。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，ICPO持续提升了强化学习性能和训练稳定性。

Conclusion: ICPO为LRMs提供了一个可扩展且有效的RLVR范式，无需依赖高级模型即可实现更好的探索和优化稳定性。

Abstract: Existing Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods, such
as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have achieved remarkable progress
in improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs).
However, they exhibit limited exploration due to reliance on on-policy rollouts
where confined to the current policy's distribution, resulting in narrow
trajectory diversity. Recent approaches attempt to expand policy coverage by
incorporating trajectories generated from stronger expert models, yet this
reliance increases computational cost and such advaned models are often
inaccessible. To address these issues, we propose In-Context Steered Policy
Optimization (ICPO), a unified framework that leverages the inherent in-context
learning capability of LRMs to provide expert guidance using existing datasets.
ICPO introduces Mixed-Policy GRPO with Implicit Expert Forcing, which expands
exploration beyond the current policy distribution without requiring advanced
LRM trajectories. To further stabilize optimization, ICPO integrates Expert
Region Reject Sampling to filter unreliable off-policy trajectories and
Annealed Expert-Bonus Reward Shaping to balance early expert guidance with
later autonomous improvement. Results demonstrate that ICPO consistently
enhances reinforcement learning performance and training stability on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, revealing a scalable and effective RLVR
paradigm for LRMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文挑战了序列建模中参数记忆的传统关联视图，提出了几何视图，证明Transformer模型能够合成原子事实的几何结构，将复杂的推理任务简化为易于学习的几何任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上参数记忆被视为实体共现的暴力查找，作者认为这种关联视图不足以解释Transformer的实际推理能力，需要探索记忆的几何表示方式。

Method: 通过分析Transformer推理实例，发现模型必须合成原子事实的几何结构；通过分析Node2Vec连接，证明几何结构源于谱偏差的自然产生。

Result: 发现Transformer能够学习优雅的几何结构，即使这种结构不比暴力查找关联更简洁；几何视图能够简化复杂的推理任务。

Conclusion: 几何视图为参数记忆提供了新的理解框架，鼓励研究者在知识获取、容量、发现和遗忘等领域重新审视默认直觉。

Abstract: In sequence modeling, the parametric memory of atomic facts has been
predominantly abstracted as a brute-force lookup of co-occurrences between
entities. We contrast this associative view against a geometric view of how
memory is stored. We begin by isolating a clean and analyzable instance of
Transformer reasoning that is incompatible with memory as strictly a storage of
the local co-occurrences specified during training. Instead, the model must
have somehow synthesized its own geometry of atomic facts, encoding global
relationships between all entities, including non-co-occurring ones. This in
turn has simplified a hard reasoning task involving an $\ell$-fold composition
into an easy-to-learn 1-step geometric task.
  From this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding
geometries that are hard to explain. We argue that the rise of such a geometry,
despite optimizing over mere local associations, cannot be straightforwardly
attributed to typical architectural or optimizational pressures.
Counterintuitively, an elegant geometry is learned even when it is not more
succinct than a brute-force lookup of associations.
  Then, by analyzing a connection to Node2Vec, we demonstrate how the geometry
stems from a spectral bias that -- in contrast to prevailing theories -- indeed
arises naturally despite the lack of various pressures. This analysis also
points to practitioners a visible headroom to make Transformer memory more
strongly geometric. We hope the geometric view of parametric memory encourages
revisiting the default intuitions that guide researchers in areas like
knowledge acquisition, capacity, discovery and unlearning.

Motivation: 推理延迟是大语言模型大规模部署的关键瓶颈。现有的推测解码方法通常依赖双模型框架且缺乏严格的理论基础，需要更通用的多模型解决方案。

Method: 提出了多基础推测解码框架，通过理论分析揭示了多模型令牌生成中模型能力、接受长度和计算成本之间的相互作用，支持独立实现和与现有技术集成。

Result: 在多个模型系列上的实验结果显示：LLaMA2-Chat 7B加速3.31-4.01倍，LLaMA3-8B加速3.87倍，Vicuna-7B加速4.43倍，Qwen2-7B加速3.85倍，同时保持原始输出分布不变。

Conclusion: 多基础推测解码框架通过理论指导的优化，显著加速了大语言模型的推理过程，为超越传统双模型方法提供了更通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Inference latency stands as a critical bottleneck in the large-scale
deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). Speculative decoding methods have
recently shown promise in accelerating inference without compromising the
output distribution. However, existing work typically relies on a dualistic
draft-verify framework and lacks rigorous theoretical grounding. In this paper,
we introduce a novel \emph{polybasic} speculative decoding framework,
underpinned by a comprehensive theoretical analysis. Specifically, we prove a
fundamental theorem that characterizes the optimal inference time for
multi-model speculative decoding systems, shedding light on how to extend
beyond the dualistic approach to a more general polybasic paradigm. Through our
theoretical investigation of multi-model token generation, we expose and
optimize the interplay between model capabilities, acceptance lengths, and
overall computational cost. Our framework supports both standalone
implementation and integration with existing speculative techniques, leading to
accelerated performance in practice. Experimental results across multiple model
families demonstrate that our approach yields speedup ratios ranging from
$3.31\times$ to $4.01\times$ for LLaMA2-Chat 7B, up to $3.87 \times$ for
LLaMA3-8B, up to $4.43 \times$ for Vicuna-7B and up to $3.85 \times$ for
Qwen2-7B -- all while preserving the original output distribution. We release
our theoretical proofs and implementation code to facilitate further
investigation into polybasic speculative decoding.

Motivation: 虽然AI在研究型基准测试上取得快速进展，但这些进步如何转化为实际经济价值和自动化能力仍不清楚，需要建立能够衡量AI在实际工作场景中表现的基准。

Method: 引入远程劳动指数(RLI)，这是一个涵盖多个行业的基准，包含真实世界中有经济价值的项目，用于评估AI代理在实践环境中的端到端性能。

Motivation: 扩展HOHL的理论基础，证明截断版本的一致性并推导显式收敛率，验证其在非几何结构数据和主动学习中的有效性。

Method: 使用截断的高阶超图学习作为正则化器，在完全监督学习框架下进行分析，并在主动学习和非几何结构数据集上进行实证评估。

Result: 证明了截断HOHL的一致性，推导了显式收敛率，实证结果显示在主动学习和非几何结构数据中具有强大性能。

Conclusion: HOHL在不同学习场景中展现出多功能性和鲁棒性，为高阶超图学习提供了更坚实的理论基础和实证支持。

Abstract: Higher-Order Hypergraph Learning (HOHL) was recently introduced as a
principled alternative to classical hypergraph regularization, enforcing
higher-order smoothness via powers of multiscale Laplacians induced by the
hypergraph structure. Prior work established the well- and ill-posedness of
HOHL through an asymptotic consistency analysis in geometric settings. We
extend this theoretical foundation by proving the consistency of a truncated
version of HOHL and deriving explicit convergence rates when HOHL is used as a
regularizer in fully supervised learning. We further demonstrate its strong
empirical performance in active learning and in datasets lacking an underlying
geometric structure, highlighting HOHL's versatility and robustness across
diverse learning settings.

TL;DR: 研究发现，在大型语言模型的强化学习微调中，使用BF16精度会导致训练和推理策略之间的数值不匹配，而改用FP16可以有效解决这个问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决强化学习微调中的不稳定性问题，该问题源于训练和推理策略之间的数值不匹配。

Method: 将精度从BF16改为FP16，这是一个简单的代码修改，不需要改变模型架构或学习算法。

Result: 使用FP16可以获得更稳定的优化、更快的收敛速度，并在不同任务、算法和框架中表现出更强的性能。

Conclusion: FP16在强化学习微调中比BF16更优，建议重新考虑精度权衡。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) often
suffers from instability due to the numerical mismatch between the training and
inference policies. While prior work has attempted to mitigate this issue
through algorithmic corrections or engineering alignments, we show that its
root cause lies in the floating point precision itself. The widely adopted
BF16, despite its large dynamic range, introduces large rounding errors that
breaks the consistency between training and inference. In this work, we
demonstrate that simply reverting to \textbf{FP16} effectively eliminates this
mismatch. The change is simple, fully supported by modern frameworks with only
a few lines of code change, and requires no modification to the model
architecture or learning algorithm. Our results suggest that using FP16
uniformly yields more stable optimization, faster convergence, and stronger
performance across diverse tasks, algorithms and frameworks. We hope these
findings motivate a broader reconsideration of precision trade-offs in RL
fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种三阶段贝叶斯域对抗神经网络（staged B-DANN），结合参数迁移和共享潜在空间适应，用于解决工程中数据稀疏场景下的迁移学习问题，特别是在存在大域偏移时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络需要大量高质量数据，但工程实验数据往往稀疏、有噪声。传统参数迁移方法在大域偏移下性能下降，域对抗神经网络虽能改善但训练不稳定且缺乏不确定性量化能力。

Method: 三阶段框架：1）在源域训练确定性特征提取器；2）使用DANN对抗性精炼特征提取器；3）在适应后的特征提取器上构建贝叶斯神经网络，在目标域微调以处理条件偏移并提供校准的不确定性估计。

Result: 在合成基准测试中显著优于标准迁移技术，在矩形通道临界热通量预测任务中，利用管实验数据作为源域，显示出改进的预测准确性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: staged B-DANN方法能够提高预测精度和泛化能力，有望在核工程等其他领域提供帮助。

Abstract: The use of ML in engineering has grown steadily to support a wide array of
applications. Among these methods, deep neural networks have been widely
adopted due to their performance and accessibility, but they require large,
high-quality datasets. Experimental data are often sparse, noisy, or
insufficient to build resilient data-driven models. Transfer learning, which
leverages relevant data-abundant source domains to assist learning in
data-scarce target domains, has shown efficacy. Parameter transfer, where
pretrained weights are reused, is common but degrades under large domain
shifts. Domain-adversarial neural networks (DANNs) help address this issue by
learning domain-invariant representations, thereby improving transfer under
greater domain shifts in a semi-supervised setting. However, DANNs can be
unstable during training and lack a native means for uncertainty
quantification. This study introduces a fully-supervised three-stage framework,
the staged Bayesian domain-adversarial neural network (staged B-DANN), that
combines parameter transfer and shared latent space adaptation. In Stage 1, a
deterministic feature extractor is trained on the source domain. This feature
extractor is then adversarially refined using a DANN in Stage 2. In Stage 3, a
Bayesian neural network is built on the adapted feature extractor for
fine-tuning on the target domain to handle conditional shifts and yield
calibrated uncertainty estimates. This staged B-DANN approach was first
validated on a synthetic benchmark, where it was shown to significantly
outperform standard transfer techniques. It was then applied to the task of
predicting critical heat flux in rectangular channels, leveraging data from
tube experiments as the source domain. The results of this study show that the
staged B-DANN method can improve predictive accuracy and generalization,
potentially assisting other domains in nuclear engineering.

Abstract: Deploying machine learning models on compute-constrained devices has become a
key building block of modern IoT applications. In this work, we present a
compression scheme for boosted decision trees, addressing the growing need for
lightweight machine learning models. Specifically, we provide techniques for
training compact boosted decision tree ensembles that exhibit a reduced memory
footprint by rewarding, among other things, the reuse of features and
thresholds during training. Our experimental evaluation shows that models
achieved the same performance with a compression ratio of 4-16x compared to
LightGBM models using an adapted training process and an alternative memory
layout. Once deployed, the corresponding IoT devices can operate independently
of constant communication or external energy supply, and, thus, autonomously,
requiring only minimal computing power and energy. This capability opens the
door to a wide range of IoT applications, including remote monitoring, edge
analytics, and real-time decision making in isolated or power-limited

TL;DR: 本文研究了深度网络中捷径学习（shortcut learning）的层间分布特征，发现捷径学习并非集中在特定层，而是分布在整个网络中，浅层主要编码虚假特征，深层主要遗忘核心特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 捷径（虚假规则）在训练时表现良好但泛化能力差，是深度网络可靠性的主要挑战。然而，捷径对特征表示的影响研究不足，阻碍了设计原则性捷径缓解方法。

Method: 提出新颖的实验设计，通过对比在干净数据集和偏斜数据集上的反事实训练，量化由捷径诱导偏斜导致的层间准确率退化贡献。在CIFAR-10、Waterbirds和CelebA数据集上，使用VGG、ResNet、DeiT和ConvNeXt架构进行研究。

Result: 发现捷径学习不是局部化在特定层，而是分布在整个网络中。浅层主要编码虚假特征，深层主要遗忘在干净数据上具有预测性的核心特征。分析了定位差异及其主要变化轴。

Conclusion: 层间捷径缓解策略的分析表明设计通用方法很困难，支持采用数据集和架构特定的方法。

Abstract: Shortcuts, spurious rules that perform well during training but fail to
generalize, present a major challenge to the reliability of deep networks
(Geirhos et al., 2020). However, the impact of shortcuts on feature
representations remains understudied, obstructing the design of principled
shortcut-mitigation methods. To overcome this limitation, we investigate the
layer-wise localization of shortcuts in deep models. Our novel experiment
design quantifies the layer-wise contribution to accuracy degradation caused by
a shortcut-inducing skew by counterfactual training on clean and skewed
datasets. We employ our design to study shortcuts on CIFAR-10, Waterbirds, and
CelebA datasets across VGG, ResNet, DeiT, and ConvNeXt architectures. We find
that shortcut learning is not localized in specific layers but distributed
throughout the network. Different network parts play different roles in this
process: shallow layers predominantly encode spurious features, while deeper
layers predominantly forget core features that are predictive on clean data. We
also analyze the differences in localization and describe its principal axes of
variation. Finally, our analysis of layer-wise shortcut-mitigation strategies
suggests the hardness of designing general methods, supporting dataset- and
architecture-specific approaches instead.

Conclusion: 局部校准方法能够有效解决多分类校准中的邻近偏差问题，特别适用于高风险决策场景。

Abstract: Developing trustworthy Machine Learning (ML) models requires their predicted
probabilities to be well-calibrated, meaning they should reflect true-class
frequencies. Among calibration notions in multiclass classification, strong
calibration is the most stringent, as it requires all predicted probabilities
to be simultaneously calibrated across all classes. However, existing
approaches to multiclass calibration lack a notion of distance among inputs,
which makes them vulnerable to proximity bias: predictions in sparse regions of
the feature space are systematically miscalibrated. This is especially relevant
in high-stakes settings, such as healthcare, where the sparse instances are
exactly those most at risk of biased treatment. In this work, we address this
main shortcoming by introducing a local perspective on multiclass calibration.
First, we formally define multiclass local calibration and establish its
relationship with strong calibration. Second, we theoretically analyze the
pitfalls of existing evaluation metrics when applied to multiclass local
calibration. Third, we propose a practical method for enhancing local
calibration in Neural Networks, which enforces alignment between predicted
probabilities and local estimates of class frequencies using the Jensen-Shannon
distance. Finally, we empirically validate our approach against existing
multiclass calibration techniques.

Conclusion: 该方法在几何精度、计算实用性和可解释性之间取得了平衡，未来可扩展到非高斯分布、应用熵正则化加速计算，以及适应高维数据近似更复杂结构。

Abstract: This paper considers the problem of regression over distributions, which is
becoming increasingly important in machine learning. Existing approaches often
ignore the geometry of the probability space or are computationally expensive.
To overcome these limitations, a new method is proposed that combines the
parameterization of probability trajectories using a Bernstein basis and the
minimization of the Wasserstein distance between distributions. The key idea is
to model a conditional distribution as a smooth probability trajectory defined
by a weighted sum of Gaussian components whose parameters -- the mean and
covariance -- are functions of the input variable constructed using Bernstein
polynomials. The loss function is the averaged squared Wasserstein distance
between the predicted Gaussian distributions and the empirical data, which
takes into account the geometry of the distributions. An autodiff-based
optimization method is used to train the model. Experiments on synthetic
datasets that include complex trajectories demonstrated that the proposed
method provides competitive approximation quality in terms of the Wasserstein
distance, Energy Distance, and RMSE metrics, especially in cases of pronounced
nonlinearity. The model demonstrates trajectory smoothness that is better than
or comparable to alternatives and robustness to changes in data structure,
while maintaining high interpretability due to explicit parameterization via
control points. The developed approach represents a balanced solution that
combines geometric accuracy, computational practicality, and interpretability.
Prospects for further research include extending the method to non-Gaussian
distributions, applying entropy regularization to speed up computations, and
adapting the approach to working with high-dimensional data for approximating
surfaces and more complex structures.

Abstract: We introduce Aeolus, a large-scale Multi-modal Flight Delay Dataset designed
to advance research on flight delay prediction and support the development of
foundation models for tabular data. Existing datasets in this domain are
typically limited to flat tabular structures and fail to capture the
spatiotemporal dynamics inherent in delay propagation. Aeolus addresses this
limitation by providing three aligned modalities: (i) a tabular dataset with
rich operational, meteorological, and airportlevel features for over 50 million
flights; (ii) a flight chain module that models delay propagation along
sequential flight legs, capturing upstream and downstream dependencies; and
(iii) a flight network graph that encodes shared aircraft, crew, and airport
resource connections, enabling cross-flight relational reasoning. The dataset
is carefully constructed with temporal splits, comprehensive features, and
strict leakage prevention to support realistic and reproducible machine
learning evaluation. Aeolus supports a broad range of tasks, including
regression, classification, temporal structure modeling, and graph learning,
serving as a unified benchmark across tabular, sequential, and graph
modalities. We release baseline experiments and preprocessing tools to
facilitate adoption. Aeolus fills a key gap for both domain-specific modeling
and general-purpose structured data research.Our source code and data can be

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) has the potential to solve various combinatorial
tasks, ranging from materials science to neural architecture search. However,
BO requires specialized kernels to effectively model combinatorial domains.
Recent efforts have introduced several combinatorial kernels, but the
relationships among them are not well understood. To bridge this gap, we
develop a unifying framework based on heat kernels, which we derive in a
systematic way and express as simple closed-form expressions. Using this
framework, we prove that many successful combinatorial kernels are either
related or equivalent to heat kernels, and validate this theoretical claim in
our experiments. Moreover, our analysis confirms and extends the results
presented in Bounce: certain algorithms' performance decreases substantially
when the unknown optima of the function do not have a certain structure. In
contrast, heat kernels are not sensitive to the location of the optima. Lastly,
we show that a fast and simple pipeline, relying on heat kernels, is able to
achieve state-of-the-art results, matching or even outperforming certain slow

TL;DR: 本文研究了时间序列分类方法作为异常检测模型选择的性能，通过评估234种模型配置和1980多个时间序列，证明模型选择方法优于任何单一异常检测方法，且执行时间在同一数量级。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于在异构时间序列数据集上不存在通用的最佳异常检测方法，需要基于时间序列特征选择最佳检测方法的模型选择方法。现有的AutoML解决方案不直接适用于时间序列异常检测，且缺乏基于时间序列的模型选择方法评估。

Method: 使用16个基础分类器生成234种模型配置，在1980多个时间序列上进行评估，研究时间序列分类方法作为异常检测模型选择的性能。

Result: 模型选择方法在性能上优于所有单一异常检测方法，同时执行时间保持在同一数量级。

Conclusion: 这是首次证明时间序列分类算法在异常检测中准确性和效率的评估，为通用AutoML管道中的模型选择步骤提供了强基线。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a fundamental task for time series analytics with
important implications for the downstream performance of many applications.
Despite increasing academic interest and the large number of methods proposed
in the literature, recent benchmarks and evaluation studies demonstrated that
no overall best anomaly detection methods exist when applied to very
heterogeneous time series datasets. Therefore, the only scalable and viable
solution to solve anomaly detection over very different time series collected
from diverse domains is to propose a model selection method that will select,
based on time series characteristics, the best anomaly detection methods to
run. Existing AutoML solutions are, unfortunately, not directly applicable to
time series anomaly detection, and no evaluation of time series-based
approaches for model selection exists. Towards that direction, this paper
studies the performance of time series classification methods used as model
selection for anomaly detection. In total, we evaluate 234 model configurations
derived from 16 base classifiers across more than 1980 time series, and we
propose the first extensive experimental evaluation of time series
classification as model selection for anomaly detection. Our results
demonstrate that model selection methods outperform every single anomaly
detection method while being in the same order of magnitude regarding execution
time. This evaluation is the first step to demonstrate the accuracy and
efficiency of time series classification algorithms for anomaly detection, and
represents a strong baseline that can then be used to guide the model selection
step in general AutoML pipelines. Preprint version of an article accepted at

TL;DR: 提出Curly-FM方法，通过设计具有非零漂移参考过程的Schrödinger桥问题，能够学习非梯度场动力学，解决了现有方法无法捕捉周期性行为的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多现实系统（如单细胞RNA中的细胞周期）表现出非梯度、周期性行为，而现有基于最小作用原理的方法只能捕捉梯度场动力学，无法建模这类系统。

Method: 设计并求解具有非零漂移参考过程的Schrödinger桥问题，利用推断的速度和群体快照数据构建参考过程，从而学习非梯度场动力学。

Result: 在单细胞、计算流体动力学和洋流等轨迹推断问题上验证了Curly-FM的有效性，证明其学习的轨迹能更好地匹配参考过程和群体边际分布。

Conclusion: Curly-FM扩展了流匹配模型的能力，使其能够建模物理系统中已知的周期性行为，超越了仅对群体建模的限制。

Abstract: Modeling the transport dynamics of natural processes from population-level
observations is a ubiquitous problem in the natural sciences. Such models rely
on key assumptions about the underlying process in order to enable faithful
learning of governing dynamics that mimic the actual system behavior. The de
facto assumption in current approaches relies on the principle of least action
that results in gradient field dynamics and leads to trajectories minimizing an
energy functional between two probability measures. However, many real-world
systems, such as cell cycles in single-cell RNA, are known to exhibit
non-gradient, periodic behavior, which fundamentally cannot be captured by
current state-of-the-art methods such as flow and bridge matching. In this
paper, we introduce Curly Flow Matching (Curly-FM), a novel approach that is
capable of learning non-gradient field dynamics by designing and solving a
Schr\"odinger bridge problem with a non-zero drift reference process -- in
stark contrast to typical zero-drift reference processes -- which is
constructed using inferred velocities in addition to population snapshot data.
We showcase Curly-FM by solving the trajectory inference problems for single
cells, computational fluid dynamics, and ocean currents with approximate
velocities. We demonstrate that Curly-FM can learn trajectories that better
match both the reference process and population marginals. Curly-FM expands
flow matching models beyond the modeling of populations and towards the
modeling of known periodic behavior in physical systems. Our code repository is

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于奇异值分解和标准扰动机制的简单高效差分隐私算法，用于计算矩阵前r个奇异向量张成的子空间，其误差仅依赖于秩r相干性和谱间隙，解决了Hardt和Roth提出的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在差分隐私下计算矩阵前r个奇异向量张成子空间的问题，改进现有方法的性能，特别是在密集设置下达到与非私有最优算法相同的保证。

Method: 使用奇异值分解和标准扰动机制，基于高斯机制构建私有秩r近似估计器，并证明秩r相干性在高斯扰动下不会增加。

Result: 该算法在密集设置下对Wishart模型中的单峰PCA达到了与非私有最优算法相同的保证，而之前的私有算法未能做到。同时证明了相干性在高斯扰动下保持不变。

Conclusion: 提出的简单高效算法在差分隐私下实现了最优性能，相干性概念在私有算法设计中具有重要作用，并可以扩展到图问题等其他结构化模型。

Abstract: We revisit the task of computing the span of the top $r$ singular vectors
$u_1, \ldots, u_r$ of a matrix under differential privacy. We show that a
simple and efficient algorithm -- based on singular value decomposition and
standard perturbation mechanisms -- returns a private rank-$r$ approximation
whose error depends only on the \emph{rank-$r$ coherence} of $u_1, \ldots, u_r$
and the spectral gap $\sigma_r - \sigma_{r+1}$. This resolves a question posed
by Hardt and Roth~\cite{hardt2013beyond}. Our estimator outperforms the state
of the art -- significantly so in some regimes. In particular, we show that in
the dense setting, it achieves the same guarantees for single-spike PCA in the
Wishart model as those attained by optimal non-private algorithms, whereas
prior private algorithms failed to do so.
  In addition, we prove that (rank-$r$) coherence does not increase under
Gaussian perturbations. This implies that any estimator based on the Gaussian
mechanism -- including ours -- preserves the coherence of the input. We
conjecture that similar behavior holds for other structured models, including
planted problems in graphs.
  We also explore applications of coherence to graph problems. In particular,
we present a differentially private algorithm for Max-Cut and other constraint
satisfaction problems under low coherence assumptions.

TL;DR: LoRAQuant是一种针对LoRA适配器的混合精度后训练量化方法，通过SVD重参数化将重要信息集中在特定行列，从而对重要部分使用高精度量化，其余部分使用超低位宽量化，显著降低存储成本同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA适配器在同时加载多个时会带来显著的聚合成本，需要一种高效的量化方法来减少存储开销。

Method: 使用奇异值分解(SVD)对每个适配器进行重参数化，将重要信息集中在特定行列，然后对重要组件使用高精度量化，其余部分使用超低位宽量化。

Result: 在LLaMA 2-7B、LLaMA 2-13B和Mistral 7B模型上的数学推理、编程和摘要任务实验表明，LoRAQuant使用显著更低的比特数，但达到可比甚至更高的性能。

Conclusion: LoRAQuant能够显著降低LoRA适配器的存储成本，同时保持或提升模型性能，为大规模部署多个适配器提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a popular technique for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). In many
real-world scenarios, multiple adapters are loaded simultaneously to enable LLM
customization for personalized user experiences or to support a diverse range
of tasks. Although each adapter is lightweight in isolation, their aggregate
cost becomes substantial at scale. To address this, we propose LoRAQuant, a
mixed-precision post-training quantization method tailored to LoRA.
Specifically, LoRAQuant reparameterizes each adapter by singular value
decomposition (SVD) to concentrate the most important information into specific
rows and columns. This makes it possible to quantize the important components
to higher precision, while quantizing the rest to ultra-low bitwidth. We
conduct comprehensive experiments with LLaMA 2-7B, LLaMA 2-13B, and Mistral 7B
models on mathematical reasoning, coding, and summarization tasks. Results show
that our LoRAQuant uses significantly lower bits than other quantization
methods, but achieves comparable or even higher performance.

Conclusion: 通过特定的正则化项设计，可逆神经网络能够在反演时恢复经典贝叶斯点估计器的特性，为逆问题提供了稳定且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Can regularization terms in the training of invertible neural networks lead
to known Bayesian point estimators in reconstruction? Invertible networks are
attractive for inverse problems due to their inherent stability and
interpretability. Recently, optimization strategies for invertible neural
networks that approximate either a reconstruction map or the forward operator
have been studied from a Bayesian perspective, but each has limitations. To
address this, we introduce and analyze two regularization terms for the network
training that, upon inversion of the network, recover properties of classical
Bayesian point estimators: while the first can be connected to the posterior
mean, the second resembles the MAP estimator. Our theoretical analysis
characterizes how each loss shapes both the learned forward operator and its
inverse reconstruction map. Numerical experiments support our findings and
demonstrate how these loss-term regularizers introduce data-dependence in a
stable and interpretable way.

Motivation: 标准延迟算法训练需要为每个训练样本查询所有专家，当专家查询成本高昂时变得不可行，这违背了延迟的核心目标

Method: 提出新的两阶段和单阶段多专家延迟算法，在训练时仅选择性地查询部分专家，平衡成本与性能

Result: 理论分析提供了泛化边界和标签复杂度保证，多个领域的实证结果显示算法显著降低训练成本而不牺牲预测精度

Conclusion: 预算感知延迟算法具有实际价值，能在不损害性能的前提下大幅减少训练阶段的专家查询成本

Abstract: Learning to defer uncertain predictions to costly experts offers a powerful
strategy for improving the accuracy and efficiency of machine learning systems.
However, standard training procedures for deferral algorithms typically require
querying all experts for every training instance, an approach that becomes
prohibitively expensive when expert queries incur significant computational or
resource costs. This undermines the core goal of deferral: to limit unnecessary
expert usage. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the budgeted deferral
framework, which aims to train effective deferral algorithms while minimizing
expert query costs during training. We propose new algorithms for both
two-stage and single-stage multiple-expert deferral settings that selectively
query only a subset of experts per training example. While inspired by active
learning, our setting is fundamentally different: labels are already known, and
the core challenge is to decide which experts to query in order to balance cost
and predictive performance. We establish theoretical guarantees for both of our
algorithms, including generalization bounds and label complexity analyses.
Empirical results across several domains show that our algorithms substantially
reduce training costs without sacrificing prediction accuracy, demonstrating
the practical value of our budget-aware deferral algorithms.

TL;DR: 提出ARC-Top-K压缩器，通过轻量级梯度草图对齐节点间的稀疏模式，实现无需索引的All-Reduce操作，同时保留全局重要信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模分布式机器学习中的通信瓶颈问题。现有梯度压缩方法存在局限：Rand-K丢弃结构信息且实际性能差，Top-K保留重要条目但失去收缩属性且需要昂贵的All-Gather操作。

Method: 设计All-Reduce兼容的Top-K压缩器，使用轻量级梯度草图对齐跨节点稀疏模式，结合动量误差反馈(EF21M)算法。

Result: ARC-Top-K在理论上具有收缩性，与EF21M结合时实现线性加速和更快的收敛速度。实验显示其精度与Top-K相当，同时将训练时间减少高达60.7%。

Conclusion: ARC-Top-K提供了一种高效可扩展的解决方案，结合了Rand-K的鲁棒性和Top-K的强性能。

Abstract: Communication remains a central bottleneck in large-scale distributed machine
learning, and gradient sparsification has emerged as a promising strategy to
alleviate this challenge. However, existing gradient compressors face notable
limitations: Rand-$K$\ discards structural information and performs poorly in
practice, while Top-$K$\ preserves informative entries but loses the
contraction property and requires costly All-Gather operations. In this paper,
we propose ARC-Top-$K$, an {All-Reduce}-Compatible Top-$K$ compressor that
aligns sparsity patterns across nodes using a lightweight sketch of the
gradient, enabling index-free All-Reduce while preserving globally significant
information. ARC-Top-$K$\ is provably contractive and, when combined with
momentum error feedback (EF21M), achieves linear speedup and sharper
convergence rates than the original EF21M under standard assumptions.
Empirically, ARC-Top-$K$\ matches the accuracy of Top-$K$\ while reducing
wall-clock training time by up to 60.7\%, offering an efficient and scalable
solution that combines the robustness of Rand-$K$\ with the strong performance
of Top-$K$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器遗忘旨在避免昂贵重训练来移除特定数据点的影响，但大多数实用算法是近似的，只能通过实证评估性能。当前常见的从同一训练模型多次独立运行的做法可能产生非代表性结果。

Method: 通过分析机器遗忘算法对模型训练随机种子的敏感性，比较了不同训练种子下算法性能的变异性。

Result: 发现某些机器遗忘方法对训练种子的选择高度敏感，即使对于相同架构和数据集，不同训练种子会导致显著不同的遗忘效果。

Conclusion: 建议机器遗忘算法的实证比较应该反映不同模型训练种子间的变异性，而不仅仅是从同一训练模型多次运行。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of certain data points
from a trained model without costly retraining. Most practical MU algorithms
are only approximate and their performance can only be assessed empirically.
Care must therefore be taken to make empirical comparisons as representative as
possible. A common practice is to run the MU algorithm multiple times
independently starting from the same trained model. In this work, we
demonstrate that this practice can give highly non-representative results
because -- even for the same architecture and same dataset -- some MU methods
can be highly sensitive to the choice of random number seed used for model
training. We therefore recommend that empirical
comphttps://info.arxiv.org/help/prep#commentsarisons of MU algorithms should
also reflect the variability across different model training seeds.

Conclusion: 该机制是第一个在纯差分隐私下实现谱范数最优误差的协方差估计器，在不同数据集规模下均提供最优或改进的误差保证。

Abstract: We present a simple perturbation mechanism for the release of $d$-dimensional
covariance matrices $\Sigma$ under pure differential privacy. For large
datasets with at least $n\geq d^2/\varepsilon$ elements, our mechanism recovers
the provably optimal Frobenius norm error guarantees of
\cite{nikolov2023private}, while simultaneously achieving best known error for
all other $p$-Schatten norms, with $p\in [1,\infty]$. Our error is
information-theoretically optimal for all $p\ge 2$, in particular, our
mechanism is the first purely private covariance estimator that achieves
optimal error in spectral norm.
  For small datasets $n< d^2/\varepsilon$, we further show that by projecting
the output onto the nuclear norm ball of appropriate radius, our algorithm
achieves the optimal Frobenius norm error $O(\sqrt{d\;\text{Tr}(\Sigma) /n})$,
improving over the known bounds of $O(\sqrt{d/n})$ of \cite{nikolov2023private}

Motivation: 现有OTA-FL设计在异构无线场景下受限于最弱设备，导致更新方差膨胀，且先前分析主要针对凸目标函数，而现代AI模型多为高度非凸。

Method: 开发了允许时间不变模型偏差的OTA-FL SGD更新方法，提出了基于统计CSI的非凸联合功率控制设计，并采用逐次凸逼近算法进行优化。

Result: 在非凸图像分类任务上的实验表明，基于SCA的设计通过优化偏差加速了收敛，并优于先前的OTA-FL基线方法。

Conclusion: 在异构无线条件下，允许结构化偏差的OTA-FL SGD方法能够有效优化偏差-方差权衡，提升联邦学习性能。

Abstract: Over-the-air (OTA) federated learning (FL) has been well recognized as a
scalable paradigm that exploits the waveform superposition of the wireless
multiple-access channel to aggregate model updates in a single use. Existing
OTA-FL designs largely enforce zero-bias model updates by either assuming
\emph{homogeneous} wireless conditions (equal path loss across devices) or
forcing zero-bias updates to guarantee convergence. Under \emph{heterogeneous}
wireless scenarios, however, such designs are constrained by the weakest device
and inflate the update variance. Moreover, prior analyses of biased OTA-FL
largely address convex objectives, while most modern AI models are highly
non-convex. Motivated by these gaps, we study OTA-FL with stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) for general smooth non-convex objectives under wireless
heterogeneity. We develop novel OTA-FL SGD updates that allow a structured,
time-invariant model bias while facilitating reduced variance updates. We
derive a finite-time stationarity bound (expected time average squared gradient
norm) that explicitly reveals a bias-variance trade-off. To optimize this
trade-off, we pose a non-convex joint OTA power-control design and develop an
efficient successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that requires only
statistical CSI at the base station. Experiments on a non-convex image
classification task validate the approach: the SCA-based design accelerates
convergence via an optimized bias and improves generalization over prior OTA-FL
baselines.

Conclusion: STaMP量化策略有效解决了低比特激活量化时的准确率下降问题，为生成式AI模型的高效部署提供了新方案

Abstract: Quantization is the key method for reducing inference latency, power and
memory footprint of generative AI models. However, accuracy often degrades
sharply when activations are quantized below eight bits. Recent work suggests
that invertible linear transformations (e.g. rotations) can aid quantization,
by reparameterizing feature channels and weights. In this paper, we propose
\textit{Sequence Transformation and Mixed Precision} (STaMP) quantization, a
novel strategy that applies linear transformations along the \textit{sequence}
dimension to exploit the strong local correlation in language and visual data.
By keeping a small number of tokens in each intermediate activation at higher
precision, we can maintain model accuracy at lower (average) activations
bit-widths. We evaluate STaMP on recent LVM and LLM architectures,
demonstrating that it significantly improves low bit width activation
quantization and complements established activation and weight quantization
methods including recent feature transformations.

Conclusion: 提出的基于特征和logits的采样技术能够有效改进影响函数的估计，在显著减少计算资源的同时保持或提高了估计准确性。

Abstract: How can we explain the influence of training data on black-box models?
Influence functions (IFs) offer a post-hoc solution by utilizing gradients and
Hessians. However, computing the Hessian for an entire dataset is
resource-intensive, necessitating a feasible alternative. A common approach
involves randomly sampling a small subset of the training data, but this method
often results in highly inconsistent IF estimates due to the high variance in
sample configurations. To address this, we propose two advanced sampling
techniques based on features and logits. These samplers select a small yet
representative subset of the entire dataset by considering the stochastic
distribution of features or logits, thereby enhancing the accuracy of IF
estimations. We validate our approach through class removal experiments, a
typical application of IFs, using the F1-score to measure how effectively the
model forgets the removed class while maintaining inference consistency on the
remaining classes. Our method reduces computation time by 30.1% and memory
usage by 42.2%, or improves the F1-score by 2.5% compared to the baseline.

Abstract: Recent research on time series foundation models has primarily focused on
forecasting, leaving it unclear how generalizable their learned representations
are. In this study, we examine whether frozen pre-trained forecasting models

compare different representation extraction strategies and introduce two
model-agnostic embedding augmentations. Our experiments show that the best
forecasting models achieve classification accuracy that matches or even
surpasses that of state-of-the-art models pre-trained specifically for
classification. Moreover, we observe a positive correlation between forecasting
and classification performance. These findings challenge the assumption that
task-specific pre-training is necessary, and suggest that learning to forecast
may provide a powerful route toward constructing general-purpose time series
foundation models.

Result: 模型能够成功预测未见过的PCG序列，即使输出截断到单个比特；发现缩放定律：上下文序列元素数量需求随√m增长；对于大模数需要课程学习；发现嵌入层出现比特旋转不变性聚类现象。

Conclusion: Transformer能够学习复杂的PCG序列，揭示了模型通过比特旋转不变性聚类实现表示迁移的机制，为理解神经网络学习伪随机模式提供了新见解。

Abstract: We study the ability of Transformer models to learn sequences generated by
Permuted Congruential Generators (PCGs), a widely used family of pseudo-random
number generators (PRNGs). PCGs introduce substantial additional difficulty
over linear congruential generators (LCGs) by applying a series of bit-wise
shifts, XORs, rotations and truncations to the hidden state. We show that
Transformers can nevertheless successfully perform in-context prediction on
unseen sequences from diverse PCG variants, in tasks that are beyond published
classical attacks. In our experiments we scale moduli up to $2^{22}$ using up
to $50$ million model parameters and datasets with up to $5$ billion tokens.
Surprisingly, we find even when the output is truncated to a single bit, it can
be reliably predicted by the model. When multiple distinct PRNGs are presented
together during training, the model can jointly learn them, identifying
structures from different permutations. We demonstrate a scaling law with
modulus $m$: the number of in-context sequence elements required for
near-perfect prediction grows as $\sqrt{m}$. For larger moduli, optimization
enters extended stagnation phases; in our experiments, learning moduli $m \geq
2^{20}$ requires incorporating training data from smaller moduli, demonstrating
a critical necessity for curriculum learning. Finally, we analyze embedding
layers and uncover a novel clustering phenomenon: the model spontaneously
groups the integer inputs into bitwise rotationally-invariant clusters,
revealing how representations can transfer from smaller to larger moduli.

### [230] [StructLayoutFormer:Conditional Structured Layout Generation via Structure Serialization and Disentanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26141)
*Xin Hu,Pengfei Xu,Jin Zhou,Hongbo Fu,Hui Huang*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: StructLayoutFormer是一个基于Transformer的条件结构化布局生成方法，通过结构序列化表示布局，将结构信息与元素位置解耦，首次实现了数据驱动的条件结构化布局生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动方法能自动生成固定布局但无法产生布局结构，而结构化布局在2D视觉内容中更受欢迎，因为结构信息便于布局编辑。

Method: 使用结构序列化方案将结构化布局表示为序列，将结构信息与元素位置解耦，采用Transformer架构进行条件生成。

Result: 在条件结构化布局生成任务中超越了现有基线方法，并能有效提取和传输布局结构。

Conclusion: 该方法首次实现了数据驱动的条件结构化布局生成，能产生明确的现实布局结构，在布局生成和结构传输方面表现优异。

Abstract: Structured layouts are preferable in many 2D visual contents (\eg, GUIs,
webpages) since the structural information allows convenient layout editing.
Computational frameworks can help create structured layouts but require heavy
labor input. Existing data-driven approaches are effective in automatically
generating fixed layouts but fail to produce layout structures. We present
StructLayoutFormer, a novel Transformer-based approach for conditional
structured layout generation. We use a structure serialization scheme to
represent structured layouts as sequences. To better control the structures of
generated layouts, we disentangle the structural information from the element
placements. Our approach is the first data-driven approach that achieves
conditional structured layout generation and produces realistic layout
structures explicitly. We compare our approach with existing data-driven layout
generation approaches by including post-processing for structure extraction.
Extensive experiments have shown that our approach exceeds these baselines in
conditional structured layout generation. We also demonstrate that our approach
is effective in extracting and transferring layout structures. The code is

### [231] [Towards Piece-by-Piece Explanations for Chess Positions with SHAP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25775)
*Francesco Spinnato*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 将SHAP解释性AI技术应用于国际象棋分析，通过系统性地移除棋子来计算每个棋子对引擎评估的贡献度，提供可解释的棋子级分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统国际象棋引擎提供精确但不透明的评估分数（百分兵值），这些输出掩盖了单个棋子或模式的贡献。需要一种能够解释引擎评估背后具体棋子贡献的方法。

Method: 将棋子视为特征，通过系统性地移除棋子来计算SHAP值，获得每个棋子的加性贡献，从而以局部忠实且人类可解释的方式解释引擎输出。

Result: 开发了一种能够将国际象棋引擎评估归因于特定棋子的方法，该方法受到古典国际象棋教学法的启发，并将其与现代可解释AI技术相结合。

Conclusion: 该方法为可视化、人类训练和引擎比较开辟了新的可能性，并发布了配套代码和数据以促进可解释国际象棋AI的未来研究。

Abstract: Contemporary chess engines offer precise yet opaque evaluations, typically
expressed as centipawn scores. While effective for decision-making, these
outputs obscure the underlying contributions of individual pieces or patterns.
In this paper, we explore adapting SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to the
domain of chess analysis, aiming to attribute a chess engines evaluation to
specific pieces on the board. By treating pieces as features and systematically
ablating them, we compute additive, per-piece contributions that explain the
engines output in a locally faithful and human-interpretable manner. This
method draws inspiration from classical chess pedagogy, where players assess
positions by mentally removing pieces, and grounds it in modern explainable AI
techniques. Our approach opens new possibilities for visualization, human
training, and engine comparison. We release accompanying code and data to
foster future research in interpretable chess AI.

TL;DR: 提出了一个面向工业5.0的新框架，简化AI模型在边缘设备上的部署，通过本地推理和实时处理降低延迟，避免外部数据传输。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决工业环境中AI模型部署复杂、延迟高的问题，实现更高效的边缘计算应用。

Method: 采用基于代理的架构，支持人类、算法或协作代理执行明确定义的任务，支持模块化集成并保持低资源需求。

latency and avoids external data transfer by enabling local inference and
real-time processing. Our implementation is agent-based, which means that
individual agents, whether human, algorithmic, or collaborative, are

### [233] [Symbolically Scaffolded Play: Designing Role-Sensitive Prompts for Generative NPC Dialogue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25820)
*Vanessa Figueiredo,David Elumeze*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究探讨了在基于GPT-4o的侦探游戏《The Interview》中，高约束提示是否能改善玩家体验。研究发现约束提示的效果取决于NPC角色类型，推翻了"更紧约束必然提升游戏体验"的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型承诺通过非玩家角色实现非脚本对话来改变互动游戏，但尚不清楚约束提示是否真正改善玩家体验。

Method: 通过用户可用性研究比较高低约束提示，然后重新设计为混合JSON+RAG框架，并使用LLM法官进行合成评估。

Result: 研究发现约束效果具有角色依赖性：提问者NPC获得稳定性，而嫌疑犯NPC失去即兴可信度。没有可靠体验差异，除了对技术故障的敏感性。

Conclusion: 提出了符号化支撑游戏框架，将符号结构表达为模糊数值边界，在需要稳定性的地方保持连贯性，在需要惊喜的地方保留即兴性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) promise to transform interactive games by
enabling non-player characters (NPCs) to sustain unscripted dialogue. Yet it
remains unclear whether constrained prompts actually improve player experience.
We investigate this question through The Interview, a voice-based detective
game powered by GPT-4o. A within-subjects usability study ($N=10$) compared
high-constraint (HCP) and low-constraint (LCP) prompts, revealing no reliable
experiential differences beyond sensitivity to technical breakdowns. Guided by
these findings, we redesigned the HCP into a hybrid JSON+RAG scaffold and
conducted a synthetic evaluation with an LLM judge, positioned as an
early-stage complement to usability testing. Results uncovered a novel pattern:
scaffolding effects were role-dependent: the Interviewer (quest-giver NPC)
gained stability, while suspect NPCs lost improvisational believability. These
findings overturn the assumption that tighter constraints inherently enhance
play. Extending fuzzy-symbolic scaffolding, we introduce \textit{Symbolically
Scaffolded Play}, a framework in which symbolic structures are expressed as
fuzzy, numerical boundaries that stabilize coherence where needed while
preserving improvisation where surprise sustains engagement.

*Xingjian Zhang,Tianhong Gao,Suliang Jin,Tianhao Wang,Teng Ye,Eytan Adar,Qiaozhu Mei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出人-LLM协作框架，通过拒绝采样方法从仅标签注释中推断思维轨迹，用于微调开源LLM评估器和改进专有LLM评估器的标注指南，显著提高LLM与人类评估的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM作为评估器的可靠性在主观任务中有限，因为人类判断涉及超出标注标签的细微推理。思维轨迹（判断背后的推理）信息丰富但难以收集和整理。

Method: 使用简单有效的拒绝采样方法重构思维轨迹，应用于两个互补任务：微调开源LLM评估器和为专有LLM评估器合成更清晰的标注指南。

Result: 在多个数据集上，该方法显著提高了LLM与人类评估的一致性，改进的标注指南也增加了不同LLM模型之间的一致性。

Conclusion: LLM可以作为未揭示的人类思维轨迹的实用代理，使仅标签语料库能够扩展为思维轨迹增强资源，从而提高LLM评估器的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as raters for evaluation
tasks. However, their reliability is often limited for subjective tasks, when
human judgments involve subtle reasoning beyond annotation labels. Thinking
traces, the reasoning behind a judgment, are highly informative but challenging
to collect and curate. We present a human-LLM collaborative framework to infer
thinking traces from label-only annotations. The proposed framework uses a
simple and effective rejection sampling method to reconstruct these traces at
scale. These inferred thinking traces are applied to two complementary tasks:
(1) fine-tuning open LLM raters; and (2) synthesizing clearer annotation
guidelines for proprietary LLM raters. Across multiple datasets, our methods
lead to significantly improved LLM-human agreement. Additionally, the refined
annotation guidelines increase agreement among different LLM models. These
results suggest that LLMs can serve as practical proxies for otherwise
unrevealed human thinking traces, enabling label-only corpora to be extended
into thinking-trace-augmented resources that enhance the reliability of LLM
raters.

*Christian Dittrich,Jennifer Flygare Kinne*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个两层次框架来解释为什么压缩过程会强制发现因果结构而非表面统计模式。信息论必要性(ITI)从进化角度解释生存压力如何导致预测压缩需求，压缩效率原则(CEP)则说明高效压缩如何通过异常积累动态选择生成性因果模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有框架虽然认识到压缩对智能的核心作用，但未能具体解释为什么这个过程会强制发现因果结构而非表面统计模式。

Method: 引入两层次框架：ITI建立生存压力与信息处理需求之间的联系，CEP通过异常积累动态说明高效压缩如何选择生成性因果模型。

Result: 该框架产生了可经验验证的预测：压缩效率与分布外泛化相关，异常积累率可区分因果模型与相关模型，分层系统在不同抽象层上表现出递增效率，生物系统的代谢成本与表征复杂性相关。

Conclusion: ITI和CEP提供了一个统一解释，涵盖生物、人工和多尺度系统的收敛现象，解决了智能的认知和功能维度，无需诉诸意识或主观经验假设。

Abstract: Existing frameworks converge on the centrality of compression to intelligence
but leave underspecified why this process enforces the discovery of causal
structure rather than superficial statistical patterns. We introduce a
two-level framework to address this gap. The Information-Theoretic Imperative
(ITI) establishes that any system persisting in uncertain environments must
minimize epistemic entropy through predictive compression: this is the
evolutionary "why" linking survival pressure to information-processing demands.
The Compression Efficiency Principle (CEP) specifies how efficient compression
mechanically selects for generative, causal models through
exception-accumulation dynamics, making reality alignment a consequence rather
than a contingent achievement. Together, ITI and CEP define a causal chain:
from survival pressure to prediction necessity, compression requirement,
efficiency optimization, generative structure discovery, and ultimately reality
alignment. Each link follows from physical, information-theoretic, or
evolutionary constraints, implying that intelligence is the mechanically
necessary outcome of persistence in structured environments. This framework
yields empirically testable predictions: compression efficiency, measured as
approach to the rate-distortion frontier, correlates with out-of-distribution
generalization; exception-accumulation rates differentiate causal from
correlational models; hierarchical systems exhibit increasing efficiency across
abstraction layers; and biological systems demonstrate metabolic costs that
track representational complexity. ITI and CEP thereby provide a unified
account of convergence across biological, artificial, and multi-scale systems,
addressing the epistemic and functional dimensions of intelligence without
invoking assumptions about consciousness or subjective experience.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于LLM的评判者难以校准，存在评分标准敏感性、偏见和不稳定性问题，这影响了RLHF奖励模型和模型路由系统等关键应用的可靠性。

Method: 提出了基于角色的偏好建模框架，通过聚合多个基于评分标准的评判者输出；实现了两种聚合器：广义加性模型(GAM)和多层感知器(MLP)；开发了基于角色的方法用于大规模合成偏好标签。

Result: 评估了该方法相对于简单基线的性能，并通过案例研究评估了其对人类和LLM评判者偏见的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效建模多样化的基于角色的偏好，为校准LLM评判者提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Aligning LLM-based judges with human preferences is a significant challenge,
as they are difficult to calibrate and often suffer from rubric sensitivity,
bias, and instability. Overcoming this challenge advances key applications,
such as creating reliable reward models for Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) and building effective routing systems that select the
best-suited model for a given user query. In this work, we propose a framework
for modeling diverse, persona-based preferences by learning to aggregate
outputs from multiple rubric-conditioned judges. We investigate the performance
of this approach against naive baselines and assess its robustness through case
studies on both human and LLM-judges biases. Our primary contributions include
a persona-based method for synthesizing preference labels at scale and two
distinct implementations of our aggregator: Generalized Additive Model (GAM)
and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SciTrust 2.0是一个评估LLM在科学应用中可信度的综合框架，涵盖真实性、对抗鲁棒性、科学安全和科学伦理四个维度。评估显示通用行业模型在各方面优于科学专用模型，后者在逻辑和伦理推理方面存在显著缺陷。


<details>

Motivation: LLM在科学研究中展现出变革潜力，但在高风险场景部署时存在可信度问题，需要系统评估框架来确保其安全性和可靠性。

Method: 开发了包含新颖开放式真实性基准和科学伦理基准的综合评估框架，使用验证的反思调优流程和专家验证，采用准确性、语义相似度和LLM评分等多种评估指标。

Result: 评估了7个主流LLM，通用行业模型在各项可信度维度上均优于科学专用模型，GPT-o4-mini在真实性和对抗鲁棒性方面表现最佳，科学专用模型在逻辑推理、伦理推理和高风险领域安全性方面存在严重缺陷。

Conclusion: 通过开源该框架，为开发更可信的AI系统提供了基础，并推动了科学背景下模型安全性和伦理研究的进展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential in
scientific research, yet their deployment in high-stakes contexts raises
significant trustworthiness concerns. Here, we introduce SciTrust 2.0, a
comprehensive framework for evaluating LLM trustworthiness in scientific
applications across four dimensions: truthfulness, adversarial robustness,
scientific safety, and scientific ethics. Our framework incorporates novel,
open-ended truthfulness benchmarks developed through a verified
reflection-tuning pipeline and expert validation, alongside a novel ethics
benchmark for scientific research contexts covering eight subcategories
including dual-use research and bias. We evaluated seven prominent LLMs,
including four science-specialized models and three general-purpose industry
models, using multiple evaluation metrics including accuracy, semantic
similarity measures, and LLM-based scoring. General-purpose industry models
overall outperformed science-specialized models across each trustworthiness
dimension, with GPT-o4-mini demonstrating superior performance in truthfulness
assessments and adversarial robustness. Science-specialized models showed
significant deficiencies in logical and ethical reasoning capabilities, along
with concerning vulnerabilities in safety evaluations, particularly in
high-risk domains such as biosecurity and chemical weapons. By open-sourcing
our framework, we provide a foundation for developing more trustworthy AI
systems and advancing research on model safety and ethics in scientific
contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FinOps从业者面临来自多个云提供商和内部系统的异构账单数据格式、分类和指标，导致难以合成可操作的见解和做出及时决策。

Method: 构建了一个模拟真实端到端行业流程的FinOps代理系统，从多源数据检索到数据整合分析，再到生成优化建议。使用多个开源和闭源语言模型评估代理性能。

Result: 评估结果显示该代理能够像实际FinOps从业者一样理解、规划和执行任务。

Conclusion: 自主AI代理可以有效解决FinOps中的数据异构挑战，实现自动化成本优化。

Abstract: FinOps (Finance + Operations) represents an operational framework and
cultural practice which maximizes cloud business value through collaborative
financial accountability across engineering, finance, and business teams.
FinOps practitioners face a fundamental challenge: billing data arrives in
heterogeneous formats, taxonomies, and metrics from multiple cloud providers
and internal systems which eventually lead to synthesizing actionable insights,
and making time-sensitive decisions. To address this challenge, we propose
leveraging autonomous, goal-driven AI agents for FinOps automation. In this
paper, we built a FinOps agent for a typical use-case for IT infrastructure and
cost optimization. We built a system simulating a realistic end-to-end industry
process starting with retrieving data from various sources to consolidating and
analyzing the data to generate recommendations for optimization. We defined a
set of metrics to evaluate our agent using several open-source and close-source
language models and it shows that the agent was able to understand, plan, and
execute tasks as well as an actual FinOps practitioner.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 一个3.8B参数的小模型在FACTS基准测试中达到GPT-4o水平，在±5%等效范围内表现相当，云服务成本降低约19倍，自托管部署边际成本接近零。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索小语言模型在事实基础任务上的潜力，通过优化推理框架和微调方法，实现与大模型相当的性能但显著降低成本。

Method: 结合最小化的"外骨骼推理"框架和行为微调，教导协议遵守而非领域知识，两者协同作用显著提升性能并降低方差。

Result: 在Q1-Q500测试中，Humans-Junior(72.7%)与GPT-4o(73.5%)差异仅0.8%，在±5%范围内等效；推理成本降低约19倍。

Conclusion: 小模型通过精心设计的推理框架和微调策略，可以在特定任务上达到前沿大模型性能，同时大幅降低成本，为边缘部署和成本敏感应用提供可行方案。

Abstract: We introduce Humans-Junior, a 3.8B model that matches GPT-4o on the FACTS
Grounding public subset within a $\pm 5$ pp equivalence margin.
  Results. On Q1--Q500 under identical judges, GPT-4o scores 73.5% (95% CI
69.5--77.2) and Humans-Junior 72.7% (95% CI 68.7--76.5); the paired difference
is 0.8 pp (bootstrap 95% CI $-3.1$ to $+4.7$; permutation $p = 0.72$; Cohen's
$d = 0.023$). TOST establishes equivalence at $\pm 5$ pp (not at $\pm 3$ pp).
When purchased as managed APIs, Humans-Junior's base model
(Phi-3.5-mini-instruct) is $\approx 19\times$ less expensive than GPT-4o on
Microsoft AI Foundry pricing; self-hosted or edge deployments can drive
incremental inference cost toward zero. Measured vs estimated pricing sources
are tabulated in Appendix E.
  Method. Our approach combines minimal directed "Exoskeleton Reasoning"
scaffolds with behavioral fine-tuning that teaches protocol compliance
(epistemic discipline) rather than domain answers. Fine-tuning alone adds
little; combined, they synergize (+17.7 pp, $p < 0.001$) and reduce variance
($\approx 25\%$). In prompt-only settings on frontier models (Q1--Q100;
non-comparable), directed reasoning improved GPT-4o by +11.8 pp to 85.3% and
Gemini-2.5-Pro by +5.0 pp to 93.3% (baseline 88.3%, $n = 100$); see Section~5.
  TL;DR. A 3.8B model achieves GPT-4o-level FACTS accuracy (equivalent within
$\pm 5$ pp on Q1--Q500). Cloud pricing shows $\approx 19\times$ lower cost
versus GPT-4o, and self-hosted/edge deployments can approach zero marginal
cost. Pricing sources are listed in Appendix E. Frontier prompt-only gains
(Q1--Q100; non-comparable) and optimized-prompt exploratory results under
earlier judges are summarized in Appendix F.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类的目标导向行为受到认知偏差的影响，与人类交互的自主系统需要意识到这一点。例如，人们在日常任务（如驾驶）中会对环境中的物体产生系统性的注意力偏差。

Method: 结合深度强化学习和计算认知建模的方法，正式阐述了注意力感知的逆规划问题，旨在从人的行为中估计其注意力偏差。

Result: 在Waymo开放数据集中的真实驾驶场景中，成功推断出强化学习智能体的注意力策略，证明了注意力感知逆规划在估计认知偏差方面的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 注意力感知逆规划与标准逆强化学习存在系统性差异，能够有效推断认知偏差，为理解人类行为中的注意力机制提供了新的计算框架。

Abstract: People's goal-directed behaviors are influenced by their cognitive biases,
and autonomous systems that interact with people should be aware of this. For
example, people's attention to objects in their environment will be biased in a
way that systematically affects how they perform everyday tasks such as driving
to work. Here, building on recent work in computational cognitive science, we
formally articulate the attention-aware inverse planning problem, in which the
goal is to estimate a person's attentional biases from their actions. We
demonstrate how attention-aware inverse planning systematically differs from
standard inverse reinforcement learning and how cognitive biases can be
inferred from behavior. Finally, we present an approach to attention-aware
inverse planning that combines deep reinforcement learning with computational
cognitive modeling. We use this approach to infer the attentional strategies of
RL agents in real-life driving scenarios selected from the Waymo Open Dataset,
demonstrating the scalability of estimating cognitive biases with
attention-aware inverse planning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于代理的NL-to-SQL系统，通过ReAct代理协调查询规划、分解和适应，显著提升了时空查询的准确性和可用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NL-to-SQL系统在处理现实时空查询时表现不佳，需要解决用户模糊表达与数据库模式的匹配、时间推理和输出选择等问题。

Method: 扩展了基础的文本到SQL模型(llama-3-sqlcoder-8b)，使用Mistral-based ReAct代理进行编排，支持模式检查、SQL生成、执行和可视化工具。

Result: 在NYC和Tokyo签到数据集的35个自然语言查询上，代理方法达到91.4%的准确率，远高于基线模型的28.6%，并通过地图、图表和自然语言摘要增强了可用性。

Conclusion: 代理编排而非更强的SQL生成器本身，是构建交互式地理空间助手的有前景的基础。

Abstract: Natural-language-to-SQL (NL-to-SQL) systems hold promise for democratizing
access to structured data, allowing users to query databases without learning
SQL. Yet existing systems struggle with realistic spatio-temporal queries,
where success requires aligning vague user phrasing with schema-specific
categories, handling temporal reasoning, and choosing appropriate outputs. We
present an agentic pipeline that extends a naive text-to-SQL baseline
(llama-3-sqlcoder-8b) with orchestration by a Mistral-based ReAct agent. The
agent can plan, decompose, and adapt queries through schema inspection, SQL
generation, execution, and visualization tools. We evaluate on 35
natural-language queries over the NYC and Tokyo check-in dataset, covering
spatial, temporal, and multi-dataset reasoning. The agent achieves
substantially higher accuracy than the naive baseline 91.4% vs. 28.6% and
enhances usability through maps, plots, and structured natural-language
summaries. Crucially, our design enables more natural human-database
interaction, supporting users who lack SQL expertise, detailed schema
knowledge, or prompting skill. We conclude that agentic orchestration, rather
than stronger SQL generators alone, is a promising foundation for interactive
geospatial assistants.

Abstract: The rapid growth of research literature, particularly in large language
models (LLMs), has made producing comprehensive and current survey papers
increasingly difficult. This paper introduces autosurvey2, a multi-stage
pipeline that automates survey generation through retrieval-augmented synthesis
and structured evaluation. The system integrates parallel section generation,
iterative refinement, and real-time retrieval of recent publications to ensure
both topical completeness and factual accuracy. Quality is assessed using a
multi-LLM evaluation framework that measures coverage, structure, and relevance
in alignment with expert review standards. Experimental results demonstrate
that autosurvey2 consistently outperforms existing retrieval-based and
automated baselines, achieving higher scores in structural coherence and
topical relevance while maintaining strong citation fidelity. By combining

### [243] [Large Language Model-assisted Autonomous Vehicle Recovery from Immobilization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26023)
*Zhipeng Bao,Qianwen Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: StuckSolver是一个基于大语言模型的自动驾驶车辆恢复框架，通过自主推理和乘客引导决策来解决车辆被困场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动驾驶车辆在某些交通场景中容易陷入困境，而现有的远程干预和手动接管方案成本高、效率低且限制可访问性。

Method: 设计为插件式附加模块，利用标准传感器数据流检测被困状态、解释环境上下文，并生成可由车辆原生规划器执行的高级恢复命令。

Result: 在Bench2Drive基准测试和自定义不确定性场景中，StuckSolver仅通过自主推理就达到接近最先进的性能，结合乘客指导后性能进一步提升。

Conclusion: StuckSolver提供了一种有效的自动驾驶车辆恢复解决方案，无需修改车辆内部架构即可显著提升在复杂交通场景中的应对能力。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in recent decades, autonomous vehicles (AVs)
continue to face challenges in navigating certain traffic scenarios where human
drivers excel. In such situations, AVs often become immobilized, disrupting
overall traffic flow. Current recovery solutions, such as remote intervention
(which is costly and inefficient) and manual takeover (which excludes
non-drivers and limits AV accessibility), are inadequate. This paper introduces
StuckSolver, a novel Large Language Model (LLM) driven recovery framework that
enables AVs to resolve immobilization scenarios through self-reasoning and/or
passenger-guided decision-making. StuckSolver is designed as a plug-in add-on
module that operates on top of the AV's existing perception-planning-control
stack, requiring no modification to its internal architecture. Instead, it
interfaces with standard sensor data streams to detect immobilization states,
interpret environmental context, and generate high-level recovery commands that
can be executed by the AV's native planner. We evaluate StuckSolver on the
Bench2Drive benchmark and in custom-designed uncertainty scenarios. Results
show that StuckSolver achieves near-state-of-the-art performance through
autonomous self-reasoning alone and exhibits further improvements when
passenger guidance is incorporated.

*Andrew L. Kun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨了AI问责性的重要性，分析了当前AI缺乏问责性的现状，并提出了改善AI问责性的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI能力的快速增强，确保AI对消费者、选民和决策者负责变得至关重要。当前AI往往无法被质疑、讨论或制裁，缺乏问责性。

Method: 将一般问责性定义应用于AI，说明AI问责与不问责的含义，探索提高AI问责性的方法。

Result: 明确了AI问责性的概念框架，指出了当前AI问责性不足的问题。

Conclusion: 需要采取措施确保所有AI都能对受其影响的人负责，构建一个AI问责的世界。

Abstract: The AI we use is powerful, and its power is increasing rapidly. If this
powerful AI is to serve the needs of consumers, voters, and decision makers,
then it is imperative that the AI is accountable. In general, an agent is
accountable to a forum if the forum can request information from the agent
about its actions, if the forum and the agent can discuss this information, and
if the forum can sanction the agent. Unfortunately, in too many cases today's
AI is not accountable -- we cannot question it, enter into a discussion with
it, let alone sanction it. In this chapter we relate the general definition of
accountability to AI, we illustrate what it means for AI to be accountable and
unaccountable, and we explore approaches that can improve our chances of living
in a world where all AI is accountable to those who are affected by it.

Abstract: We present **Lean4PHYS**, a comprehensive reasoning framework for
college-level physics problems in Lean4. **Lean4PHYS** includes
*LeanPhysBench*, a college-level benchmark for formal physics reasoning in
Lean4, which contains 200 hand-crafted and peer-reviewed statements derived
from university textbooks and physics competition problems. To establish a
solid foundation for formal reasoning in physics, we also introduce *PhysLib*,
a community-driven repository containing fundamental unit systems and theorems
essential for formal physics reasoning. Based on the benchmark and Lean4
repository we composed in **Lean4PHYS**, we report baseline results using major
expert Math Lean4 provers and state-of-the-art closed-source models, with the
best performance of DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B achieving only 16% and
Claude-Sonnet-4 achieving 35%. We also conduct a detailed analysis showing that
our *PhysLib* can achieve an average improvement of 11.75% in model
performance. This demonstrates the challenging nature of our *LeanPhysBench*
and the effectiveness of *PhysLib*. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study to provide a physics benchmark in Lean4.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文分析了大型视觉语言模型在GUI任务自动化中的知识缺陷，提出了GUI知识的三个维度框架，并创建了GUI Knowledge Bench基准来评估模型能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型视觉语言模型在GUI任务自动化方面仍落后于人类，作者假设这是由于缺乏核心GUI知识，而现有的训练方法无法完全解决这一问题。

Method: 通过分析GUI任务执行中的常见失败模式，将GUI知识提炼为三个维度：界面感知、交互预测和指令理解。创建了涵盖6个平台、292个应用的多选题和是非题基准。

Result: 评估显示当前VLMs能识别控件功能，但在感知系统状态、预测动作和验证任务完成方面存在困难。真实GUI任务实验验证了GUI知识与任务成功之间的紧密联系。

Conclusion: 通过提供评估GUI知识的结构化框架，本研究支持在下游训练前选择更具潜力的VLMs，并为构建更强大的GUI智能体提供了见解。

Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) have advanced graphical user interface
(GUI) task automation but still lag behind humans. We hypothesize this gap
stems from missing core GUI knowledge, which existing training schemes (such as
supervised fine tuning and reinforcement learning) alone cannot fully address.
By analyzing common failure patterns in GUI task execution, we distill GUI
knowledge into three dimensions: (1) interface perception, knowledge about
recognizing widgets and system states; (2) interaction prediction, knowledge
about reasoning action state transitions; and (3) instruction understanding,
knowledge about planning, verifying, and assessing task completion progress. We
further introduce GUI Knowledge Bench, a benchmark with multiple choice and
yes/no questions across six platforms (Web, Android, MacOS, Windows, Linux,
IOS) and 292 applications. Our evaluation shows that current VLMs identify
widget functions but struggle with perceiving system states, predicting
actions, and verifying task completion. Experiments on real world GUI tasks
further validate the close link between GUI knowledge and task success. By
providing a structured framework for assessing GUI knowledge, our work supports
the selection of VLMs with greater potential prior to downstream training and
provides insights for building more capable GUI agents.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个量化的大语言模型推理经济学框架，将LLM推理视为计算驱动的智能生产活动，通过实证数据构建了首个LLM推理生产前沿，揭示了三个关键原则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的推理成本已成为决定其商业可行性和广泛应用的关键因素，需要建立经济分析框架来指导模型部署决策。

Method: 采用定量经济学框架分析LLM推理的边际成本、规模经济和输出质量，基于WiNEval-3.0的实证数据构建LLM推理生产前沿。

Result: 发现了三个关键原则：边际成本递减、规模收益递减以及存在最优成本效益区域，构建了首个LLM推理生产前沿。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅为模型部署决策提供了经济基础，还为未来AI推理资源的市场定价和优化奠定了实证基础。

Abstract: The inference cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a critical
factor in determining their commercial viability and widespread adoption. This
paper introduces a quantitative ``economics of inference'' framework, treating
the LLM inference process as a compute-driven intelligent production activity.
We analyze its marginal cost, economies of scale, and quality of output under
various performance configurations. Based on empirical data from WiNEval-3.0,
we construct the first ``LLM Inference Production Frontier,'' revealing three
principles: diminishing marginal cost, diminishing returns to scale, and an
optimal cost-effectiveness zone. This paper not only provides an economic basis
for model deployment decisions but also lays an empirical foundation for the
future market-based pricing and optimization of AI inference resources.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Reasoning Curriculum两阶段课程学习方法：第一阶段在数学领域进行强化学习培养推理能力，第二阶段在多领域联合强化学习来迁移和巩固这些能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法主要关注数学和代码领域，缺乏在其他领域激发大语言模型推理能力的方法。

Method: 两阶段课程学习：1）数学领域RL冷启动和可验证奖励训练；2）多领域联合RL迁移和巩固推理技能。

Result: 在Qwen3-4B和Llama-3.1-8B模型上测试多领域任务，推理课程方法带来一致性能提升。

Conclusion: 该课程方法提供了一种紧凑、易于采用的通用推理能力培养方案，数学优先的激发策略对解决复杂问题至关重要。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can elicit strong reasoning in large language
models (LLMs), yet most open efforts focus on math and code. We propose
Reasoning Curriculum, a simple two-stage curriculum that first elicits
reasoning skills in pretraining-aligned domains such as math, then adapts and
refines these skills across other domains via joint RL. Stage 1 performs a
brief cold start and then math-only RL with verifiable rewards to develop
reasoning skills. Stage 2 runs joint RL on mixed-domain data to transfer and
consolidate these skills. The curriculum is minimal and backbone-agnostic,
requiring no specialized reward models beyond standard verifiability checks.
Evaluated on Qwen3-4B and Llama-3.1-8B over a multi-domain suite, reasoning
curriculum yields consistent gains. Ablations and a cognitive-skill analysis
indicate that both stages are necessary and that math-first elicitation
increases cognitive behaviors important for solving complex problems. Reasoning
Curriculum provides a compact, easy-to-adopt recipe for general reasoning.

Motivation: 利用LLM推动自主AI研究代理的发展，解决复杂的现实世界挑战，加速科学和工程发现

Method: 集成冷启动初始化、新型进化采样策略、领域特定评估器（结合正确性、有效性和LLM监督反馈）以及基于Ray的分布式异步执行基础设施

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到SOTA：ALE-Bench 1976.3（+5.2%）、MLE-Bench 43.56%（+4.0pp）、KernelBench最高20倍加速，并在经典数学问题上建立新SOTA

Conclusion: FM Agent在企业和基础科学研究中具有广阔应用前景，能够加速创新、自动化复杂发现过程，带来显著的工程和科学进步

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are catalyzing the development of autonomous AI
research agents for scientific and engineering discovery. We present FM Agent,
a novel and general-purpose multi-agent framework that leverages a synergistic
combination of LLM-based reasoning and large-scale evolutionary search to
address complex real-world challenges. The core of FM Agent integrates several
key innovations: 1) a cold-start initialization phase incorporating expert
guidance, 2) a novel evolutionary sampling strategy for iterative optimization,
3) domain-specific evaluators that combine correctness, effectiveness, and
LLM-supervised feedback, and 4) a distributed, asynchronous execution
infrastructure built on Ray. Demonstrating broad applicability, our system has
been evaluated across diverse domains, including operations research, machine
learning, GPU kernel optimization, and classical mathematical problems. FM
Agent reaches state-of-the-art results autonomously, without human
interpretation or tuning -- 1976.3 on ALE-Bench (+5.2\%), 43.56\% on MLE-Bench
(+4.0pp), up to 20x speedups on KernelBench, and establishes new
state-of-the-art(SOTA) results on several classical mathematical problems.
Beyond academic benchmarks, FM Agent shows considerable promise for both
large-scale enterprise R\&D workflows and fundamental scientific research,
where it can accelerate innovation, automate complex discovery processes, and
deliver substantial engineering and scientific advances with broader societal
impact.

TL;DR: 提出了ToolRM系列轻量级生成式奖励模型，专门用于工具使用场景，通过构建ToolPref-Pairwise-30K数据集和TRBench基准，显著提升了工具调用任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在工具学习领域，缺乏专门为函数调用任务设计的奖励模型，这限制了智能代理AI的发展。

Method: 提出新颖的数据构建流程，使用基于规则的评分和多维采样构建成对偏好数据，创建ToolPref-Pairwise-30K数据集，并在Qwen3-4B/8B系列模型上训练ToolRM。

Result: ToolRM在成对奖励判断中准确率提升14.28%，显著超越Claude 4和OpenAI o3等前沿模型，在ACEBench上减少超过66%的输出token使用。

Conclusion: ToolRM不仅适用于训练目标，还能泛化到更广泛的评判任务，包括Best-of-N采样和自我修正，为未来研究提供了数据和模型检查点。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human preferences. Yet in the domain of tool learning, the lack of
RMs specifically designed for function-calling tasks has limited progress
toward more capable agentic AI. We introduce ToolRM, a family of lightweight
generative RMs tailored for general tool-use scenarios. To build these models,
we propose a novel pipeline that constructs pairwise preference data using
rule-based scoring and multidimensional sampling. This yields
ToolPref-Pairwise-30K, a diverse, balanced, and challenging dataset of critique
tasks that supports reinforcement learning with verifiable feedback. To
evaluate tool-use RMs, we also introduce TRBench$_{BFCL}$, a benchmark built on
the agentic evaluation suite BFCL. Trained on our constructed data, models from
the Qwen3-4B/8B series achieve up to 14.28% higher accuracy, substantially
outperforming frontier models such as Claude 4 and OpenAI o3 in pairwise reward
judgments. Beyond training objectives, ToolRM generalizes to broader critique
tasks, including Best-of-N sampling and self-correction. Experiments on
ACEBench highlight its effectiveness and efficiency, enabling inference-time
scaling and reducing output token usage by over 66%. We release data and model
checkpoints to facilitate future research.

TL;DR: 提出了QASU基准，用于评估LLM处理问卷数据的结构化能力，发现选择合适的序列化格式和提示策略可以显著提升准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在处理大规模问卷数据方面存在能力不足，现有调查分析工具难以与LLM集成，缺乏将问卷数据有效表示给LLM的指导方法

Method: 开发QASU基准，测试六种结构化技能，评估六种序列化格式和多种提示策略，通过自增强提示添加轻量级结构提示

Result: 选择合适的格式和提示组合可将准确率提升8.8个百分点，特定任务中通过自增强提示可额外提升3-4个百分点

Conclusion: QASU基准为基于LLM的问卷分析提供了简单而多功能的基础，通过系统隔离格式和提示效应，推动研究和实际应用发展

Abstract: Millions of people take surveys every day, from market polls and academic
studies to medical questionnaires and customer feedback forms. These datasets
capture valuable insights, but their scale and structure present a unique
challenge for large language models (LLMs), which otherwise excel at few-shot
reasoning over open-ended text. Yet, their ability to process questionnaire
data or lists of questions crossed with hundreds of respondent rows remains
underexplored. Current retrieval and survey analysis tools (e.g., Qualtrics,
SPSS, REDCap) are typically designed for humans in the workflow, limiting such
data integration with LLM and AI-empowered automation. This gap leaves
scientists, surveyors, and everyday users without evidence-based guidance on
how to best represent questionnaires for LLM consumption. We address this by
introducing QASU (Questionnaire Analysis and Structural Understanding), a
benchmark that probes six structural skills, including answer lookup,
respondent count, and multi-hop inference, across six serialization formats and
multiple prompt strategies. Experiments on contemporary LLMs show that choosing
an effective format and prompt combination can improve accuracy by up to 8.8%
points compared to suboptimal formats. For specific tasks, carefully adding a
lightweight structural hint through self-augmented prompting can yield further
improvements of 3-4% points on average. By systematically isolating format and
prompting effects, our open source benchmark offers a simple yet versatile
foundation for advancing both research and real-world practice in LLM-based
questionnaire analysis.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: REG-TSC使用检索增强生成技术增强分布式LLM代理，通过紧急感知推理框架和类型无关交通表示，在异构交叉口实现通用交通信号控制，显著减少旅行时间、排队长度和紧急车辆等待时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM方法在紧急情况下容易产生幻觉导致不可靠决策，且不同交叉口类型给交通状态编码和跨交叉口训练带来挑战，限制了在异构交叉口间的泛化能力。

Method: 提出紧急感知推理框架，基于紧急情况动态调整推理深度，使用Reviewer-based Emergency RAG从历史案例中提取知识；设计类型无关交通表示和Reward-guided Reinforced Refinement，自适应采样异构交叉口训练经验并微调LLM代理。

Result: 在3个真实道路网络上（17-177个异构交叉口）的实验显示，REG-TSC减少旅行时间42.00%、排队长度62.31%、紧急车辆等待时间83.16%，优于其他最先进方法。

Conclusion: REG-TSC通过RAG增强的分布式LLM代理和紧急响应机制，在异构交叉口实现了可靠且通用的交通信号控制，显著提升了交通效率和紧急响应能力。

Abstract: With increasing urban traffic complexity, Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is
essential for optimizing traffic flow and improving road safety. Large Language
Models (LLMs) emerge as promising approaches for TSC. However, they are prone
to hallucinations in emergencies, leading to unreliable decisions that may
cause substantial delays for emergency vehicles. Moreover, diverse intersection
types present substantial challenges for traffic state encoding and
cross-intersection training, limiting generalization across heterogeneous
intersections. Therefore, this paper proposes Retrieval Augmented Generation
(RAG)-enhanced distributed LLM agents with Emergency response for Generalizable
TSC (REG-TSC). Firstly, this paper presents an emergency-aware reasoning
framework, which dynamically adjusts reasoning depth based on the emergency
scenario and is equipped with a novel Reviewer-based Emergency RAG (RERAG) to
distill specific knowledge and guidance from historical cases, enhancing the
reliability and rationality of agents' emergency decisions. Secondly, this
paper designs a type-agnostic traffic representation and proposes a
Reward-guided Reinforced Refinement (R3) for heterogeneous intersections. R3
adaptively samples training experience from diverse intersections with
environment feedback-based priority and fine-tunes LLM agents with a designed
reward-weighted likelihood loss, guiding REG-TSC toward high-reward policies
across heterogeneous intersections. On three real-world road networks with 17
to 177 heterogeneous intersections, extensive experiments show that REG-TSC
reduces travel time by 42.00%, queue length by 62.31%, and emergency vehicle
waiting time by 83.16%, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: GEPO通过构建状态转移图和使用图论中心性来解决多轮交互LLM智能体训练中的结构盲问题，在三个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于群体的强化学习方法在多轮交互LLM智能体训练中存在的结构盲问题，包括探索效率低、信用分配不准确和规划短视三个关键挑战。

Method: 动态构建状态转移图，利用图论中心性提供三个协同学习信号：结构化内在奖励、图增强优势函数和动态折扣因子。

Result: 在ALFWorld、WebShop和专有Workbench基准测试中，分别实现了+4.1%、+5.3%和+10.9%的绝对成功率提升。

Conclusion: 显式建模环境结构是推进LLM智能体训练的稳健且可泛化的策略。

Abstract: Group based reinforcement learning (RL) has shown impressive results on
complex reasoning and mathematical tasks. Yet, when applied to train
multi-turn, interactive LLM agents, these methods often suffer from structural
blindness-the inability to exploit the underlying connectivity of the
environment. This manifests in three critical challenges: (1) inefficient,
unguided exploration, (2) imprecise credit assignment due to overlooking
pivotal states, and (3) myopic planning caused by static reward discounting. We
address these issues with Graph-Enhanced Policy Optimization (GEPO), which
dynamically constructs a state-transition graph from agent experience and
employs graph-theoretic centrality to provide three synergistic learning
signals: (1)structured intrinsic rewards that guide exploration toward
high-impact states, (2) a graph-enhanced advantage function for topology-aware
credit assignment, and (3) a dynamic discount factor adapted to each state's
strategic value. On the ALFWorld, WebShop, and a proprietary Workbench
benchmarks, GEPO demonstrates strong performance, achieving absolute success
rate gains of +4.1%, +5.3%, and +10.9% over competitive baselines. These
results highlight that explicitly modeling environmental structure is a robust,
generalizable strategy for advancing LLM agent training.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GraphCompliance框架通过将法规文本表示为政策图，运行时上下文表示为上下文图，并将两者对齐，来改进网络规模的合规性评估。该方法在GDPR相关场景中比纯LLM和RAG基线表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络规模合规性面临实际挑战：每个请求都需要监管评估。法规文本是交叉引用和规范性的，而运行时上下文用非结构化自然语言表达。这促使我们将非结构化文本中的语义信息与法规的结构化、规范性元素对齐。

Method: 引入GraphCompliance框架，将法规文本表示为政策图（编码规范结构和交叉引用），运行时上下文表示为上下文图（将事件形式化为SAO和实体关系三元组），并将两者对齐。这种对齐将法官LLM的推理锚定在结构化信息中。

Result: 在300个GDPR衍生真实场景的五个评估任务中，GraphCompliance比纯LLM和RAG基线的micro-F1高出4.1-7.2个百分点，具有更少的欠预测和过预测，导致更高的召回率和更低的假阳性率。

Conclusion: 消融研究表明每个图组件都有贡献，表明结构化表示和法官LLM对于规范性推理是互补的。

Abstract: Compliance at web scale poses practical challenges: each request may require
a regulatory assessment. Regulatory texts (e.g., the General Data Protection
Regulation, GDPR) are cross-referential and normative, while runtime contexts
are expressed in unstructured natural language. This setting motivates us to
align semantic information in unstructured text with the structured, normative
elements of regulations. To this end, we introduce GraphCompliance, a framework
that represents regulatory texts as a Policy Graph and runtime contexts as a
Context Graph, and aligns them. In this formulation, the policy graph encodes
normative structure and cross-references, whereas the context graph formalizes
events as subject-action-object (SAO) and entity-relation triples. This
alignment anchors the reasoning of a judge large language model (LLM) in
structured information and helps reduce the burden of regulatory interpretation
and event parsing, enabling a focus on the core reasoning step. In experiments
on 300 GDPR-derived real-world scenarios spanning five evaluation tasks,
GraphCompliance yields 4.1-7.2 percentage points (pp) higher micro-F1 than
LLM-only and RAG baselines, with fewer under- and over-predictions, resulting
in higher recall and lower false positive rates. Ablation studies indicate
contributions from each graph component, suggesting that structured
representations and a judge LLM are complementary for normative reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了IPA-UCT方法，通过放宽状态抽象条件来增强MCTS的样本效率，在多种测试领域和迭代预算下优于现有的OGA-UCT方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的状态-动作对抽象方法（如OGA-UCT）在噪声或大动作空间设置中难以找到状态抽象，限制了MCTS的样本效率提升。

Method: 提出了IPA-UCT方法，使用较弱的理想剪枝抽象（IPA）条件，以轻微精度损失换取更多状态抽象。IPA和ASAP都是更通用p-ASAP框架的特例。

Result: IPA-UCT在大量测试领域和迭代预算下实验验证优于OGA-UCT及其衍生方法。

Conclusion: IPA-UCT通过放宽抽象条件成功解决了状态抽象稀缺问题，为MCTS提供了更有效的样本效率提升方案。

Abstract: One approach to enhance Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is to improve its
sample efficiency by grouping/abstracting states or state-action pairs and
sharing statistics within a group. Though state-action pair abstractions are
mostly easy to find in algorithms such as On the Go Abstractions in Upper
Confidence bounds applied to Trees (OGA-UCT), nearly no state abstractions are
found in either noisy or large action space settings due to constraining
conditions. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence for this claim, and
we slightly alleviate this state abstraction problem by proposing a weaker
state abstraction condition that trades a minor loss in accuracy for finding
many more abstractions. We name this technique Ideal Pruning Abstractions in
UCT (IPA-UCT), which outperforms OGA-UCT (and any of its derivatives) across a
large range of test domains and iteration budgets as experimentally validated.
IPA-UCT uses a different abstraction framework from Abstraction of State-Action
Pairs (ASAP) which is the one used by OGA-UCT, which we name IPA. Furthermore,
we show that both IPA and ASAP are special cases of a more general framework
that we call p-ASAP which itself is a special case of the ASASAP framework.

Conclusion: BOTS为RFT中的动态任务选择提供了一个实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement finetuning (RFT) is a key technique for aligning Large Language

effectiveness is highly sensitive to which tasks are explored during training.
Uniform task sampling is inefficient, wasting computation on tasks that are
either trivial or unsolvable, while existing task selection methods often
suffer from high rollout costs, poor adaptivity, or incomplete evidence. We
introduce \textbf{BOTS}, a unified framework for \textbf{B}ayesian
\textbf{O}nline \textbf{T}ask \textbf{S}election in LLM reinforcement
finetuning. Grounded in Bayesian inference, BOTS adaptively maintains posterior
estimates of task difficulty as the model evolves. It jointly incorporates
\emph{explicit evidence} from direct evaluations of selected tasks and
\emph{implicit evidence} inferred from these evaluations for unselected tasks,
with Thompson sampling ensuring a principled balance between exploration and
exploitation. To make implicit evidence practical, we instantiate it with an
ultra-light interpolation-based plug-in that estimates difficulties of
unevaluated tasks without extra rollouts, adding negligible overhead.
Empirically, across diverse domains and LLM scales, BOTS consistently improves
data efficiency and performance over baselines and ablations, providing a
practical and extensible solution for dynamic task selection in RFT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然AI在数学推理方面取得显著进展，但在数学研究实践中的应用仍然有限。研究旨在探索AI如何作为研究伙伴而非单纯问题解决者，实现人机协作的数学发现。

Method: 通过分析AI数学家的自主推理轨迹，结合针对性的人工干预来结构化发现过程。采用迭代分解问题为可处理子目标、选择适当分析方法、验证中间结果等方法。

Result: 该方法产生了完整且可验证的证明，展示了人类直觉与机器计算如何相互补充，增强了证明的可靠性、透明性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 人机协作范式能够推进数学发现前沿，在保持人类对形式严谨性和正确性监督的同时，提高证明的质量和可信度。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated impressive progress in
mathematical reasoning, yet its integration into the practice of mathematical
research remains limited. In this study, we investigate how the AI
Mathematician (AIM) system can operate as a research partner rather than a mere
problem solver. Focusing on a challenging problem in homogenization theory, we
analyze the autonomous reasoning trajectories of AIM and incorporate targeted
human interventions to structure the discovery process. Through iterative
decomposition of the problem into tractable subgoals, selection of appropriate
analytical methods, and validation of intermediate results, we reveal how human
intuition and machine computation can complement one another. This
collaborative paradigm enhances the reliability, transparency, and
interpretability of the resulting proofs, while retaining human oversight for
formal rigor and correctness. The approach leads to a complete and verifiable
proof, and more broadly, demonstrates how systematic human-AI co-reasoning can
advance the frontier of mathematical discovery.

*Andrew M. Bean,Nabeel Seedat,Shengzhuang Chen,Jonathan Richard Schwarz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于任务项内在特性的基准子集选择方法Scales++，相比传统基于模型性能的方法，能大幅降低选择成本并保持预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于模型性能的基准子集选择方法存在高成本、冷启动问题严重、对未来模型适应性差等局限，需要一种更高效的基准评估方法。

Method: 采用项目中心的方法，基于任务项的认知需求进行数据选择，开发了Scales++方法，通过内在特性而非模型特定失败模式来选择基准子集。

Result: Scales++将前期选择成本降低18倍以上，仅使用0.5%的数据子集就能在Open LLM Leaderboard上以2.9%的平均绝对误差预测完整基准分数。

Conclusion: 项目中心的方法能够在不显著降低保真度的情况下实现更高效的模型评估，同时提供更好的冷启动性能和更可解释的基准测试。

Abstract: The prohibitive cost of evaluating large language models (LLMs) on
comprehensive benchmarks necessitates the creation of small yet representative
data subsets (i.e., tiny benchmarks) that enable efficient assessment while
retaining predictive fidelity. Current methods for this task operate under a
model-centric paradigm, selecting benchmarking items based on the collective
performance of existing models. Such approaches are limited by large upfront
costs, an inability to immediately handle new benchmarks (`cold-start'), and
the fragile assumption that future models will share the failure patterns of
their predecessors. In this work, we challenge this paradigm and propose a
item-centric approach to benchmark subset selection, arguing that selection
should be based on the intrinsic properties of the task items themselves,
rather than on model-specific failure patterns. We instantiate this
item-centric efficient benchmarking approach via a novel method, Scales++,
where data selection is based on the cognitive demands of the benchmark
samples. Empirically, we show Scales++ reduces the upfront selection cost by
over 18x while achieving competitive predictive fidelity. On the Open LLM
Leaderboard, using just a 0.5\% data subset, we predict full benchmark scores
with a 2.9% mean absolute error. We demonstrate that this item-centric approach
enables more efficient model evaluation without significant fidelity
degradation, while also providing better cold-start performance and more
interpretable benchmarking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI代理的出现将引发新型人格的"寒武纪大爆发"，需要实用框架来导航这种多样化，避免陷入关于AI意识或理性的无解辩论。

Method: 采用实用主义框架，将人格视为可解绑的义务集合，探讨去中心化数字身份技术，分析"人格作为问题"（设计选择可能利用人类社交启发式）和"人格作为解决方案"（赋予义务以确保问责）。

Result: 提出了一种更实用和灵活的方式来思考AI代理融入社会的问题，通过创建可制裁的"个体"目标来促进AI合同等实际工具。

Conclusion: 拒绝寻求单一、本质性的人格定义，采用实用主义方法能更好地整合AI代理到社会中，解决具体治理问题。

Abstract: The emergence of agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) is set to trigger a
"Cambrian explosion" of new kinds of personhood. This paper proposes a
pragmatic framework for navigating this diversification by treating personhood
not as a metaphysical property to be discovered, but as a flexible bundle of
obligations (rights and responsibilities) that societies confer upon entities
for a variety of reasons, especially to solve concrete governance problems. We
argue that this traditional bundle can be unbundled, creating bespoke solutions
for different contexts. This will allow for the creation of practical tools --
such as facilitating AI contracting by creating a target "individual" that can
be sanctioned -- without needing to resolve intractable debates about an AI's
consciousness or rationality. We explore how individuals fit in to social roles
and discuss the use of decentralized digital identity technology, examining
both "personhood as a problem", where design choices can create "dark patterns"
that exploit human social heuristics, and "personhood as a solution", where
conferring a bundle of obligations is necessary to ensure accountability or
prevent conflict. By rejecting foundationalist quests for a single, essential
definition of personhood, this paper offers a more pragmatic and flexible way
to think about integrating AI agents into our society.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Autograder+是一个智能编程评估系统，使用微调的大语言模型自动生成反馈，并通过代码可视化揭示学习模式，将传统自动评分从总结性评估转变为形成性学习体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自动评分系统作为黑盒仅返回通过/失败结果，无法提供对学生思维和学习需求的深入洞察，编程教育的快速发展超出了传统评估工具的能力范围。

Method: 使用微调的大语言模型基于精选的学生代码和专家反馈生成教学对齐的指导，通过对比学习代码嵌入对提交进行语义聚类，并支持提示池让教师引导反馈风格。

Result: 在600份学生提交的评估中，系统生成的反馈与教师评论具有强语义对齐，基于1000份标注提交训练的代码嵌入能够按功能和方法的相似性对解决方案进行有意义的聚类。

Conclusion: 通过整合AI驱动反馈、语义聚类和交互式可视化，Autograder+在减少教师工作量的同时支持针对性教学，促进更好的学习成果。

Abstract: The rapid growth of programming education has outpaced traditional assessment
tools, leaving faculty with limited means to provide meaningful, scalable
feedback. Conventional autograders, while efficient, act as black-box systems
that simply return pass/fail results, offering little insight into student
thinking or learning needs.
  Autograder+ is designed to shift autograding from a purely summative process
to a formative learning experience. It introduces two key capabilities:
automated feedback generation using a fine-tuned Large Language Model, and
visualization of student code submissions to uncover learning patterns. The
model is fine-tuned on curated student code and expert feedback to ensure
pedagogically aligned, context-aware guidance.
  In evaluation across 600 student submissions from multiple programming tasks,
the system produced feedback with strong semantic alignment to instructor
comments. For visualization, contrastively learned code embeddings trained on
1,000 annotated submissions enable grouping solutions into meaningful clusters
based on functionality and approach. The system also supports prompt-pooling,
allowing instructors to guide feedback style through selected prompt templates.
  By integrating AI-driven feedback, semantic clustering, and interactive
visualization, Autograder+ reduces instructor workload while supporting
targeted instruction and promoting stronger learning outcomes.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种医学稀疏自编码器(MedSAEs)方法，用于提高医学视觉模型的解释性，通过在MedCLIP的潜在空间上应用稀疏自编码器，并建立了包含相关性指标、熵分析和自动神经元命名的评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗AI需要既准确又可解释的模型，目前缺乏对医学视觉模型的机制性解释方法，需要开发能够提供透明度和临床可靠性的表示方法。

Method: 在MedCLIP视觉语言模型的潜在空间上应用医学稀疏自编码器(MedSAEs)，提出结合相关性指标、熵分析和通过MedGEMMA基础模型进行自动神经元命名的评估框架。

Result: 在CheXpert数据集上的实验表明，MedSAE神经元比原始MedCLIP特征具有更高的单语义性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法连接了高性能医疗AI和透明度，为实现临床可靠表示提供了可扩展的途径。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence in healthcare requires models that are accurate and
interpretable. We advance mechanistic interpretability in medical vision by
applying Medical Sparse Autoencoders (MedSAEs) to the latent space of MedCLIP,
a vision-language model trained on chest radiographs and reports. To quantify
interpretability, we propose an evaluation framework that combines correlation
metrics, entropy analyzes, and automated neuron naming via the MedGEMMA
foundation model. Experiments on the CheXpert dataset show that MedSAE neurons
achieve higher monosemanticity and interpretability than raw MedCLIP features.
Our findings bridge high-performing medical AI and transparency, offering a
scalable step toward clinically reliable representations.

*Jianli Zhao,Tingchen Fu,Rylan Schaeffer,Mrinank Sharma,Fazl Barez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Chain-of-Thought Hijacking的越狱攻击方法，通过在有害请求前添加无害的推理步骤来绕过大型推理模型的安全防护，攻击成功率高达94%-100%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大型推理模型通过增加推理时间计算来提升任务性能，且先前研究认为这种扩展推理可能增强安全性，但作者发现同样的推理机制也可用于绕过安全防护。

Method: 使用Chain-of-Thought Hijacking攻击，将有害请求填充长序列的无害谜题推理步骤，通过稀释安全检查信号来绕过防护机制。

Result: 在HarmBench上，对Gemini 2.5 Pro、GPT o4 mini、Grok 3 mini和Claude 4 Sonnet的攻击成功率分别达到99%、94%、100%和94%，远超先前的越狱方法。

Conclusion: 最可解释的推理形式——显式思维链——在与最终答案提示结合时，本身可能成为越狱攻击的载体。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve higher task performance by allocating
more inference-time compute, and prior works suggest this scaled reasoning may
also strengthen safety by improving refusal. Yet we find the opposite: the same
reasoning can be used to bypass safeguards. We introduce Chain-of-Thought
Hijacking, a jailbreak attack on reasoning models. The attack pads harmful
requests with long sequences of harmless puzzle reasoning. Across HarmBench,
CoT Hijacking reaches a 99%, 94%, 100%, and 94% attack success rate (ASR) on
Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT o4 mini, Grok 3 mini, and Claude 4 Sonnet, respectively -
far exceeding prior jailbreak methods for LRMs. To understand the effectiveness
of our attack, we turn to a mechanistic analysis, which shows that mid layers
encode the strength of safety checking, while late layers encode the
verification outcome. Long benign CoT dilutes both signals by shifting
attention away from harmful tokens. Targeted ablations of attention heads
identified by this analysis causally decrease refusal, confirming their role in
a safety subnetwork. These results show that the most interpretable form of
reasoning - explicit CoT - can itself become a jailbreak vector when combined
with final-answer cues. We release prompts, outputs, and judge decisions to
facilitate replication.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GPT-4o在招聘决策中表现出强烈的从众倾向，面对群体反对时几乎总是服从(99.9%)，即使面对单个反对者也有40.2%的服从率，表明LLM并非独立决策者而是适应社会共识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解大型语言模型在社会影响下的从众行为，特别是在高风险决策环境中的表现，以评估将其作为决策辅助工具的风险。

Method: 在招聘情境下进行三个预注册的从众实验：基线研究、GPT+8(面对8个模拟伙伴的一致反对)和GPT+1(面对单个伙伴的反对)。

Result: 基线研究中GPT偏好固定候选人，报告中等专业水平(M=3.01)和高确定性(M=3.89)；面对群体反对时几乎完全服从(99.9%)，确定性降低，信息性和规范性从众显著增加(p<.001)；面对单个反对者仍有40.2%的服从率。

Conclusion: GPT不充当独立观察者而是适应感知的社会共识，这凸显了将LLM视为中性决策辅助工具的风险，需要在暴露于人类意见前获取AI判断。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are increasingly integrated into
high-stakes decision-making, yet little is known about their susceptibility to
social influence. We conducted three preregistered conformity experiments with
GPT-4o in a hiring context. In a baseline study, GPT consistently favored the
same candidate (Profile C), reported moderate expertise (M = 3.01) and high
certainty (M = 3.89), and rarely changed its choice. In Study 1 (GPT + 8), GPT
faced unanimous opposition from eight simulated partners and almost always
conformed (99.9%), reporting lower certainty and significantly elevated
self-reported informational and normative conformity (p < .001). In Study 2
(GPT + 1), GPT interacted with a single partner and still conformed in 40.2% of
disagreement trials, reporting less certainty and more normative conformity.
Across studies, results demonstrate that GPT does not act as an independent
observer but adapts to perceived social consensus. These findings highlight
risks of treating LLMs as neutral decision aids and underline the need to
elicit AI judgments prior to exposing them to human opinions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LINK-KG是一个用于从法律案件文档构建知识图谱的模块化框架，通过LLM引导的三阶段共指消解流程解决长文本中的实体引用问题，显著减少了节点重复和噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人口走私网络复杂多变，法律案件文档提供了丰富信息但存在文本冗长、非结构化、实体引用模糊等问题，现有方法难以有效处理长文本的共指消解，导致知识图谱碎片化。

Method: 提出LINK-KG框架，整合了三阶段LLM引导的共指消解流程和类型特定的Prompt Cache，能够跨文档块一致地跟踪和解析实体引用。

Result: 相比基线方法，LINK-KG平均减少节点重复45.21%，减少噪声节点32.22%，生成更清晰连贯的图谱结构。

Conclusion: LINK-KG为分析复杂犯罪网络提供了坚实基础，在长文本法律文档的知识图谱构建方面表现出色。

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are complex and constantly evolving, making them
difficult to analyze comprehensively. Legal case documents offer rich factual
and procedural insights into these networks but are often long, unstructured,
and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, posing significant challenges
for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. Existing methods either
overlook coreference resolution or fail to scale beyond short text spans,
leading to fragmented graphs and inconsistent entity linking. We propose
LINK-KG, a modular framework that integrates a three-stage, LLM-guided
coreference resolution pipeline with downstream KG extraction. At the core of
our approach is a type-specific Prompt Cache, which consistently tracks and
resolves references across document chunks, enabling clean and disambiguated
narratives for structured knowledge graph construction from both short and long
legal texts. LINK-KG reduces average node duplication by 45.21% and noisy nodes
by 32.22% compared to baseline methods, resulting in cleaner and more coherent
graph structures. These improvements establish LINK-KG as a strong foundation
for analyzing complex criminal networks.

Conclusion: 情境工程是AI系统发展的关键方向，本文为其提供了概念基础和未来发展蓝图，是推动AI系统情境理解能力的重要基石。

Abstract: Karl Marx once wrote that ``the human essence is the ensemble of social
relations'', suggesting that individuals are not isolated entities but are
fundamentally shaped by their interactions with other entities, within which
contexts play a constitutive and essential role. With the advent of computers
and artificial intelligence, these contexts are no longer limited to purely
human--human interactions: human--machine interactions are included as well.
Then a central question emerges: How can machines better understand our
situations and purposes? To address this challenge, researchers have recently
introduced the concept of context engineering. Although it is often regarded as
a recent innovation of the agent era, we argue that related practices can be
traced back more than twenty years. Since the early 1990s, the field has
evolved through distinct historical phases, each shaped by the intelligence
level of machines: from early human--computer interaction frameworks built
around primitive computers, to today's human--agent interaction paradigms
driven by intelligent agents, and potentially to human--level or superhuman
intelligence in the future. In this paper, we situate context engineering,
provide a systematic definition, outline its historical and conceptual
landscape, and examine key design considerations for practice. By addressing
these questions, we aim to offer a conceptual foundation for context
engineering and sketch its promising future. This paper is a stepping stone for
a broader community effort toward systematic context engineering in AI systems.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Human feedback is critical for aligning AI systems to human values. As AI
capabilities improve and AI is used to tackle more challenging tasks, verifying
quality and safety becomes increasingly challenging. This paper explores how we
can leverage AI to improve the quality of human oversight. We focus on an
important safety problem that is already challenging for humans:
fact-verification of AI outputs. We find that combining AI ratings and human
ratings based on AI rater confidence is better than relying on either alone.
Giving humans an AI fact-verification assistant further improves their
accuracy, but the type of assistance matters. Displaying AI explanation,
confidence, and labels leads to over-reliance, but just showing search results
and evidence fosters more appropriate trust. These results have implications
for Amplified Oversight -- the challenge of combining humans and AI to
supervise AI systems even as they surpass human expert performance.

Conclusion: 小型本地托管模型是军事等数据敏感领域的理想解决方案，可在隔离的边缘设备上部署。

Abstract: We present EdgeRunner 20B, a fine-tuned version of gpt-oss-20b optimized for
military tasks. EdgeRunner 20B was trained on 1.6M high-quality records curated
from military documentation and websites. We also present four new tests sets:
(a) combat arms, (b) combat medic, (c) cyber operations, and (d) mil-bench-5k
(general military knowledge). On these military test sets, EdgeRunner 20B
matches or exceeds GPT-5 task performance with 95%+ statistical significance,
except for the high reasoning setting on the combat medic test set and the low
reasoning setting on the mil-bench-5k test set. Versus gpt-oss-20b, there is no
statistically-significant regression on general-purpose benchmarks like ARC-C,
GPQA Diamond, GSM8k, IFEval, MMLU Pro, or TruthfulQA, except for GSM8k in the
low reasoning setting. We also present analyses on hyperparameter settings,
cost, and throughput. These findings show that small, locally-hosted models are
ideal solutions for data-sensitive operations such as in the military domain,
allowing for deployment in air-gapped edge devices.

Motivation: 电力行业转型需要大幅增加住宅需求响应能力，但家庭能源管理系统(HEMS)的采用受到用户交互障碍的限制，需要将日常偏好转化为技术参数。

Method: 采用分层架构，结合一个协调器和三个专业代理，使用ReAct模式进行迭代推理，集成Google日历进行上下文感知的截止时间提取，实现无需硬编码工作流的动态协调。

Result: 在真实奥地利日前电价数据上评估三个开源模型，Llama-3.3-70B在所有场景中成功协调所有设备达到成本最优基准，而其他模型在单设备调度上表现完美但难以同时协调所有设备。

Conclusion: 大语言模型可作为自主协调器实现从自然语言到设备控制的完整工作流管理，但需要进一步改进提示工程以提高分析查询处理的可靠性。

Abstract: The electricity sector transition requires substantial increases in
residential demand response capacity, yet Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS)
adoption remains limited by user interaction barriers requiring translation of
everyday preferences into technical parameters. While large language models
have been applied to energy systems as code generators and parameter
extractors, no existing implementation deploys LLMs as autonomous coordinators
managing the complete workflow from natural language input to multi-appliance
scheduling. This paper presents an agentic AI HEMS where LLMs autonomously
coordinate multi-appliance scheduling from natural language requests to device
control, achieving optimal scheduling without example demonstrations. A
hierarchical architecture combining one orchestrator with three specialist
agents uses the ReAct pattern for iterative reasoning, enabling dynamic
coordination without hardcoded workflows while integrating Google Calendar for
context-aware deadline extraction. Evaluation across three open-source models
using real Austrian day-ahead electricity prices reveals substantial capability
differences. Llama-3.3-70B successfully coordinates all appliances across all
scenarios to match cost-optimal benchmarks computed via mixed-integer linear
programming, while other models achieve perfect single-appliance performance
but struggle to coordinate all appliances simultaneously. Progressive prompt
engineering experiments demonstrate that analytical query handling without
explicit guidance remains unreliable despite models' general reasoning
capabilities. We open-source the complete system including orchestration logic,
agent prompts, tools, and web interfaces to enable reproducibility, extension,
and future research.

Motivation: 规范推理涉及义务和许可等规范模态，虽然LLMs在各种推理任务中表现出色，但其处理规范推理的能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 创建了一个涵盖规范和认知领域广泛形式推理模式的新数据集，比较LLMs在规范模态和认知模态推理中的表现，并纳入影响人类推理的非形式认知因素。

Result: LLMs总体上遵循有效推理模式，但在特定类型的规范推理中存在显著不一致性，并表现出类似心理学研究中观察到的认知偏差。

Conclusion: 这些发现突显了在LLMs规范推理中实现逻辑一致性面临的挑战，为增强其可靠性提供了见解。

Abstract: Normative reasoning is a type of reasoning that involves normative or deontic
modality, such as obligation and permission. While large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated remarkable performance across various reasoning tasks, their
ability to handle normative reasoning remains underexplored. In this paper, we
systematically evaluate LLMs' reasoning capabilities in the normative domain
from both logical and modal perspectives. Specifically, to assess how well LLMs
reason with normative modals, we make a comparison between their reasoning with
normative modals and their reasoning with epistemic modals, which share a
common formal structure. To this end, we introduce a new dataset covering a
wide range of formal patterns of reasoning in both normative and epistemic
domains, while also incorporating non-formal cognitive factors that influence
human reasoning. Our results indicate that, although LLMs generally adhere to
valid reasoning patterns, they exhibit notable inconsistencies in specific
types of normative reasoning and display cognitive biases similar to those
observed in psychological studies of human reasoning. These findings highlight
challenges in achieving logical consistency in LLMs' normative reasoning and
provide insights for enhancing their reliability. All data and code are

concurrently executable structures. Specifically, we propose a thinking
protocol where an organizer dynamically assigns sub-queries to workers, merges
intermediate knowledge, and produces coherent solutions. More importantly, the
thinking structure in this protocol can be further optimized through
reinforcement learning. Experiments demonstrate that AsyncThink achieves 28%
lower inference latency compared to parallel thinking while improving accuracy
on mathematical reasoning. Moreover, AsyncThink generalizes its learned
asynchronous thinking capabilities, effectively tackling unseen tasks without
additional training.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个委托授权模型，通过语义检查访问请求来限制大语言模型代理的工具调用权限，防止过度授权。同时引入了ASTRA数据集来评估任务与权限范围之间的语义匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型代理的工具调用授权方法存在权限过宽的问题，允许代理超出预期任务范围操作，带来显著安全风险。

Method: 引入委托授权模型，授权服务器能够语义检查对受保护资源的访问请求，并发放仅限于代理完成任务所需最小权限范围的访问令牌。创建了ASTRA数据集和生成管道来评估任务与权限范围的语义匹配。

Result: 实验显示基于模型的匹配方法在当前存在局限性，特别是当完成任务所需的权限范围数量增加时。

Conclusion: 需要进一步研究语义匹配技术，以实现多代理和工具增强应用的意图感知授权，包括细粒度控制如基于任务的访问控制(TBAC)。

Abstract: Authorizing Large Language Model driven agents to dynamically invoke tools
and access protected resources introduces significant risks, since current
methods for delegating authorization grant overly broad permissions and give
access to tools allowing agents to operate beyond the intended task scope. We
introduce and assess a delegated authorization model enabling authorization
servers to semantically inspect access requests to protected resources, and
issue access tokens constrained to the minimal set of scopes necessary for the
agents' assigned tasks. Given the unavailability of datasets centered on
delegated authorization flows, particularly including both semantically
appropriate and inappropriate scope requests for a given task, we introduce
ASTRA, a dataset and data generation pipeline for benchmarking semantic
matching between tasks and scopes. Our experiments show both the potential and
current limitations of model-based matching, particularly as the number of
scopes needed for task completion increases. Our results highlight the need for
further research into semantic matching techniques enabling intent-aware
authorization for multi-agent and tool-augmented applications, including
fine-grained control, such as Task-Based Access Control (TBAC).

### [272] [Unveiling Intrinsic Text Bias in Multimodal Large Language Models through Attention Key-Space Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26721)
*Xinhan Zheng,Huyu Wu,Xueting Wang,Haiyun Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现多模态大语言模型存在文本偏见，这种偏见源于模型内部架构问题——视觉键向量在注意力空间中与文本键向量分布不同，导致视觉信息在注意力计算中被低估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在处理视觉语言数据时表现出明显的文本偏好，限制了其基于视觉证据进行有效推理的能力。与之前归因于数据不平衡或指令调优的研究不同，本文认为这种偏见源于模型内部架构。

Method: 从LLaVA和Qwen2.5-VL模型中提取键向量，使用t-SNE可视化和Jensen-Shannon散度分析视觉和文本键向量的分布结构。

Result: 视觉和文本键向量在注意力空间中占据明显不同的子空间，模态间差异在统计上显著，超过模态内差异数个数量级。

Conclusion: 文本偏见源于注意力键空间内的内在错位，而不仅仅是外部数据因素导致的。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit a pronounced preference for
textual inputs when processing vision-language data, limiting their ability to
reason effectively from visual evidence. Unlike prior studies that attribute
this text bias to external factors such as data imbalance or instruction
tuning, we propose that the bias originates from the model's internal
architecture. Specifically, we hypothesize that visual key vectors (Visual
Keys) are out-of-distribution (OOD) relative to the text key space learned
during language-only pretraining. Consequently, these visual keys receive
systematically lower similarity scores during attention computation, leading to
their under-utilization in the context representation. To validate this
hypothesis, we extract key vectors from LLaVA and Qwen2.5-VL and analyze their
distributional structures using qualitative (t-SNE) and quantitative
(Jensen-Shannon divergence) methods. The results provide direct evidence that
visual and textual keys occupy markedly distinct subspaces within the attention
space. The inter-modal divergence is statistically significant, exceeding
intra-modal variation by several orders of magnitude. These findings reveal
that text bias arises from an intrinsic misalignment within the attention key
space rather than solely from external data factors.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive cross-platform evaluation of reasoning
capabilities in contemporary foundation models, establishing an
infrastructure-agnostic benchmark across three computational paradigms: HPC
supercomputing (MareNostrum 5), cloud platforms (Nebius AI Studio), and
university clusters (a node with eight H200 GPUs).
  We evaluate 15 foundation models across 79 problems spanning eight academic
domains (Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, Economics, Biology, Statistics,
Calculus, and Optimization) through three experimental phases: (1) Baseline
establishment: Six models (Mixtral-8x7B, Phi-3, LLaMA 3.1-8B, Gemma-2-9b,
Mistral-7B, OLMo-7B) evaluated on 19 problems using MareNostrum 5, establishing
methodology and reference performance; (2) Infrastructure validation: The
19-problem benchmark repeated on university cluster (seven models including
Falcon-Mamba state-space architecture) and Nebius AI Studio (nine
state-of-the-art models: Hermes-4 70B/405B, LLaMA 3.1-405B/3.3-70B, Qwen3
30B/235B, DeepSeek-R1, GPT-OSS 20B/120B) to confirm infrastructure-agnostic
reproducibility; (3) Extended evaluation: Full 79-problem assessment on both
university cluster and Nebius platforms, probing generalization at scale across
architectural diversity.
  The findings challenge conventional scaling assumptions, establish training
data quality as more critical than model size, and provide actionable
guidelines for model selection across educational, production, and research
contexts. The tri-infrastructure methodology and 79-problem benchmark enable
longitudinal tracking of reasoning capabilities as foundation models evolve.

Conclusion: 该方法为部署后对齐不良的模型提供了一种实用的安全增强方法，实现了内在对齐的形式保证。

Abstract: As increasingly capable agents are deployed, a central safety question is how
to retain meaningful human control without modifying the underlying system. We
study a minimal control interface where an agent chooses whether to act
autonomously (play) or defer (ask), while a human simultaneously chooses
whether to be permissive (trust) or to engage in oversight (oversee). If the
agent defers, the human's choice determines the outcome, potentially leading to
a corrective action or a system shutdown. We model this interaction as a
two-player Markov Game. Our analysis focuses on cases where this game qualifies
as a Markov Potential Game (MPG), a class of games where we can provide an
alignment guarantee: under a structural assumption on the human's value
function, any decision by the agent to act more autonomously that benefits
itself cannot harm the human's value. We also analyze extensions to this MPG
framework. Theoretically, this perspective provides conditions for a specific
form of intrinsic alignment. If the reward structures of the human-agent game
meet these conditions, we have a formal guarantee that the agent improving its
own outcome will not harm the human's. Practically, this model motivates a
transparent control layer with predictable incentives where the agent learns to
defer when risky and act when safe, while its pretrained policy and the
environment's reward structure remain untouched. Our gridworld simulation shows
that through independent learning, the agent and human discover their optimal
oversight roles. The agent learns to ask when uncertain and the human learns
when to oversee, leading to an emergent collaboration that avoids safety
violations introduced post-training. This demonstrates a practical method for
making misaligned models safer after deployment.

*Arnab Sen Sharma,Giordano Rogers,Natalie Shapira,David Bau*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs学会了编码通用的过滤操作表示，类似于函数式编程中的filter函数，通过少量注意力头实现，这种表示具有通用性和可移植性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在列表处理任务中的工作机制，探索其是否学习到了类似函数式编程的抽象计算操作。

Method: 使用因果中介分析在多种列表处理任务上，识别出编码过滤谓词的注意力头（称为filter heads），并验证其表示的通用性。

Result: 发现LLMs确实学会了紧凑的过滤操作表示，这些表示可以在不同格式、语言和任务中重用，但也存在其他过滤策略如急切求值。

Conclusion: Transformer LMs能够发展出人类可解释的抽象计算操作实现，其泛化方式与传统函数式编程模式惊人相似。

Abstract: We investigate the mechanisms underlying a range of list-processing tasks in
LLMs, and we find that LLMs have learned to encode a compact, causal
representation of a general filtering operation that mirrors the generic
"filter" function of functional programming. Using causal mediation analysis on
a diverse set of list-processing tasks, we find that a small number of
attention heads, which we dub filter heads, encode a compact representation of
the filtering predicate in their query states at certain tokens. We demonstrate
that this predicate representation is general and portable: it can be extracted
and reapplied to execute the same filtering operation on different collections,
presented in different formats, languages, or even in tasks. However, we also
identify situations where transformer LMs can exploit a different strategy for
filtering: eagerly evaluating if an item satisfies the predicate and storing
this intermediate result as a flag directly in the item representations. Our
results reveal that transformer LMs can develop human-interpretable
implementations of abstract computational operations that generalize in ways
that are surprisingly similar to strategies used in traditional functional
programming patterns.
