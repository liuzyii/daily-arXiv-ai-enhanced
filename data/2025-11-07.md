### [1] [Near-Lossless 3D Voxel Representation Free from Iso-surface](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04029)
*Yihao Luo,Xianglong He,Chuanyu Pan,Yiwen Chen,Jiaqi Wu,Yangguang Li,Wanli Ouyang,Yuanming Hu,Guang Yang,ChoonHwai Yap*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Faithful Contouring是一种稀疏体素化表示方法，支持2048+分辨率，无需将网格转换为场函数或提取等值面，实现了近乎无损的几何保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于等值面的体素化表示严重依赖水密化或渲染优化，这不可避免地会损害几何保真度。

Method: 提出Faithful Contouring稀疏体素化表示，并设计双模式自编码器用于可扩展且保留细节的形状重建。

Result: 在直接表示方面达到10^-5级别的距离误差；在网格重建方面，Chamfer距离减少93%，F-score提高35%。

Conclusion: Faithful Contouring在3D学习任务中作为表示方法具有卓越的保真度，在准确性和效率方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient voxelized representations of 3D meshes are the
foundation of 3D reconstruction and generation. However, existing
representations based on iso-surface heavily rely on water-tightening or
rendering optimization, which inevitably compromise geometric fidelity. We
propose Faithful Contouring, a sparse voxelized representation that supports
2048+ resolutions for arbitrary meshes, requiring neither converting meshes to
field functions nor extracting the isosurface during remeshing. It achieves
near-lossless fidelity by preserving sharpness and internal structures, even
for challenging cases with complex geometry and topology. The proposed method
also shows flexibility for texturing, manipulation, and editing. Beyond
representation, we design a dual-mode autoencoder for Faithful Contouring,
enabling scalable and detail-preserving shape reconstruction. Extensive
experiments show that Faithful Contouring surpasses existing methods in
accuracy and efficiency for both representation and reconstruction. For direct
representation, it achieves distance errors at the $10^{-5}$ level; for mesh
reconstruction, it yields a 93\% reduction in Chamfer Distance and a 35\%
improvement in F-score over strong baselines, confirming superior fidelity as a
representation for 3D learning tasks.

### [2] [LoRA-Edge: Tensor-Train-Assisted LoRA for Practical CNN Fine-Tuning on Edge Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03765)
*Hyunseok Kwak,Kyeongwon Lee,Jae-Jin Lee,Woojoo Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoRA-Edge是一种参数高效微调方法，基于低秩适应和Tensor-Train分解，用于边缘设备上CNN的轻量级微调，显著减少可训练参数数量同时保持接近全微调的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘设备上CNN的完全微调在严格的内存、计算和能耗预算下不可行，需要参数高效的微调方法来应对领域偏移问题。

Method: 对预训练卷积层应用Tensor-Train SVD分解，选择性更新输出侧核心并采用零初始化，最后将更新融合回密集核中，保持推理成本不变。

Result: 在多个HAR数据集和CNN骨干网络上，LoRA-Edge仅更新最多1.49%的参数就能达到全微调精度4.7%以内的性能，在Jetson Orin Nano上实现1.4-3.8倍的收敛加速。

Conclusion: LoRA-Edge使得结构对齐、参数高效的设备端CNN适应在边缘平台上变得实用可行。

Abstract: On-device fine-tuning of CNNs is essential to withstand domain shift in edge
applications such as Human Activity Recognition (HAR), yet full fine-tuning is
infeasible under strict memory, compute, and energy budgets. We present
LoRA-Edge, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method that builds on
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with tensor-train assistance. LoRA-Edge (i) applies
Tensor-Train Singular Value Decomposition (TT-SVD) to pre-trained convolutional
layers, (ii) selectively updates only the output-side core with
zero-initialization to keep the auxiliary path inactive at the start, and (iii)
fuses the update back into dense kernels, leaving inference cost unchanged.
This design preserves convolutional structure and reduces the number of
trainable parameters by up to two orders of magnitude compared to full
fine-tuning. Across diverse HAR datasets and CNN backbones, LoRA-Edge achieves
accuracy within 4.7% of full fine-tuning while updating at most 1.49% of
parameters, consistently outperforming prior parameter-efficient baselines
under similar budgets. On a Jetson Orin Nano, TT-SVD initialization and
selective-core training yield 1.4-3.8x faster convergence to target F1.
LoRA-Edge thus makes structure-aligned, parameter-efficient on-device CNN
adaptation practical for edge platforms.

### [3] [SILVI: Simple Interface for Labeling Video Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03819)
*Ozan Kanbertay,Richard Vogg,Elif Karakoc,Peter M. Kappeler,Claudia Fichtel,Alexander S. Ecker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SILVI是一个开源标注软件，用于在视频数据中标注行为和互动，填补了现有工具在互动标注方面的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源标注工具要么支持行为标注但不定位个体，要么支持定位但不捕捉互动，无法满足理解社交和个体化动物行为的需求。

Method: 开发SILVI软件，整合行为和互动标注功能，直接在视频数据中标注，生成适合训练和验证计算机视觉模型的结构化输出。

Result: SILVI能够标注行为和互动，连接行为生态学和计算机视觉，促进细粒度行为分析的自动化方法发展。

Conclusion: SILVI填补了互动标注工具的空白，不仅适用于动物行为研究，也可用于标注其他需要提取动态场景图的人类互动视频。

Abstract: Computer vision methods are increasingly used for the automated analysis of
large volumes of video data collected through camera traps, drones, or direct
observations of animals in the wild. While recent advances have focused
primarily on detecting individual actions, much less work has addressed the
detection and annotation of interactions -- a crucial aspect for understanding
social and individualized animal behavior. Existing open-source annotation
tools support either behavioral labeling without localization of individuals,
or localization without the capacity to capture interactions. To bridge this
gap, we present SILVI, an open-source labeling software that integrates both
functionalities. SILVI enables researchers to annotate behaviors and
interactions directly within video data, generating structured outputs suitable
for training and validating computer vision models. By linking behavioral
ecology with computer vision, SILVI facilitates the development of automated
approaches for fine-grained behavioral analyses. Although developed primarily
in the context of animal behavior, SILVI could be useful more broadly to
annotate human interactions in other videos that require extracting dynamic
scene graphs. The software, along with documentation and download instructions,
is available at: https://gitlab.gwdg.de/kanbertay/interaction-labelling-app.

### [4] [Noise Injection: Improving Out-of-Distribution Generalization for Limited Size Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03855)
*Duong Mai,Lawrence Hall*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在训练过程中使用基础噪声注入技术（高斯、散斑、泊松和椒盐噪声）来提高COVID-19胸部X光检测模型对分布外数据的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在图像识别中容易学习特定来源的伪影而非合理生物标志物，导致无法泛化到来自不同设备、人群的分布外数据，特别是在COVID-19胸部X光检测中表现明显。

Method: 在训练过程中应用四种基础噪声注入技术：高斯噪声、散斑噪声、泊松噪声和椒盐噪声，以增强模型对分布变化的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验结果表明，噪声注入技术能够显著减小分布内和分布外评估之间的性能差距，从0.10-0.20降低到0.01-0.06（基于AUC、F1、准确率、召回率和特异性等关键指标在十个随机种子上的平均结果）。

Conclusion: 基础噪声注入技术是提高COVID-19胸部X光检测模型对分布外数据泛化能力的有效方法，能够减少模型对特定来源伪影的依赖。

Abstract: Deep learned (DL) models for image recognition have been shown to fail to
generalize to data from different devices, populations, etc. COVID-19 detection
from Chest X-rays (CXRs), in particular, has been shown to fail to generalize
to out-of-distribution (OOD) data from new clinical sources not covered in the
training set. This occurs because models learn to exploit shortcuts -
source-specific artifacts that do not translate to new distributions - rather
than reasonable biomarkers to maximize performance on in-distribution (ID)
data. Rendering the models more robust to distribution shifts, our study
investigates the use of fundamental noise injection techniques (Gaussian,
Speckle, Poisson, and Salt and Pepper) during training. Our empirical results
demonstrate that this technique can significantly reduce the performance gap
between ID and OOD evaluation from 0.10-0.20 to 0.01-0.06, based on results
averaged over ten random seeds across key metrics such as AUC, F1, accuracy,
recall and specificity. Our source code is publicly available at

### [5] [Investigating Robot Control Policy Learning for Autonomous X-ray-guided Spine Procedures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03882)
*Florence Klitzner,Blanca Inigo,Benjamin D. Killeen,Lalithkumar Seenivasan,Michelle Song,Axel Krieger,Mathias Unberath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究探索了基于模仿学习的机器人控制策略在X射线引导脊柱手术中的应用，开发了一个高真实度的仿真环境，训练了仅基于视觉信息的插管对齐策略，在68.5%的情况下首次尝试成功，并展示了良好的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究模仿学习在X射线引导脊柱手术中的适用性，因为多视角X射线图像解释复杂，传统方法面临挑战，需要探索新的机器人控制方法。

Method: 开发了高真实度的X射线引导脊柱手术仿真环境，收集了正确轨迹和对应双平面X射线序列数据集，训练了基于视觉信息的模仿学习策略，用于规划和开环控制插管对齐。

Result: 策略在68.5%的情况下首次尝试成功，能够保持安全的椎弓根内轨迹，对复杂解剖结构（包括骨折）具有良好泛化能力，对不同的初始化条件保持鲁棒性，在真实X射线图像上也能产生合理轨迹。

Conclusion: 虽然初步结果有前景，但在入口点精度方面存在局限，完全闭环控制需要更频繁的反馈机制。通过更强的先验知识和领域知识，这类模型可能为未来轻量级、无需CT的机器人术中脊柱导航提供基础。

Abstract: Imitation learning-based robot control policies are enjoying renewed interest
in video-based robotics. However, it remains unclear whether this approach
applies to X-ray-guided procedures, such as spine instrumentation. This is
because interpretation of multi-view X-rays is complex. We examine
opportunities and challenges for imitation policy learning in bi-plane-guided
cannula insertion. We develop an in silico sandbox for scalable, automated
simulation of X-ray-guided spine procedures with a high degree of realism. We
curate a dataset of correct trajectories and corresponding bi-planar X-ray
sequences that emulate the stepwise alignment of providers. We then train
imitation learning policies for planning and open-loop control that iteratively
align a cannula solely based on visual information. This precisely controlled
setup offers insights into limitations and capabilities of this method. Our
policy succeeded on the first attempt in 68.5% of cases, maintaining safe
intra-pedicular trajectories across diverse vertebral levels. The policy
generalized to complex anatomy, including fractures, and remained robust to
varied initializations. Rollouts on real bi-planar X-rays further suggest that
the model can produce plausible trajectories, despite training exclusively in
simulation. While these preliminary results are promising, we also identify
limitations, especially in entry point precision. Full closed-look control will
require additional considerations around how to provide sufficiently frequent
feedback. With more robust priors and domain knowledge, such models may provide
a foundation for future efforts toward lightweight and CT-free robotic
intra-operative spinal navigation.

### [6] [Desert Waste Detection and Classification Using Data-Based and Model-Based Enhanced YOLOv12 DL Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03888)
*Abdulmumin Sa'ad,Sulaimon Oyeniyi Adebayo,Abdul Jabbar Siddiqui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于YOLOv12的轻量级实时目标检测框架，结合自对抗训练和专用数据增强策略，用于沙漠环境中的垃圾检测，在精度和效率方面取得显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球废物危机日益严重，传统垃圾收集方法在偏远或恶劣环境（如沙漠）中效率低下且危险。现有研究主要关注城市环境和可回收材料，忽视了有机和危险废物以及沙漠等未充分探索的地形。

Method: 基于剪枝的轻量版YOLOv12，集成自对抗训练（SAT）和专用数据增强策略，使用DroneTrashNet数据集进行训练。

Result: 在精度、召回率和平均精度（mAP）方面显著提升，同时实现低延迟和小模型尺寸，适合在资源受限的无人机上部署。与最先进的轻量级YOLO变体相比，在准确性和效率方面达到最佳平衡。

Conclusion: 结合数据中心和模型中心增强方法对于在沙漠环境中实现鲁棒的实时垃圾检测是有效的。

Abstract: The global waste crisis is escalating, with solid waste generation expected
to increase by 70% by 2050. Traditional waste collection methods, particularly
in remote or harsh environments like deserts, are labor-intensive, inefficient,
and often hazardous. Recent advances in computer vision and deep learning have
opened the door to automated waste detection systems, yet most research focuses
on urban environments and recyclable materials, overlooking organic and
hazardous waste and underexplored terrains such as deserts. In this work, we
propose an enhanced real-time object detection framework based on a pruned,
lightweight version of YOLOv12 integrated with Self-Adversarial Training (SAT)
and specialized data augmentation strategies. Using the DroneTrashNet dataset,
we demonstrate significant improvements in precision, recall, and mean average
precision (mAP), while achieving low latency and compact model size suitable
for deployment on resource-constrained aerial drones. Benchmarking our model
against state-of-the-art lightweight YOLO variants further highlights its
optimal balance of accuracy and efficiency. Our results validate the
effectiveness of combining data-centric and model-centric enhancements for
robust, real-time waste detection in desert environments.

### [7] [Improving Diagnostic Performance on Small and Imbalanced Datasets Using Class-Based Input Image Composition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03891)
*Hlali Azzeddine,Majid Ben Yakhlef,Soulaiman El Hazzat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于类别的图像合成方法，通过将同类多张图像融合成复合图像来增强训练样本的信息密度和类内方差，显著提升模型在小型不平衡数据集上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小型不平衡数据集和低质量输入图像导致深度学习模型高误报率的问题，特别是在医学影像诊断中。

Method: 使用类基图像合成方法，将同类多张图像融合成3x1布局的复合图像(CoImg)，构建平衡数据集Co-OCTDL，并与原始数据集进行对比实验。

Result: 在OCT视网膜扫描数据集上，该方法实现了近乎完美的准确率(99.6%)、F1分数(0.995)和AUC(0.9996)，显著降低了误报率。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理类别不平衡和小样本问题，即使在弱数据集上也能产生高质量的预测结果。

Abstract: Small, imbalanced datasets and poor input image quality can lead to high
false predictions rates with deep learning models. This paper introduces
Class-Based Image Composition, an approach that allows us to reformulate
training inputs through a fusion of multiple images of the same class into
combined visual composites, named Composite Input Images (CoImg). That enhances
the intra-class variance and improves the valuable information density per
training sample and increases the ability of the model to distinguish between
subtle disease patterns. Our method was evaluated on the Optical Coherence
Tomography Dataset for Image-Based Deep Learning Methods (OCTDL) (Kulyabin et
al., 2024), which contains 2,064 high-resolution optical coherence tomography
(OCT) scans of the human retina, representing seven distinct diseases with a
significant class imbalance. We constructed a perfectly class-balanced version
of this dataset, named Co-OCTDL, where each scan is resented as a 3x1 layout
composite image. To assess the effectiveness of this new representation, we
conducted a comparative analysis between the original dataset and its variant
using a VGG16 model. A fair comparison was ensured by utilizing the identical
model architecture and hyperparameters for all experiments. The proposed
approach markedly improved diagnostic results.The enhanced Dataset achieved
near-perfect accuracy (99.6%) with F1-score (0.995) and AUC (0.9996), compared
to a baseline model trained on raw dataset. The false prediction rate was also
significantly lower, this demonstrates that the method can producehigh-quality
predictions even for weak datasets affected by class imbalance or small sample
size.

### [8] [I Detect What I Don't Know: Incremental Anomaly Learning with Stochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian for Oracle-Free Medical Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03912)
*Nand Kumar Yadav,Rodrigue Rizk,William CW Chen,KC Santosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种无监督、无需专家标注的医学图像异常检测框架，通过增量扩展正常样本集，结合轻量级适配器更新和不确定性门控样本准入机制，实现高效的异常检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像异常检测面临标注异常样本稀缺和专家监督成本高的问题，需要开发无需异常标签的无监督方法。

Method: 使用预训练视觉主干网络配合微小卷积适配器进行快速领域适应，通过k近邻异常评分和双重概率门控机制（距离z-score阈值和SWAG认知不确定性）确保样本安全准入。

Result: 在多个医学图像数据集上显著提升性能：COVID-CXR的ROC-AUC从0.9489提升至0.9982，Pneumonia CXR从0.6834提升至0.8968，Brain MRI ND-5从0.6041提升至0.7269。

Conclusion: 该框架在标签稀缺的医学成像应用中表现出高效性和有效性，能够持续优化正常性概念而无需依赖生成重建或重放缓冲区。

Abstract: Unknown anomaly detection in medical imaging remains a fundamental challenge
due to the scarcity of labeled anomalies and the high cost of expert
supervision. We introduce an unsupervised, oracle-free framework that
incrementally expands a trusted set of normal samples without any anomaly
labels. Starting from a small, verified seed of normal images, our method
alternates between lightweight adapter updates and uncertainty-gated sample
admission. A frozen pretrained vision backbone is augmented with tiny
convolutional adapters, ensuring rapid domain adaptation with negligible
computational overhead. Extracted embeddings are stored in a compact coreset
enabling efficient k-nearest neighbor anomaly (k-NN) scoring. Safety during
incremental expansion is enforced by dual probabilistic gates, a sample is
admitted into the normal memory only if its distance to the existing coreset
lies within a calibrated z-score threshold, and its SWAG-based epistemic
uncertainty remains below a seed-calibrated bound. This mechanism prevents
drift and false inclusions without relying on generative reconstruction or
replay buffers. Empirically, our system steadily refines the notion of
normality as unlabeled data arrive, producing substantial gains over baselines.
On COVID-CXR, ROC-AUC improves from 0.9489 to 0.9982 (F1: 0.8048 to 0.9746); on
Pneumonia CXR, ROC-AUC rises from 0.6834 to 0.8968; and on Brain MRI ND-5,
ROC-AUC increases from 0.6041 to 0.7269 and PR-AUC from 0.7539 to 0.8211. These
results highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework
for real-world, label-scarce medical imaging applications.

### [9] [Adaptive Temporal Refinement: Continuous Depth Allocation and Distance Regression for Efficient Action Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03943)
*Ibne Farabi Shihab,Sanjeda Akter,Anuj Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了边界距离回归(BDR)和自适应时序精化(ATR)两种互补方法，通过优化边界检测和自适应计算分配，显著提升了时序动作定位的精度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时序动作定位方法对所有边界采用统一计算，忽略了不同边界难度的显著差异，导致计算资源分配不合理。

Method: 1. BDR：通过有符号距离回归替代分类，提供信息论最优定位；2. ATR：通过连续深度选择τ∈[0,1]实现端到端可微分计算分配，无需强化学习。

Result: BDR使边界峰值锐化43%，在多种架构上带来1.8-3.1% mAP@0.7提升；ATR在THUMOS14上达到56.5% mAP@0.7（162G FLOPs），相比均匀处理的53.6%（198G FLOPs）提升2.9%同时减少18%计算量。

Conclusion: 该方法在四个基准测试中验证有效，通过知识蒸馏缓解训练成本，轻量级学生模型在基线成本下保持99%性能。

Abstract: Temporal action localization requires precise boundary detection; however,
current methods apply uniform computation despite significant variations in
difficulty across boundaries. We present two complementary contributions.
First, Boundary Distance Regression (BDR) provides information-theoretically
optimal localization through signed-distance regression rather than
classification, achieving 43\% sharper boundary peaks. BDR retrofits to
existing methods with approximately 50 lines of code, yielding consistent 1.8
to 3.1\% mAP@0.7 improvements across diverse architectures. Second, Adaptive
Temporal Refinement (ATR) allocates computation via continuous depth selection
$\tau \in [0,1]$, enabling end-to-end differentiable optimization without
reinforcement learning. On THUMOS14, ATR achieves 56.5\% mAP@0.7 at 162G FLOPs,
compared to 53.6\% at 198G for uniform processing, providing a 2.9\%
improvement with 18\% less compute. Gains scale with boundary heterogeneity,
showing 4.2\% improvement on short actions. Training cost is mitigated via
knowledge distillation, with lightweight students retaining 99\% performance at
baseline cost. Results are validated across four benchmarks with rigorous
statistical testing.

*Zhejia Cai,Puhua Jiang,Shiwei Mao,Hongkun Cao,Ruqi Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一优化几何和外观的框架，通过高斯引导的网格可微分渲染同时优化网格几何和顶点颜色，支持下游编辑任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常在几何精度和真实感渲染之间取舍，解耦几何和外观优化，这阻碍了下游编辑任务。

Method: 使用高斯引导的网格可微分渲染，同时优化网格几何（顶点位置和面）和顶点颜色，利用输入图像的光度一致性和法线、深度图的几何正则化。

Result: 获得了高质量的3D重建结果，可用于下游编辑任务如重光照和形状变形。

Conclusion: 该方法通过统一处理几何和外观优化，实现了无缝的高斯-网格联合优化，为3D编辑应用提供了更好的基础。

Abstract: Reconstructing real-world objects from multi-view images is essential for
applications in 3D editing, AR/VR, and digital content creation. Existing
methods typically prioritize either geometric accuracy (Multi-View Stereo) or
photorealistic rendering (Novel View Synthesis), often decoupling geometry and
appearance optimization, which hinders downstream editing tasks. This paper
advocates an unified treatment on geometry and appearance optimization for
seamless Gaussian-mesh joint optimization. More specifically, we propose a
novel framework that simultaneously optimizes mesh geometry (vertex positions
and faces) and vertex colors via Gaussian-guided mesh differentiable rendering,
leveraging photometric consistency from input images and geometric
regularization from normal and depth maps. The obtained high-quality 3D
reconstruction can be further exploit in down-stream editing tasks, such as
relighting and shape deformation. The code will be publicly available upon
acceptance.

*Zhong Chen,Changfeng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于线性分数变换参数的标定方法，用于解耦光场相机的主透镜和微透镜阵列，提高3D重建精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 光场相机内部参数的精确标定对于3D重建至关重要但具有挑战性，特别是主透镜和微透镜阵列的耦合问题。

Method: 引入线性分数变换参数α解耦主透镜和微透镜阵列，采用基于最小二乘的解析解和非线性优化，并提出了原始图像特征检测方法。

Result: 在物理和模拟数据上的实验验证了方法的性能，基于该模型的原始光场图像模拟速度更快，有利于数据驱动的深度学习方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了光场相机标定问题，提高了3D重建精度，并为深度学习应用提供了更快的模拟数据生成。

Abstract: Accurate calibration of internal parameters is a crucial yet challenging
prerequisite for 3D reconstruction using light field cameras. In this paper, we
propose a linear fractional transformation(LFT) parameter $\alpha$ to decoupled
the main lens and micro lens array (MLA). The proposed method includes an
analytical solution based on least squares, followed by nonlinear refinement.
The method for detecting features from the raw images is also introduced.
Experimental results on both physical and simulated data have verified the
performance of proposed method. Based on proposed model, the simulation of raw
light field images becomes faster, which is crucial for data-driven deep
learning methods. The corresponding code can be obtained from the author's
website.

### [12] [Room Envelopes: A Synthetic Dataset for Indoor Layout Reconstruction from Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03970)
*Sam Bahrami,Dylan Campbell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为Room Envelopes的合成数据集，用于训练单目几何估计器预测可见表面和结构布局表面，从而理解场景范围和物体形状位置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有场景重建方法只能恢复可见表面，无法重建被遮挡的结构元素（如墙壁、地板、天花板），而这些元素通常具有平面性、重复性和简单性，应该相对容易预测。

Method: 创建合成数据集，为每张RGB图像提供两个关联的点云图：一个捕获可见表面，另一个捕获移除家具和固定装置后的结构布局表面，用于直接监督前馈单目几何估计器。

Result: 该方法能够同时预测第一可见表面和第一布局表面，从而理解场景的完整范围以及其中物体的形状和位置。

Conclusion: 通过Room Envelopes数据集，可以训练模型理解场景的结构布局，填补现有方法在重建被遮挡表面方面的不足。

Abstract: Modern scene reconstruction methods are able to accurately recover 3D
surfaces that are visible in one or more images. However, this leads to
incomplete reconstructions, missing all occluded surfaces. While much progress
has been made on reconstructing entire objects given partial observations using
generative models, the structural elements of a scene, like the walls, floors
and ceilings, have received less attention. We argue that these scene elements
should be relatively easy to predict, since they are typically planar,
repetitive and simple, and so less costly approaches may be suitable. In this
work, we present a synthetic dataset -- Room Envelopes -- that facilitates
progress on this task by providing a set of RGB images and two associated
pointmaps for each image: one capturing the visible surface and one capturing
the first surface once fittings and fixtures are removed, that is, the
structural layout. As we show, this enables direct supervision for feed-forward
monocular geometry estimators that predict both the first visible surface and
the first layout surface. This confers an understanding of the scene's extent,
as well as the shape and location of its objects.

### [13] [Simple 3D Pose Features Support Human and Machine Social Scene Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03988)
*Wenshuo Qin,Leyla Isik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 人类通过3D姿态信息识别社交互动，而大多数AI视觉模型缺乏这种能力。研究发现3D关节位置比现有AI模型更能预测人类社交判断，且简单的3D社交姿态特征就能达到与完整关节集相同的预测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解人类如何从视觉输入中快速提取社交互动信息，以及为什么先进的AI视觉系统在这方面仍然面临挑战。

Method: 结合最先进的姿态和深度估计算法提取视频中人物的3D关节位置，并与当前AI视觉模型进行比较。还开发了一组紧凑的3D社交姿态特征来描述面部的位置和方向。

Result: 3D关节位置在预测人类社交判断方面优于大多数AI视觉模型。简化的3D社交姿态特征与完整关节集具有相同的预测能力，并能显著提升现成AI模型的性能。

Conclusion: 人类社交场景理解依赖于3D姿态的显式表征，可以通过简单的结构化视觉空间基元来支持。

Abstract: Humans can quickly and effortlessly extract a variety of information about
others' social interactions from visual input, ranging from visuospatial cues
like whether two people are facing each other to higher-level information. Yet,
the computations supporting these abilities remain poorly understood, and
social interaction recognition continues to challenge even the most advanced AI
vision systems. Here, we hypothesized that humans rely on 3D visuospatial pose
information to make social interaction judgments, which is absent in most AI
vision models. To test this, we combined state-of-the-art pose and depth
estimation algorithms to extract 3D joint positions of people in short video
clips depicting everyday human actions and compared their ability to predict
human social interaction judgments with current AI vision models. Strikingly,
3D joint positions outperformed most current AI vision models, revealing that
key social information is available in explicit body position but not in the
learned features of most vision models, including even the layer-wise
embeddings of the pose models used to extract joint positions. To uncover the
critical pose features humans use to make social judgments, we derived a
compact set of 3D social pose features describing only the 3D position and
direction of faces in the videos. We found that these minimal descriptors
matched the predictive strength of the full set of 3D joints and significantly
improved the performance of off-the-shelf AI vision models when combined with
their embeddings. Moreover, the degree to which 3D social pose features were
represented in each off-the-shelf AI vision model predicted the model's ability
to match human social judgments. Together, our findings provide strong evidence
that human social scene understanding relies on explicit representations of 3D

*Yuwen Tao,Kanglei Zhou,Xin Tan,Yuan Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CaRF是一个完全可微分的框架，通过引入高斯场相机编码和训练配对视图监督，直接在3D高斯空间中实现多视图一致的3D语义分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖2D渲染伪监督和视图特定特征学习，导致跨视图一致性不足，需要改进3D高斯场中的语言-几何对齐。

Method: 提出高斯场相机编码将相机几何融入高斯文本交互，建模视图依赖变化；引入训练配对视图监督对齐不同视图的高斯logits。

Result: 在三个基准测试上分别实现了16.8%、4.3%和2.0%的mIoU平均提升，优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: CaRF促进了更可靠和视图一致的3D场景理解，对具身AI、AR/VR交互和自主感知具有潜在益处。

Abstract: Referring 3D Gaussian Splatting Segmentation (R3DGS) aims to interpret
free-form language expressions and localize the corresponding 3D regions in
Gaussian fields. While recent advances have introduced cross-modal alignment
between language and 3D geometry, existing pipelines still struggle with
cross-view consistency due to their reliance on 2D rendered pseudo supervision
and view specific feature learning. In this work, we present Camera Aware
Referring Field (CaRF), a fully differentiable framework that operates directly
in the 3D Gaussian space and achieves multi view consistency. Specifically,
CaRF introduces Gaussian Field Camera Encoding (GFCE), which incorporates
camera geometry into Gaussian text interactions to explicitly model view
dependent variations and enhance geometric reasoning. Building on this, In
Training Paired View Supervision (ITPVS) is proposed to align per Gaussian
logits across calibrated views during training, effectively mitigating single
view overfitting and exposing inter view discrepancies for optimization.
Extensive experiments on three representative benchmarks demonstrate that CaRF
achieves average improvements of 16.8%, 4.3%, and 2.0% in mIoU over state of
the art methods on the Ref LERF, LERF OVS, and 3D OVS datasets, respectively.
Moreover, this work promotes more reliable and view consistent 3D scene
understanding, with potential benefits for embodied AI, AR/VR interaction, and
autonomous perception.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了PhysCorr框架，通过PhysicsRM奖励模型和PhyDPO优化方法，提升视频生成的物理一致性，解决现有模型在物体动态、交互和运动模式上的不真实问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到视频生成模型在感知质量上取得了显著进展，但生成的视频内容经常违反物理合理性原则，表现为不合理的物体动态、不连贯的交互和不真实的运动模式，这阻碍了在具身AI、机器人和仿真密集型领域的应用。

Method: 提出了PhysCorr统一框架，包括：1）PhysicsRM - 首个双维度奖励模型，量化物体内部稳定性和物体间交互；2）PhyDPO - 基于对比反馈和物理感知重加权的新型直接偏好优化流程。该框架与模型无关，可扩展到各种视频扩散和基于transformer的骨干网络。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，PhysCorr在保持视觉保真度和语义对齐的同时，显著提高了物理真实感。

Conclusion: 这项工作向物理基础和可信的视频生成迈出了关键一步，为在要求物理一致性的应用场景中部署视频生成模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation have achieved impressive
perceptual quality, yet generated content often violates fundamental principles
of physical plausibility - manifesting as implausible object dynamics,
incoherent interactions, and unrealistic motion patterns. Such failures hinder
the deployment of video generation models in embodied AI, robotics, and
simulation-intensive domains. To bridge this gap, we propose PhysCorr, a
unified framework for modeling, evaluating, and optimizing physical consistency
in video generation. Specifically, we introduce PhysicsRM, the first
dual-dimensional reward model that quantifies both intra-object stability and
inter-object interactions. On this foundation, we develop PhyDPO, a novel
direct preference optimization pipeline that leverages contrastive feedback and
physics-aware reweighting to guide generation toward physically coherent
outputs. Our approach is model-agnostic and scalable, enabling seamless
integration into a wide range of video diffusion and transformer-based
backbones. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
PhysCorr achieves significant improvements in physical realism while preserving
visual fidelity and semantic alignment. This work takes a critical step toward
physically grounded and trustworthy video generation.

Motivation: 领域泛化需要视觉Transformer在未见领域上的鲁棒性能，但标准微调成本高且可能损害泛化能力，需要参数高效的解决方案

Method: 提出GNN-MoE框架，使用图神经网络（GCN、GAT、SAGE）作为路由器，在补丁间图上动态分配补丁到专家，利用补丁间关系进行上下文感知路由

Result: 在领域泛化基准测试中达到最先进或具有竞争力的性能，同时保持高参数效率

Conclusion: 基于图的上下文路由对于实现鲁棒、轻量级的领域泛化具有重要价值

Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) seeks robust Vision Transformer (ViT) performance
on unseen domains. Efficiently adapting pretrained ViTs for DG is challenging;
standard fine-tuning is costly and can impair generalization. We propose
GNN-MoE, enhancing Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for DG with a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework using efficient Kronecker adapters. Instead
of token-based routing, a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) router (GCN, GAT,
SAGE) operates on inter-patch graphs to dynamically assign patches to
specialized experts. This context-aware GNN routing leverages inter-patch
relationships for better adaptation to domain shifts. GNN-MoE achieves
state-of-the-art or competitive DG benchmark performance with high parameter
efficiency, highlighting the utility of graph-based contextual routing for
robust, lightweight DG.

TL;DR: 提出MedDChest，一个专为胸部影像优化的基础视觉Transformer模型，通过在120万张多模态医学图像上从头预训练，结合新颖的内容感知数据增强策略，显著超越ImageNet预训练模型在胸部诊断任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学影像中视觉模型性能受限于在自然图像上预训练的基础模型所导致的基本领域差距问题。

Method: 从10个公开源收集120万张多模态胸部图像（X光和CT），从头预训练ViT模型，并提出引导随机调整裁剪（Guided Random Resized Crops）的内容感知数据增强策略，偏向于解剖相关区域采样。

Result: 在多个下游诊断任务上的综合实验表明，MedDChest显著优于公开可用的ImageNet预训练模型。

Conclusion: 通过大规模领域内预训练结合领域特定数据增强，MedDChest为广泛的胸部诊断任务提供了更强大的特征提取器起点，模型权重将公开以促进未来研究。

Abstract: The performance of vision models in medical imaging is often hindered by the
prevailing paradigm of fine-tuning backbones pre-trained on out-of-domain
natural images. To address this fundamental domain gap, we propose MedDChest, a
new foundational Vision Transformer (ViT) model optimized specifically for
thoracic imaging. We pre-trained MedDChest from scratch on a massive, curated,
multimodal dataset of over 1.2 million images, encompassing different
modalities including Chest X-ray and Computed Tomography (CT) compiled from 10
public sources. A core technical contribution of our work is Guided Random
Resized Crops, a novel content-aware data augmentation strategy that biases
sampling towards anatomically relevant regions, overcoming the inefficiency of
standard cropping techniques on medical scans. We validate our model's
effectiveness by fine-tuning it on a diverse set of downstream diagnostic
tasks. Comprehensive experiments empirically demonstrate that MedDChest
significantly outperforms strong, publicly available ImageNet-pretrained
models. By establishing the superiority of large-scale, in-domain pre-training
combined with domain-specific data augmentation, MedDChest provides a powerful
and robust feature extractor that serves as a significantly better starting
point for a wide array of thoracic diagnostic tasks. The model weights will be
made publicly available to foster future research and applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于低帧率指尖视频PPG信号的轻量级生物认证框架，使用混合深度学习模型CVT-ConvMixer-LSTM，在46个受试者上达到98%的认证准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PPG信号因其无创采集、活体检测能力和低成本可穿戴设备适用性而受到关注，但信号质量受运动伪影、光照变化和个体生理差异影响，需要鲁棒的特征提取和分类方法。

Method: 使用CFIHSR数据集（46个受试者，14Hz采样率），预处理包括基线漂移去除、PCA运动伪影抑制、带通滤波、傅里叶重采样和幅度归一化。通过CWT将一维PPG信号转换为时频标度图，开发CVT-ConvMixer-LSTM混合模型结合空间和时间特征。

Conclusion: 该系统因其高效性、可扩展性和固有的活体检测能力，非常适合现实世界的移动和嵌入式生物安全应用。

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, which measure changes in blood volume in
the skin using light, have recently gained attention in biometric
authentication because of their non-invasive acquisition, inherent liveness
detection, and suitability for low-cost wearable devices. However, PPG signal
quality is challenged by motion artifacts, illumination changes, and
inter-subject physiological variability, making robust feature extraction and
classification crucial. This study proposes a lightweight and cost-effective
biometric authentication framework based on PPG signals extracted from
low-frame-rate fingertip videos. The CFIHSR dataset, comprising PPG recordings
from 46 subjects at a sampling rate of 14 Hz, is employed for evaluation. The
raw PPG signals undergo a standard preprocessing pipeline involving baseline
drift removal, motion artifact suppression using Principal Component Analysis
(PCA), bandpass filtering, Fourier-based resampling, and amplitude
normalization. To generate robust representations, each one-dimensional PPG
segment is converted into a two-dimensional time-frequency scalogram via the
Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), effectively capturing transient
cardiovascular dynamics. We developed a hybrid deep learning model, termed
CVT-ConvMixer-LSTM, by combining spatial features from the Convolutional Vision
Transformer (CVT) and ConvMixer branches with temporal features from a Long
Short-Term Memory network (LSTM). The experimental results on 46 subjects
demonstrate an authentication accuracy of 98%, validating the robustness of the
model to noise and variability between subjects. Due to its efficiency,
scalability, and inherent liveness detection capability, the proposed system is
well-suited for real-world mobile and embedded biometric security applications.

TL;DR: Bratrix是一个多模态语言锚定的视觉-大脑对齐框架，通过将视觉刺激分解为层次化视觉和语言语义组件，在共享潜在空间中实现视觉-语言和大脑-语言嵌入的对齐，显著提升了神经信号解码性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法直接将神经活动与视觉嵌入对齐，但纯视觉表示往往无法捕捉潜在语义维度，限制了可解释性和深度鲁棒性。需要解决主题变异性和视觉特征纠缠问题。

Method: 提出Bratrix框架：1）将视觉刺激分解为层次化视觉和语言语义组件；2）在共享潜在空间中对齐视觉和大脑表示；3）引入不确定性感知模块处理噪声神经信号；4）使用可学习的语言锚定语义矩阵增强跨模态相关性；5）采用单模态预训练+多模态微调的两阶段训练策略。

Result: 在EEG、MEG和fMRI基准测试中，Bratrix在检索、重建和字幕生成任务上优于现有方法，特别是在200-way EEG检索任务中提升了14.3%。

Conclusion: Bratrix通过多模态语言锚定方法有效解决了神经信号解码中的语义理解挑战，为视觉语义从神经信号中的提取提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Unveiling visual semantics from neural signals such as EEG, MEG, and fMRI
remains a fundamental challenge due to subject variability and the entangled
nature of visual features. Existing approaches primarily align neural activity
directly with visual embeddings, but visual-only representations often fail to
capture latent semantic dimensions, limiting interpretability and deep
robustness. To address these limitations, we propose Bratrix, the first
end-to-end framework to achieve multimodal Language-Anchored Vision-Brain
alignment. Bratrix decouples visual stimuli into hierarchical visual and
linguistic semantic components, and projects both visual and brain
representations into a shared latent space, enabling the formation of aligned
visual-language and brain-language embeddings. To emulate human-like perceptual
reliability and handle noisy neural signals, Bratrix incorporates a novel
uncertainty perception module that applies uncertainty-aware weighting during
alignment. By leveraging learnable language-anchored semantic matrices to
enhance cross-modal correlations and employing a two-stage training strategy of
single-modality pretraining followed by multimodal fine-tuning, Bratrix-M
improves alignment precision. Extensive experiments on EEG, MEG, and fMRI
benchmarks demonstrate that Bratrix improves retrieval, reconstruction, and
captioning performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, specifically
surpassing 14.3% in 200-way EEG retrieval task. Code and model are available.

TL;DR: 该论文比较了两种无配对自监督CT图像去噪方法：基于CycleGAN的残差翻译器和Noise2Score分数匹配去噪器，发现CycleGAN在最终图像质量上表现最佳，而Noise2Score在无配对情况下提供稳健的替代方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在无配对和自监督条件下进行CT图像去噪，评估两种训练数据效率高的方法，以解决缺乏干净配对数据时的去噪问题。

Method: 使用CycleGAN残差翻译器和Noise2Score分数匹配去噪器，通过配置扫描确定最佳参数设置，包括lambda_cycle=30、lambda_iden=2、ngf=ndf=64的标准U-Net架构，并进行长时间训练。

Result: 选定的CycleGAN将噪声输入从34.66 dB/0.9234 SSIM提升到38.913 dB/0.971 SSIM，估计得分为1.9441，未见数据集得分为1.9343。Noise2Score在绝对PSNR/SSIM上稍逊，但对高噪声输入有显著改善。

Conclusion: CycleGAN提供最强的最终图像质量，而Noise2Score在无配对情况下提供稳健的替代方案，两者在CT图像去噪中各有优势。

Abstract: We study CT image denoising in the unpaired and self-supervised regimes by
evaluating two strong, training-data-efficient paradigms: a CycleGAN-based
residual translator and a Noise2Score (N2S) score-matching denoiser. Under a
common evaluation protocol, a configuration sweep identifies a simple standard
U-Net backbone within CycleGAN (lambda_cycle = 30, lambda_iden = 2, ngf = ndf =
64) as the most reliable setting; we then train it to convergence with a longer
schedule. The selected CycleGAN improves the noisy input from 34.66 dB / 0.9234
SSIM to 38.913 dB / 0.971 SSIM and attains an estimated score of 1.9441 and an
unseen-set (Kaggle leaderboard) score of 1.9343. Noise2Score, while slightly
behind in absolute PSNR / SSIM, achieves large gains over very noisy inputs,
highlighting its utility when clean pairs are unavailable. Overall, CycleGAN
offers the strongest final image quality, whereas Noise2Score provides a robust
pair-free alternative with competitive performance. Source code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UKAST是一种U-Net架构，将基于有理函数的Kolmogorov-Arnold网络集成到Swin Transformer编码器中，在多个医学图像分割基准上实现了最先进的性能，特别在数据稀缺场景下表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割面临复杂解剖结构和有限标注数据的挑战。CNN擅长局部特征提取但难以建模长距离依赖，Transformer能有效捕获全局上下文但数据需求大且计算昂贵。

Method: 将有理函数基础的KANs集成到Swin Transformer编码器中，使用Group Rational KANs (GR-KANs)来提升表达能力和数据效率，同时减少FLOPs。

Result: 在四个不同的2D和3D医学图像分割基准上实现了最先进的性能，超越了CNN和Transformer基线，在数据稀缺设置下获得更高的准确率。

Conclusion: KAN增强的Transformer有潜力推进数据高效的医学图像分割，缓解了标准Vision Transformer的数据饥饿限制。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is critical for accurate diagnostics and treatment
planning, but remains challenging due to complex anatomical structures and
limited annotated training data. CNN-based segmentation methods excel at local
feature extraction, but struggle with modeling long-range dependencies.
Transformers, on the other hand, capture global context more effectively, but
are inherently data-hungry and computationally expensive. In this work, we
introduce UKAST, a U-Net like architecture that integrates rational-function
based Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) into Swin Transformer encoders. By
leveraging rational base functions and Group Rational KANs (GR-KANs) from the
Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (KAT), our architecture addresses the
inefficiencies of vanilla spline-based KANs, yielding a more expressive and
data-efficient framework with reduced FLOPs and only a very small increase in
parameter count compared to SwinUNETR. UKAST achieves state-of-the-art
performance on four diverse 2D and 3D medical image segmentation benchmarks,
consistently surpassing both CNN- and Transformer-based baselines. Notably, it
attains superior accuracy in data-scarce settings, alleviating the data-hungry
limitations of standard Vision Transformers. These results show the potential
of KAN-enhanced Transformers to advance data-efficient medical image
segmentation. Code is available at: https://github.com/nsapkota417/UKAST

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成方法未能充分利用位置信息，导致对对象空间布局理解不足，无法精确控制生成图像中对象的位置。

Method: 提出SpatialLock框架，包含两个组件：位置参与注入(PoI)通过注意力层直接整合空间信息；位置引导学习(PoG)使用基于感知的监督进一步细化对象定位。

Result: 实验表明SpatialLock在精确对象定位方面达到了新的最先进水平，在多个数据集上实现了超过0.9的IOU分数。

Conclusion: SpatialLock能够生成具有精确空间排列的对象，并提高生成图像的视觉质量，为文本到图像生成中的精确对象定位提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) synthesis has made significant advancements in recent
years, driving applications such as generating datasets automatically. However,
precise control over object localization in generated images remains a
challenge. Existing methods fail to fully utilize positional information,
leading to an inadequate understanding of object spatial layouts. To address
this issue, we propose SpatialLock, a novel framework that leverages perception
signals and grounding information to jointly control the generation of spatial
locations. SpatialLock incorporates two components: Position-Engaged Injection
(PoI) and Position-Guided Learning (PoG). PoI directly integrates spatial
information through an attention layer, encouraging the model to learn the
grounding information effectively. PoG employs perception-based supervision to
further refine object localization. Together, these components enable the model
to generate objects with precise spatial arrangements and improve the visual
quality of the generated images. Experiments show that SpatialLock sets a new
state-of-the-art for precise object positioning, achieving IOU scores above 0.9
across multiple datasets.

Motivation: 传统扩散求解器未能充分利用附加引导项对数值误差的鲁棒性，存在计算冗余。研究发现噪声估计和附加引导项对数值误差的敏感性存在显著差异。

Method: 将CFG ODE重新表述为多速率ODE系统：噪声估计在精细时间步网格上积分（乌龟方程），附加引导项在粗网格上积分（兔子方程）。引入误差边界感知时间步采样器和引导尺度调度器。

Result: 在几乎不损失生成保真度（ΔImageReward ≤ 0.032）的情况下，将函数评估次数减少高达30%，在相同计算预算下优于最先进的基于CFG的无训练加速器。

Conclusion: 多速率公式在扩散求解器中具有巨大潜力，为无需模型重新训练即可实现实时高质量图像合成开辟了新途径。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Tortoise and Hare Guidance (THG), a training-free
strategy that accelerates diffusion sampling while maintaining high-fidelity
generation. We demonstrate that the noise estimate and the additional guidance
term exhibit markedly different sensitivity to numerical error by reformulating
the classifier-free guidance (CFG) ODE as a multirate system of ODEs. Our
error-bound analysis shows that the additional guidance branch is more robust
to approximation, revealing substantial redundancy that conventional solvers
fail to exploit. Building on this insight, THG significantly reduces the
computation of the additional guidance: the noise estimate is integrated with
the tortoise equation on the original, fine-grained timestep grid, while the
additional guidance is integrated with the hare equation only on a coarse grid.
We also introduce (i) an error-bound-aware timestep sampler that adaptively
selects step sizes and (ii) a guidance-scale scheduler that stabilizes large
extrapolation spans. THG reduces the number of function evaluations (NFE) by up
to 30% with virtually no loss in generation fidelity ($\Delta$ImageReward
$\leq$ 0.032) and outperforms state-of-the-art CFG-based training-free
accelerators under identical computation budgets. Our findings highlight the
potential of multirate formulations for diffusion solvers, paving the way for
real-time high-quality image synthesis without any model retraining. The source

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models have facilitated progress in sketch
generation. However, existing specialized methods primarily focus on generic
synthesis and lack mechanisms for precise control over sketch styles. In this
work, we propose a training-free framework based on diffusion models that
enables explicit style guidance via textual prompts and referenced style
sketches. Unlike previous style transfer methods that overwrite key and value
matrices in self-attention, we incorporate the reference features as auxiliary
information with linear smoothing and leverage a style-content guidance
mechanism. This design effectively reduces content leakage from reference
sketches and enhances synthesis quality, especially in cases with low
structural similarity between reference and target sketches. Furthermore, we
extend our framework to support controllable multi-style generation by
integrating features from multiple reference sketches, coordinated via a joint
AdaIN module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
high-quality sketch generation with accurate style alignment and improved
flexibility in style control. The official implementation of M3S is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂海洋环境导致相机运动和视觉退化，给多目标跟踪带来挑战，需要解决平台运动和真实目标运动的解耦问题。

Method: 采用双分支并行架构：检测和重识别分支包含可逆柱状检测网络和轻量Transformer外观提取器；相机运动估计分支通过投影变换解耦平台和目标运动，在卡尔曼滤波中补偿平台运动。

Result: 在新加坡海事数据集上达到最先进性能，在基于ReID的MOT框架中运行速度最快，同时保持高身份一致性和对抖动、遮挡的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DMSORT通过有效的运动补偿和特征融合，在复杂海洋环境中实现了高效准确的多目标跟踪。

Abstract: Accurate perception of the marine environment through robust multi-object
tracking (MOT) is essential for ensuring safe vessel navigation and effective
maritime surveillance. However, the complicated maritime environment often
causes camera motion and subsequent visual degradation, posing significant
challenges to MOT. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient
Dual-branch Maritime SORT (DMSORT) method for maritime MOT. The core of the
framework is a parallel tracker with affine compensation, which incorporates an
object detection and re-identification (ReID) branch, along with a dedicated
branch for dynamic camera motion estimation. Specifically, a Reversible
Columnar Detection Network (RCDN) is integrated into the detection module to
leverage multi-level visual features for robust object detection. Furthermore,
a lightweight Transformer-based appearance extractor (Li-TAE) is designed to
capture global contextual information and generate robust appearance features.
Another branch decouples platform-induced and target-intrinsic motion by
constructing a projective transformation, applying platform-motion compensation
within the Kalman filter, and thereby stabilizing true object trajectories.
Finally, a clustering-optimized feature fusion module effectively combines
motion and appearance cues to ensure identity consistency under noise,
occlusion, and drift. Extensive evaluations on the Singapore Maritime Dataset
demonstrate that DMSORT achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, DMSORT
attains the fastest runtime among existing ReID-based MOT frameworks while
maintaining high identity consistency and robustness to jitter and occlusion.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个让计算机使用代理从在线视频中学习的框架，通过检索教程视频、转换为结构化演示轨迹，并在执行时动态选择轨迹作为上下文指导，从而提升代理在需要领域特定知识的任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机使用代理在执行需要特定应用程序、平台和多步骤工作流程的领域知识任务时，仍然落后于人类用户。人类可以通过观看视频教程来弥补这一差距，而现有代理缺乏这种能力。

Method: 提出一个框架：检索和过滤教程视频，使用视觉语言模型（VLM）推断UI动作，将视频分割为短动作子序列并为每个子序列分配文本目标。在执行时采用两阶段选择机制动态选择最相关的轨迹作为上下文指导。

Result: 在两个广泛使用的基准测试上，该框架始终优于强基线代理和仅使用文本教程或转录的变体。分析强调了轨迹分割和选择、动作过滤以及视觉信息的重要性。

Conclusion: 丰富的在线视频可以系统地提炼为可操作的指导，在推理时改进计算机使用代理。该方法为代理从视频中学习提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Computer-use agents can operate computers and automate laborious tasks, but
despite recent rapid progress, they still lag behind human users, especially
when tasks require domain-specific procedural knowledge about particular
applications, platforms, and multi-step workflows. Humans can bridge this gap
by watching video tutorials: we search, skim, and selectively imitate short
segments that match our current subgoal. In this paper, we study how to enable
computer-use agents to learn from online videos at inference time effectively.
We propose a framework that retrieves and filters tutorial videos, converts
them into structured demonstration trajectories, and dynamically selects
trajectories as in-context guidance during execution. Particularly, using a
VLM, we infer UI actions, segment videos into short subsequences of actions,
and assign each subsequence a textual objective. At inference time, a two-stage
selection mechanism dynamically chooses a single trajectory to add in context
at each step, focusing the agent on the most helpful local guidance for its
next decision. Experiments on two widely used benchmarks show that our
framework consistently outperforms strong base agents and variants that use
only textual tutorials or transcripts. Analyses highlight the importance of
trajectory segmentation and selection, action filtering, and visual
information, suggesting that abundant online videos can be systematically
distilled into actionable guidance that improves computer-use agents at
inference time. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了OCR-Rotation-Bench（ORB）基准测试，用于评估OCR对图像旋转的鲁棒性，并开发了一个基于Phi-3.5-Vision的轻量级旋转分类管道，在旋转校正任务中达到96%和92%的准确率，显著提升OCR性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在文档理解中，扫描或拍摄文档的正确方向确定是关键的预处理步骤，因为相机拍摄时的方向错误会导致OCR性能下降。

Method: 构建了ORB基准测试（包括英文和11种印度语言数据集），并开发了基于Phi-3.5-Vision视觉编码器的轻量级旋转分类管道，采用动态图像裁剪技术，专门针对4类旋转任务进行微调。

Result: 旋转分类在ORB数据集上分别达到96%和92%的准确率；在模拟真实世界设置中，显著提升了闭源OCR模型（最高14%）和开源OCR模型（最高4倍）的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了旋转校正模块在提升OCR性能中的关键作用，特别是在处理用户拍摄错误导致的文档方向问题时。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in document understanding, determining the
correct orientation of scanned or photographed documents remains a critical
pre-processing step in the real world settings. Accurate rotation correction is
essential for enhancing the performance of downstream tasks such as Optical
Character Recognition (OCR) where misalignment commonly arises due to user
errors, particularly incorrect base orientations of the camera during capture.
In this study, we first introduce OCR-Rotation-Bench (ORB), a new benchmark for
evaluating OCR robustness to image rotations, comprising (i) ORB-En, built from
rotation-transformed structured and free-form English OCR datasets, and (ii)
ORB-Indic, a novel multilingual set spanning 11 Indic mid to low-resource
languages. We also present a fast, robust and lightweight rotation
classification pipeline built on the vision encoder of Phi-3.5-Vision model
with dynamic image cropping, fine-tuned specifically for 4-class rotation task
in a standalone fashion. Our method achieves near-perfect 96% and 92% accuracy
on identifying the rotations respectively on both the datasets. Beyond
classification, we demonstrate the critical role of our module in boosting OCR
performance: closed-source (up to 14%) and open-weights models (up to 4x) in
the simulated real-world setting.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了不同颜色转换技术对H&E染色图像与非线性多模态图像配准的影响，发现CycleGAN颜色转换在两种场景下均获得最低配准误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数字病理学中，准确配准不同模态的图像对于生物标志物分析和组织重建等应用至关重要，但不同染色或成像模式之间的配准具有挑战性。

Method: 使用20个组织样本对，应用多种预处理步骤（CycleGAN、Macenko、Reinhard、Vahadane颜色转换、反转、对比度调整、强度归一化和去噪），采用VALIS配准方法进行刚性和非刚性配准，评估相对目标配准误差。

Result: 在两种场景（原始或反转多模态图像）中，CycleGAN颜色转换均实现了最低的配准误差，而其他方法显示出更高的误差。

Conclusion: 配准前应用颜色转换可改善不同模态图像之间的对齐，支持数字病理学中更可靠的分析。

Abstract: Image registration refers to the process of spatially aligning two or more
images by mapping them into a common coordinate system, so that corresponding
anatomical or tissue structures are matched across images. In digital
pathology, registration enables direct comparison and integration of
information from different stains or imaging modalities, sup-porting
applications such as biomarker analysis and tissue reconstruction. Accurate
registration of images from different modalities is an essential step in
digital pathology. In this study, we investigated how various color
transformation techniques affect image registration between hematoxylin and
eosin (H&E) stained images and non-linear multimodal images. We used a dataset
of 20 tissue sample pairs, with each pair undergoing several preprocessing
steps, including different color transformation (CycleGAN, Macenko, Reinhard,
Vahadane), inversion, contrast adjustment, intensity normalization, and
denoising. All images were registered using the VALIS registration method,
which first applies rigid registration and then performs non-rigid registration
in two steps on both low and high-resolution images. Registration performance
was evaluated using the relative Target Registration Error (rTRE). We reported
the median of median rTRE values (MMrTRE) and the average of median rTRE values
(AMrTRE) for each method. In addition, we performed a custom point-based
evaluation using ten manually selected key points. Registration was done
separately for two scenarios, using either the original or inverted multimodal
images. In both scenarios, CycleGAN color transformation achieved the lowest
registration errors, while the other methods showed higher errors. These
findings show that applying color transformation before registration improves
alignment between images from different modalities and supports more reliable
analysis in digital pathology.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了协方差描述符在医学图像分类中的应用，特别是结合预训练通用视觉编码器（DINOv2和MedSAM）和SPDNet网络，在MedMNIST基准测试中取得了优于手工特征和现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 协方差描述符在通用计算机视觉任务中表现出色，但在医学影像领域尚未充分探索。研究者希望验证其在医学图像分类中的有效性，特别是结合预训练视觉编码器。

Method: 使用预训练通用视觉编码器（DINOv2和MedSAM）提取特征构建协方差描述符，并与手工特征进行比较。采用专门为对称正定矩阵设计的SPDNet分类网络，在MedMNIST基准的11个二分类和多分类数据集上进行评估。

Conclusion: 协方差描述符与强大的预训练视觉编码器结合在医学图像分析中具有巨大潜力，为医学图像分类提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Covariance descriptors capture second-order statistics of image features.
They have shown strong performance in general computer vision tasks, but remain
underexplored in medical imaging. We investigate their effectiveness for both
conventional and learning-based medical image classification, with a particular
focus on SPDNet, a classification network specifically designed for symmetric
positive definite (SPD) matrices. We propose constructing covariance
descriptors from features extracted by pre-trained general vision encoders
(GVEs) and comparing them with handcrafted descriptors. Two GVEs - DINOv2 and
MedSAM - are evaluated across eleven binary and multi-class datasets from the
MedMNSIT benchmark. Our results show that covariance descriptors derived from
GVE features consistently outperform those derived from handcrafted features.
Moreover, SPDNet yields superior performance to state-of-the-art methods when
combined with DINOv2 features. Our findings highlight the potential of
combining covariance descriptors with powerful pretrained vision encoders for
medical image analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于均值和方差的图像风格迁移方法在运动数据上效果有限，因为运动数据具有复杂的动态模式和时空一致性特征，需要更全面的统计建模。

Method: 提出自适应统计融合器(AStF)，包含风格解耦模块(SDM)和高阶多统计注意力机制(HOS-Attn)，并结合运动一致性正则化(MCR)判别器进行训练。

Result: 实验结果表明，通过更全面地建模动态风格中的时空统计模式，AStF在运动风格迁移任务中表现出优于现有方法的性能。

Conclusion: 引入偏度和峰度等更高阶统计量能够更有效地捕捉运动数据的复杂动态特征，显著提升运动风格迁移的质量。

Abstract: Human motion style transfer allows characters to appear less rigidity and
more realism with specific style. Traditional arbitrary image style transfer
typically process mean and variance which is proved effective. Meanwhile,
similar methods have been adapted for motion style transfer. However, due to
the fundamental differences between images and motion, relying on mean and
variance is insufficient to fully capture the complex dynamic patterns and
spatiotemporal coherence properties of motion data. Building upon this, our key
insight is to bring two more coefficient, skewness and kurtosis, into the
analysis of motion style. Specifically, we propose a novel Adaptive Statistics
Fusor (AStF) which consists of Style Disentanglement Module (SDM) and
High-Order Multi-Statistics Attention (HOS-Attn). We trained our AStF in
conjunction with a Motion Consistency Regularization (MCR) discriminator.
Experimental results show that, by providing a more comprehensive model of the
spatiotemporal statistical patterns inherent in dynamic styles, our proposed
AStF shows proficiency superiority in motion style transfers over
state-of-the-arts. Our code and model are available at

Conclusion: 人类中心的基础模型为解剖标志点检测提供了强大的先验知识，这一潜力此前未被充分挖掘，MedSapiens证明了这种适应策略的有效性。

Abstract: This paper does not introduce a novel architecture; instead, it revisits a
fundamental yet overlooked baseline: adapting human-centric foundation models
for anatomical landmark detection in medical imaging. While landmark detection
has traditionally relied on domain-specific models, the emergence of
large-scale pre-trained vision models presents new opportunities. In this
study, we investigate the adaptation of Sapiens, a human-centric foundation
model designed for pose estimation, to medical imaging through multi-dataset
pretraining, establishing a new state of the art across multiple datasets. Our
proposed model, MedSapiens, demonstrates that human-centric foundation models,
inherently optimized for spatial pose localization, provide strong priors for
anatomical landmark detection, yet this potential has remained largely
untapped. We benchmark MedSapiens against existing state-of-the-art models,
achieving up to 5.26% improvement over generalist models and up to 21.81%
improvement over specialist models in the average success detection rate (SDR).
To further assess MedSapiens adaptability to novel downstream tasks with few
annotations, we evaluate its performance in limited-data settings, achieving
2.69% improvement over the few-shot state of the art in SDR. Code and model
weights are available at https://github.com/xmed-lab/MedSapiens .

Result: 仅使用闭集数据训练，在Macro AUC上达到98.13%；学习的潜在几何结构在后处理下保持鲁棒性；在已知和未知生成器之间实现强可分性；超越现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 在潜在空间中建模信号泄漏偏差能够实现可靠且可解释的AI图像和深度伪造取证，为扩散模型生成的图像溯源提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The growing sophistication of synthetic image and deepfake generation models
has turned source attribution and authenticity verification into a critical
challenge for modern computer vision systems. Recent studies suggest that
diffusion pipelines unintentionally imprint persistent statistical traces,
known as signal leaks, within their outputs, particularly in latent
representations. Building on this observation, we propose Proto-LeakNet, a
signal-leak-aware and interpretable attribution framework that integrates
closed-set classification with a density-based open-set evaluation on the
learned embeddings, enabling analysis of unseen generators without retraining.
Operating in the latent domain of diffusion models, our method re-simulates
partial forward diffusion to expose residual generator-specific cues. A
temporal attention encoder aggregates multi-step latent features, while a
feature-weighted prototype head structures the embedding space and enables
transparent attribution. Trained solely on closed data and achieving a Macro
AUC of 98.13%, Proto-LeakNet learns a latent geometry that remains robust under
post-processing, surpassing state-of-the-art methods, and achieves strong
separability between known and unseen generators. These results demonstrate
that modeling signal-leak bias in latent space enables reliable and
interpretable AI-image and deepfake forensics. The code for the whole work will
be available upon submission.

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注模态不变的外观特征，但忽视了步态特征在跨模态识别中的优势。步态特征不仅模态不变，还包含丰富的时序动态信息，对视频级跨模态匹配至关重要。

Method: 1. 语义感知轮廓与步态学习模型：利用DINOv2生成语义增强的轮廓表示；2. 渐进式双向多粒度增强模块：在步态和外观流之间进行多粒度双向交互，融合全局和局部特征。

Conclusion: 提出的DinoGRL框架通过结合步态特征和外观线索，有效提升了跨模态视频行人重识别的性能，证明了步态特征在跨模态识别中的重要价值。

Abstract: Video-based Visible-Infrared person re-identification (VVI-ReID) aims to
retrieve the same pedestrian across visible and infrared modalities from video
sequences. Existing methods tend to exploit modality-invariant visual features
but largely overlook gait features, which are not only modality-invariant but
also rich in temporal dynamics, thus limiting their ability to model the
spatiotemporal consistency essential for cross-modal video matching. To address
these challenges, we propose a DINOv2-Driven Gait Representation Learning
(DinoGRL) framework that leverages the rich visual priors of DINOv2 to learn
gait features complementary to appearance cues, facilitating robust
sequence-level representations for cross-modal retrieval. Specifically, we
introduce a Semantic-Aware Silhouette and Gait Learning (SASGL) model, which
generates and enhances silhouette representations with general-purpose semantic
priors from DINOv2 and jointly optimizes them with the ReID objective to
achieve semantically enriched and task-adaptive gait feature learning.
Furthermore, we develop a Progressive Bidirectional Multi-Granularity
Enhancement (PBMGE) module, which progressively refines feature representations
by enabling bidirectional interactions between gait and appearance streams
across multiple spatial granularities, fully leveraging their complementarity
to enhance global representations with rich local details and produce highly
discriminative features. Extensive experiments on HITSZ-VCM and BUPT datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our approach, significantly outperforming
existing state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有的3D高斯溅射加速方法在训练过程中无法有效控制高斯数量，导致冗余计算时间开销。

Method: 提出基于多视图一致性的致密化和剪枝策略，摒弃预算机制，充分考虑每个高斯基元的重要性。

Result: 在Mip-NeRF 360数据集上比DashGaussian快3.32倍，在Deep Blending数据集上比原始3DGS快15.45倍，渲染质量相当。在动态场景重建、表面重建等任务中实现2-7倍加速。

Conclusion: FastGS具有强通用性，在多种任务中都能显著加速训练，同时保持可比的渲染质量。

Abstract: The dominant 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) acceleration methods fail to
properly regulate the number of Gaussians during training, causing redundant
computational time overhead. In this paper, we propose FastGS, a novel, simple,
and general acceleration framework that fully considers the importance of each
Gaussian based on multi-view consistency, efficiently solving the trade-off
between training time and rendering quality. We innovatively design a
densification and pruning strategy based on multi-view consistency, dispensing
with the budgeting mechanism. Extensive experiments on Mip-NeRF 360, Tanks &
Temples, and Deep Blending datasets demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in training speed, achieving a
3.32$\times$ training acceleration and comparable rendering quality compared
with DashGaussian on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset and a 15.45$\times$ acceleration
compared with vanilla 3DGS on the Deep Blending dataset. We demonstrate that
FastGS exhibits strong generality, delivering 2-7$\times$ training acceleration
across various tasks, including dynamic scene reconstruction, surface

simultaneous localization and mapping. The project page is available at

Conclusion: 领域专用基础模型具有强大的泛化能力，能显著减少人工标注工作量，为除草剂试验分析提供可扩展的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Herbicide field trials require accurate identification of plant species and
assessment of herbicide-induced damage across diverse environments. While
general-purpose vision foundation models have shown promising results in
complex visual domains, their performance can be limited in agriculture, where
fine-grained distinctions between species and damage types are critical.
  In this work, we adapt a general-purpose vision foundation model to herbicide
trial characterization. Trained using a self-supervised learning approach on a
large, curated agricultural dataset, the model learns rich and transferable
representations optimized for herbicide trials images.
  Our domain-specific model significantly outperforms the best general-purpose
foundation model in both species identification (F1 score improvement from 0.91
to 0.94) and damage classification (from 0.26 to 0.33). Under unseen conditions
(new locations and other time), it achieves even greater gains (species
identification from 0.56 to 0.66; damage classification from 0.17 to 0.27). In
domain-shift scenarios, such as drone imagery, it maintains strong performance
(species classification from 0.49 to 0.60).
  Additionally, we show that domain-specific pretraining enhances segmentation
accuracy, particularly in low-annotation regimes. An annotation-efficiency
analysis reveals that, under unseen conditions, the domain-specific model
achieves 5.4% higher F1 score than the general-purpose model, while using 80%
fewer labeled samples.
  These results demonstrate the generalization capabilities of domain-specific
foundation models and their potential to significantly reduce manual annotation
efforts, offering a scalable and automated solution for herbicide trial
analysis.

Abstract: The recent and ongoing expansion of marine infrastructure, including offshore
wind farms, oil and gas platforms, artificial islands, and aquaculture
facilities, highlights the need for effective monitoring systems. The
development of robust models for offshore infrastructure detection relies on
comprehensive, balanced datasets, but falls short when samples are scarce,
particularly for underrepresented object classes, shapes, and sizes. By
training deep learning-based YOLOv10 object detection models with a combination
of synthetic and real Sentinel-1 satellite imagery acquired in the fourth
quarter of 2023 from four regions (Caspian Sea, South China Sea, Gulf of
Guinea, and Coast of Brazil), this study investigates the use of synthetic
training data to enhance model performance. We evaluated this approach by
applying the model to detect offshore platforms in three unseen regions (Gulf
of Mexico, North Sea, Persian Gulf) and thereby assess geographic
transferability. This region-holdout evaluation demonstrated that the model
generalises beyond the training areas. In total, 3,529 offshore platforms were
detected, including 411 in the North Sea, 1,519 in the Gulf of Mexico, and
1,593 in the Persian Gulf. The model achieved an F1 score of 0.85, which
improved to 0.90 upon incorporating synthetic data. We analysed how synthetic
data enhances the representation of unbalanced classes and overall model
performance, taking a first step toward globally transferable detection of
offshore infrastructure. This study underscores the importance of balanced
datasets and highlights synthetic data generation as an effective strategy to
address common challenges in remote sensing, demonstrating the potential of
deep learning for scalable, global offshore infrastructure monitoring.

Motivation: 现有文本到视频扩散模型依赖预训练文本编码器，但对简洁提示的语义理解有限，且无法在线重述提示以更好地匹配用户意图，限制了模型的扩展性和可用性。

Method: 提出重述适配器模块，使扩散模型能够在LLM进行下一个词预测时使用文本隐藏状态作为视频生成条件，从而隐式地将基础提示重述为更全面的表示。

Conclusion: RISE-T2V通过集成提示重述和语义特征提取，有效解决了文本到视频模型对简洁提示理解不足的问题，提升了模型的语义对齐能力和生成质量。

Abstract: Most text-to-video(T2V) diffusion models depend on pre-trained text encoders
for semantic alignment, yet they often fail to maintain video quality when
provided with concise prompts rather than well-designed ones. The primary issue
lies in their limited textual semantics understanding. Moreover, these text
encoders cannot rephrase prompts online to better align with user intentions,
which limits both the scalability and usability of the models, To address these
challenges, we introduce RISE-T2V, which uniquely integrates the processes of
prompt rephrasing and semantic feature extraction into a single and seamless
step instead of two separate steps. RISE-T2V is universal and can be applied to
various pre-trained LLMs and video diffusion models(VDMs), significantly
enhancing their capabilities for T2V tasks. We propose an innovative module
called the Rephrasing Adapter, enabling diffusion models to utilize text hidden
states during the next token prediction of the LLM as a condition for video
generation. By employing a Rephrasing Adapter, the video generation model can
implicitly rephrase basic prompts into more comprehensive representations that
better match the user's intent. Furthermore, we leverage the powerful
capabilities of LLMs to enable video generation models to accomplish a broader
range of T2V tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RISE-T2V is a
versatile framework applicable to different video diffusion model
architectures, significantly enhancing the ability of T2V models to generate
high-quality videos that align with user intent. Visual results are available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射学图像中肿瘤的精确分割是专业且耗时的任务，目前是临床环境中定量分析的瓶颈。传统方法因3D扫描数据量大，通常需要降采样或使用图像块，限制了分割精度

Method: 两阶段方法：第一阶段进行体素稀疏化处理，第二阶段使用子流形稀疏卷积网络。该方法允许使用高分辨率输入和原生3D模型架构

Result: 在KiTS23挑战赛的肾癌CT图像上，取得了与挑战赛优胜者相当的结果：肾脏+肿块Dice系数95.8%，肿瘤+囊肿85.7%，单独肿瘤80.3%。计算效率显著提升，推理时间减少60%，VRAM使用减少75%

Conclusion: 该方法在保持最先进分割精度的同时，显著降低了计算资源需求，为临床环境中常规进行定量分析提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: The accurate delineation of tumours in radiological images like Computed
Tomography is a very specialised and time-consuming task, and currently a
bottleneck preventing quantitative analyses to be performed routinely in the
clinical setting. For this reason, developing methods for the automated
segmentation of tumours in medical imaging is of the utmost importance and has
driven significant efforts in recent years. However, challenges regarding the
impracticality of 3D scans, given the large amount of voxels to be analysed,
usually requires the downsampling of such images or using patches thereof when
applying traditional convolutional neural networks. To overcome this problem,
in this paper we propose a new methodology that uses, divided into two stages,
voxel sparsification and submanifold sparse convolutional networks. This method
allows segmentations to be performed with high-resolution inputs and a native
3D model architecture, obtaining state-of-the-art accuracies while
significantly reducing the computational resources needed in terms of GPU
memory and time. We studied the deployment of this methodology in the context
of Computed Tomography images of renal cancer patients from the KiTS23
challenge, and our method achieved results competitive with the challenge
winners, with Dice similarity coefficients of 95.8% for kidneys + masses, 85.7%
for tumours + cysts, and 80.3% for tumours alone. Crucially, our method also
offers significant computational improvements, achieving up to a 60% reduction
in inference time and up to a 75\% reduction in VRAM usage compared to an
equivalent dense architecture, across both CPU and various GPU cards tested.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of nine convolutional neural
network architectures for binary classification of horses and motorcycles in
the VOC 2008 dataset. We address the significant class imbalance problem by
implementing minority-class augmentation techniques. Our experiments compare
modern architectures including ResNet-50, ConvNeXt-Tiny, DenseNet-121, and

classification tasks and quantifies the impact of data augmentation strategies
in mitigating class imbalance issues in object detection.

*Sanjay Kumar,Tim Brophy,Eoin Martino Grua,Ganesh Sistu,Valentina Donzella,Ciaran Eising*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究分析了传感器遮挡对BEVFusion架构3D目标检测性能的影响，发现相机遮挡导致41.3%的mAP下降，LiDAR在重度遮挡下下降47.3%，融合设置中LiDAR遮挡影响更大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BEV表示在多传感器融合中表现出色，但环境遮挡对3D检测精度的影响尚未充分探索，需要研究传感器遮挡对检测性能的影响。

Method: 使用BEVFusion架构在nuScenes数据集上评估相机和LiDAR遮挡对3D检测的影响，采用mAP和NDS作为性能指标。

Result: 相机遮挡导致mAP下降41.3%，LiDAR在重度遮挡下下降47.3%，融合设置中相机遮挡影响较小（4.1%下降），LiDAR遮挡影响较大（26.8%下降）。

Conclusion: 模型对LiDAR依赖更强，需要开发遮挡感知评估方法和改进的传感器融合技术以应对部分传感器失效或环境退化。

Abstract: Accurate 3D object detection is essential for automated vehicles to navigate
safely in complex real-world environments. Bird's Eye View (BEV)
representations, which project multi-sensor data into a top-down spatial
format, have emerged as a powerful approach for robust perception. Although
BEV-based fusion architectures have demonstrated strong performance through
multimodal integration, the effects of sensor occlusions, caused by
environmental conditions such as fog, haze, or physical obstructions, on 3D
detection accuracy remain underexplored. In this work, we investigate the
impact of occlusions on both camera and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)
outputs using the BEVFusion architecture, evaluated on the nuScenes dataset.
Detection performance is measured using mean Average Precision (mAP) and the
nuScenes Detection Score (NDS). Our results show that moderate camera
occlusions lead to a 41.3% drop in mAP (from 35.6% to 20.9%) when detection is
based only on the camera. On the other hand, LiDAR sharply drops in performance
only under heavy occlusion, with mAP falling by 47.3% (from 64.7% to 34.1%),
with a severe impact on long-range detection. In fused settings, the effect
depends on which sensor is occluded: occluding the camera leads to a minor 4.1%
drop (from 68.5% to 65.7%), while occluding LiDAR results in a larger 26.8%
drop (to 50.1%), revealing the model's stronger reliance on LiDAR for the task
of 3D object detection. Our results highlight the need for future research into
occlusion-aware evaluation methods and improved sensor fusion techniques that
can maintain detection accuracy in the presence of partial sensor failure or
degradation due to adverse environmental conditions.

Abstract: Background In analytical chemistry, spatial information about materials is
commonly captured through imaging techniques, such as traditional color cameras
or with advanced hyperspectral cameras and microscopes. However, efficiently
extracting and analyzing this spatial information for exploratory and
predictive purposes remains a challenge, especially when using traditional
chemometric methods. Recent advances in deep learning and artificial
intelligence have significantly enhanced image processing capabilities,
enabling the extraction of multiscale deep features that are otherwise
challenging to capture with conventional image processing techniques. Despite
the wide availability of open-source deep learning models, adoption in
analytical chemistry remains limited because of the absence of structured,
step-by-step guidance for implementing these models.
  Results This tutorial aims to bridge this gap by providing a step-by-step
guide for applying deep learning approaches to extract spatial information from
imaging data and integrating it with other data sources, such as spectral
information. Importantly, the focus of this work is not on training deep
learning models for image processing but on using existing open source models
to extract deep features from imaging data.
  Significance The tutorial provides MATLAB code tutorial demonstrations,
showcasing the processing of imaging data from various imaging modalities
commonly encountered in analytical chemistry. Readers must run the tutorial
steps on their own datasets using the codes presented in this tutorial.

visual grounding, reasoning, and interpretation, producing responses that are
both accurate and interpretable. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that our
approach substantially improves over single-task baselines in both answer
accuracy and visual localization, highlighting the effectiveness of grounded
multi-task learning for medical VQA applications.

Abstract: Depth estimation is one of the key technologies for realizing 3D perception
in unmanned systems. Monocular depth estimation has been widely researched
because of its low-cost advantage, but the existing methods face the challenges
of poor depth estimation performance and blurred object boundaries on embedded
systems. In this paper, we propose a novel monocular depth estimation model,
BoRe-Depth, which contains only 8.7M parameters. It can accurately estimate
depth maps on embedded systems and significantly improves boundary quality.
Firstly, we design an Enhanced Feature Adaptive Fusion Module (EFAF) which
adaptively fuses depth features to enhance boundary detail representation.
Secondly, we integrate semantic knowledge into the encoder to improve the
object recognition and boundary perception capabilities. Finally, BoRe-Depth is
deployed on NVIDIA Jetson Orin, and runs efficiently at 50.7 FPS. We
demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms previous
lightweight models on multiple challenging datasets, and we provide detailed
ablation studies for the proposed methods. The code is available at

TL;DR: HideAndSeg是一个用于分割章鱼视频的AI工具，结合SAM2和YOLOv11，通过最小监督实现自动化分割，并引入无监督指标评估分割质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于章鱼的伪装能力、皮肤纹理颜色快速变化、非刚性身体变形和频繁遮挡，加上水下光照和浑浊度变化，在自然栖息地分析章鱼具有挑战性。现有缺乏大规模标注数据集。

Method: 集成SAM2与定制训练的YOLOv11对象检测器。用户提供点坐标生成初始分割掩码，然后训练YOLO模型，最后通过边界框提示实现全自动管道。引入时间一致性DICE_t和新组件计数NC_t两个无监督指标。

Result: HideAndSeg取得满意性能，相比手动提示方法减少分割噪声。在完全遮挡后仍能重新识别和分割章鱼，而手动提示模型在此场景下失败。

Conclusion: 通过减少真实场景中手动分析需求，该工具为野生头足类动物行为研究提供了更高效的方法。

Abstract: Analyzing octopuses in their natural habitats is challenging due to their
camouflage capability, rapid changes in skin texture and color, non-rigid body
deformations, and frequent occlusions, all of which are compounded by variable
underwater lighting and turbidity. Addressing the lack of large-scale annotated
datasets, this paper introduces HideAndSeg, a novel, minimally supervised
AI-based tool for segmenting videos of octopuses. It establishes a quantitative
baseline for this task. HideAndSeg integrates SAM2 with a custom-trained
YOLOv11 object detector. First, the user provides point coordinates to generate
the initial segmentation masks with SAM2. These masks serve as training data
for the YOLO model. After that, our approach fully automates the pipeline by
providing a bounding box prompt to SAM2, eliminating the need for further
manual intervention. We introduce two unsupervised metrics - temporal
consistency $DICE_t$ and new component count $NC_t$ - to quantitatively
evaluate segmentation quality and guide mask refinement in the absence of
ground-truth data, i.e., real-world information that serves to train, validate,
and test AI models. Results show that HideAndSeg achieves satisfactory
performance, reducing segmentation noise compared to the manually prompted
approach. Our method can re-identify and segment the octopus even after periods
of complete occlusion in natural environments, a scenario in which the manually
prompted model fails. By reducing the need for manual analysis in real-world
scenarios, this work provides a practical tool that paves the way for more
efficient behavioral studies of wild cephalopods.

Conclusion: 成功扩展了自动拼图求解器的应用范围，为凸多边形拼图提供了首个计算解决方案和基准数据集。

Abstract: Jigsaw puzzle solving requires the rearrangement of unordered pieces into
their original pose in order to reconstruct a coherent whole, often an image,
and is known to be an intractable problem. While the possible impact of
automatic puzzle solvers can be disruptive in various application domains, most
of the literature has focused on developing solvers for square jigsaw puzzles,
severely limiting their practical use. In this work, we significantly expand
the types of puzzles handled computationally, focusing on what is known as
Convex Partitions, a major subset of polygonal puzzles whose pieces are convex.
We utilize both geometrical and pictorial compatibilities, introduce a greedy
solver, and report several performance measures next to the first benchmark
dataset of such puzzles.

Abstract: Empowering Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to deeply integrate image
interaction with long-horizon reasoning capabilities remains a long-standing
challenge in this field. Recent advances in vision-centric reasoning explore a
promising "Thinking with Images" paradigm for LMMs, marking a shift from
image-assisted reasoning to image-interactive thinking. While this milestone
enables models to focus on fine-grained image regions, progress remains
constrained by limited visual tool spaces and task-specific workflow designs.
To bridge this gap, we present V-Thinker, a general-purpose multimodal
reasoning assistant that enables interactive, vision-centric thinking through
end-to-end reinforcement learning. V-Thinker comprises two key components: (1)
a Data Evolution Flywheel that automatically synthesizes, evolves, and verifies
interactive reasoning datasets across three dimensions-diversity, quality, and
difficulty; and (2) a Visual Progressive Training Curriculum that first aligns
perception via point-level supervision, then integrates interactive reasoning
through a two-stage reinforcement learning framework. Furthermore, we introduce
VTBench, an expert-verified benchmark targeting vision-centric interactive
reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that V-Thinker consistently
outperforms strong LMM-based baselines in both general and interactive
reasoning scenarios, providing valuable insights for advancing
image-interactive reasoning applications.

Result: 该模型在滑坡测绘任务中持续优于任务特定的CNN（U-Net、U-Net++）、视觉变换器（Segformer、SwinV2-B）和其他GeoFMs（TerraMind、SatMAE），对光谱变化具有韧性，在标签稀缺情况下保持准确性，并在不同数据集和地理环境中具有更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: GeoFMs为滑坡风险降低和环境监测提供了更稳健和可扩展的方法，但仍面临计算成本高和可重用AI就绪训练数据有限等挑战。

Abstract: Landslides cause severe damage to lives, infrastructure, and the environment,
making accurate and timely mapping essential for disaster preparedness and
response. However, conventional deep learning models often struggle when
applied across different sensors, regions, or under conditions of limited
training data. To address these challenges, we present a three-axis analytical
framework of sensor, label, and domain for adapting geospatial foundation
models (GeoFMs), focusing on Prithvi-EO-2.0 for landslide mapping. Through a
series of experiments, we show that it consistently outperforms task-specific
CNNs (U-Net, U-Net++), vision transformers (Segformer, SwinV2-B), and other
GeoFMs (TerraMind, SatMAE). The model, built on global pretraining,
self-supervision, and adaptable fine-tuning, proved resilient to spectral
variation, maintained accuracy under label scarcity, and generalized more
reliably across diverse datasets and geographic settings. Alongside these
strengths, we also highlight remaining challenges such as computational cost
and the limited availability of reusable AI-ready training data for landslide
research. Overall, our study positions GeoFMs as a step toward more robust and
scalable approaches for landslide risk reduction and environmental monitoring.

Abstract: Video generation has achieved remarkable progress, with generated videos
increasingly resembling real ones. However, the rapid advance in generation has
outpaced the development of adequate evaluation metrics. Currently, the
assessment of talking head generation primarily relies on limited metrics,
evaluating general video quality, lip synchronization, and on conducting user
studies. Motivated by this, we propose a new evaluation framework comprising 8
metrics related to three dimensions (i) quality, (ii) naturalness, and (iii)
synchronization. In selecting the metrics, we place emphasis on efficiency, as
well as alignment with human preferences. Based on this considerations, we
streamline to analyze fine-grained dynamics of head, mouth, and eyebrows, as
well as face quality. Our extensive experiments on 85,000 videos generated by
17 state-of-the-art models suggest that while many algorithms excel in lip
synchronization, they face challenges with generating expressiveness and
artifact-free details. These videos were generated based on a novel real
dataset, that we have curated, in order to mitigate bias of training data. Our
proposed benchmark framework is aimed at evaluating the improvement of
generative methods. Original code, dataset and leaderboards will be publicly
released and regularly updated with new methods, in order to reflect progress
in the field.

TL;DR: STC-Net是一个基于单时间戳的腹腔镜胆囊切除术复杂性评估框架，能够在弱时间监督下直接分析完整手术视频，实现炎症严重程度的自动分级。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确评估腹腔镜胆囊切除术的手术复杂性至关重要，严重炎症与更长手术时间和更高并发症风险相关。Parkland分级量表提供了临床验证的炎症严重程度分层框架，但其在手术视频中的自动化应用仍未被充分探索。

Method: 提出STC-Net框架，通过定位、窗口提议和分级模块联合执行时间定位和分级。引入结合硬软定位目标和背景感知分级监督的新损失函数，能够在弱时间监督下直接处理完整视频。

Result: 在1,859个腹腔镜胆囊切除术视频的私有数据集上，STC-Net达到62.11%的准确率和61.42%的F1分数，比非定位基线方法在两个指标上均提升超过10%。

Conclusion: STC-Net展示了从完整腹腔镜胆囊切除术视频进行自动化PGS手术复杂性评估的可扩展有效方法，有望用于术后分析和手术培训。

Abstract: Purpose: Accurate assessment of surgical complexity is essential in
Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy (LC), where severe inflammation is associated with
longer operative times and increased risk of postoperative complications. The
Parkland Grading Scale (PGS) provides a clinically validated framework for
stratifying inflammation severity; however, its automation in surgical videos
remains largely unexplored, particularly in realistic scenarios where complete
videos must be analyzed without prior manual curation. Methods: In this work,
we introduce STC-Net, a novel framework for SingleTimestamp-based Complexity
estimation in LC via the PGS, designed to operate under weak temporal
supervision. Unlike prior methods limited to static images or manually trimmed
clips, STC-Net operates directly on full videos. It jointly performs temporal
localization and grading through a localization, window proposal, and grading
module. We introduce a novel loss formulation combining hard and soft
localization objectives and background-aware grading supervision. Results:
Evaluated on a private dataset of 1,859 LC videos, STC-Net achieves an accuracy
of 62.11% and an F1-score of 61.42%, outperforming non-localized baselines by
over 10% in both metrics and highlighting the effectiveness of weak supervision
for surgical complexity assessment. Conclusion: STC-Net demonstrates a scalable
and effective approach for automated PGS-based surgical complexity estimation
from full LC videos, making it promising for post-operative analysis and
surgical training.

Motivation: 传统文本和图像思维范式存在局限性：图像只能捕捉单一时刻，无法表示动态过程；文本和视觉作为分离模态阻碍了统一的多模态理解与生成。

Method: 引入"Thinking with Video"范式，利用Sora-2等视频生成模型，并开发VideoThinkBench基准测试，包含视觉中心任务和文本中心任务两类。

Result: Sora-2在视觉中心任务上与最先进VLM相当，在某些任务如Eyeballing Games上甚至超越VLM；在文本中心任务上，MATH准确率达92%，MMMU达75.53%。自一致性和上下文学习能进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: 视频生成模型有潜力成为统一的多模态理解和生成模型，"Thinking with Video"可作为统一的多模态推理范式。

Abstract: "Thinking with Text" and "Thinking with Images" paradigm significantly
improve the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) and Vision
Language Models (VLMs). However, these paradigms have inherent limitations. (1)
Images capture only single moments and fail to represent dynamic processes or
continuous changes, and (2) The separation of text and vision as distinct
modalities, hindering unified multimodal understanding and generation. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce "Thinking with Video", a new paradigm
that leverages video generation models, such as Sora-2, to bridge visual and
textual reasoning in a unified temporal framework. To support this exploration,
we developed the Video Thinking Benchmark (VideoThinkBench). VideoThinkBench
encompasses two task categories: (1) vision-centric tasks (e.g., Eyeballing
Puzzles), and (2) text-centric tasks (e.g., subsets of GSM8K, MMMU). Our
evaluation establishes Sora-2 as a capable reasoner. On vision-centric tasks,
Sora-2 is generally comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) VLMs, and even
surpasses VLMs on several tasks, such as Eyeballing Games. On text-centric
tasks, Sora-2 achieves 92% accuracy on MATH, and 75.53% accuracy on MMMU.
Furthermore, we systematically analyse the source of these abilities. We also
find that self-consistency and in-context learning can improve Sora-2's
performance. In summary, our findings demonstrate that the video generation
model is the potential unified multimodal understanding and generation model,
positions "thinking with video" as a unified multimodal reasoning paradigm.

TL;DR: UniSplat是一个用于自动驾驶的前馈3D重建框架，通过统一的潜在时空融合解决稀疏、非重叠相机视图和复杂场景动态的联合挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理稀疏、非重叠相机视图和复杂场景动态时存在困难，需要一种能够统一处理时空信息并实现鲁棒动态场景重建的框架。

Method: 构建3D潜在支架捕获几何和语义场景上下文，引入高效融合机制在3D支架内直接操作实现时空对齐，设计双分支解码器结合点锚定细化和基于体素的生成来产生动态感知高斯，并维护静态高斯的持久内存以实现流式场景补全。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，UniSplat在新视角合成方面达到最先进性能，即使在原始相机覆盖范围之外的视点也能提供鲁棒和高质量的渲染。

Conclusion: UniSplat通过统一的潜在时空融合框架，成功解决了自动驾驶中复杂动态场景的3D重建挑战，实现了超越现有方法的重建质量和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D reconstruction for autonomous driving has advanced rapidly,
yet existing methods struggle with the joint challenges of sparse,
non-overlapping camera views and complex scene dynamics. We present UniSplat, a
general feed-forward framework that learns robust dynamic scene reconstruction
through unified latent spatio-temporal fusion. UniSplat constructs a 3D latent
scaffold, a structured representation that captures geometric and semantic
scene context by leveraging pretrained foundation models. To effectively
integrate information across spatial views and temporal frames, we introduce an
efficient fusion mechanism that operates directly within the 3D scaffold,
enabling consistent spatio-temporal alignment. To ensure complete and detailed
reconstructions, we design a dual-branch decoder that generates dynamic-aware
Gaussians from the fused scaffold by combining point-anchored refinement with
voxel-based generation, and maintain a persistent memory of static Gaussians to
enable streaming scene completion beyond current camera coverage. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that UniSplat achieves
state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis, while providing robust
and high-quality renderings even for viewpoints outside the original camera
coverage.

TL;DR: PixCLIP是一个新颖的框架，通过同时处理视觉提示输入和长文本描述，解决了CLIP模型在细粒度图像-文本对齐方面的局限性，实现了像素级交互和长文本处理能力的突破。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP模型在细粒度图像-文本对齐方面存在局限性，特别是其文本编码器的token长度限制阻碍了处理更细粒度文本信息的能力。现有方法主要关注提升视觉信息处理的粒度，但缺乏对文本内容处理粒度的协同增强。

Method: 1) 建立自动标注流水线生成像素级定位的长文本描述，构建LongGRIT数据集(近150万样本)；2) 用LLM替换CLIP的原始文本编码器；3) 提出三分支像素-文本对齐学习框架，实现任意粒度的图像区域与对应文本描述的细粒度对齐。

Result: PixCLIP在像素级交互和长文本处理方面取得突破，实现了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: PixCLIP通过协同增强视觉和文本内容处理的粒度，有效解决了CLIP模型在细粒度图像-文本对齐方面的限制，为像素级视觉语言理解任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: While the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining(CLIP) model has achieved
remarkable success in a variety of downstream vison language understanding
tasks, enhancing its capability for fine-grained image-text alignment remains
an active research focus. To this end, most existing works adopt the strategy
of explicitly increasing the granularity of visual information processing,
e.g., incorporating visual prompts to guide the model focus on specific local
regions within the image. Meanwhile, researches on Multimodal Large Language
Models(MLLMs) have demonstrated that training with long and detailed textual
descriptions can effectively improve the model's fine-grained vision-language
alignment. However, the inherent token length limitation of CLIP's text encoder
fundamentally limits CLIP to process more granular textual information embedded
in long text sequences. To synergistically leverage the advantages of enhancing
both visual and textual content processing granularity, we propose PixCLIP, a
novel framework designed to concurrently accommodate visual prompt inputs and
process lengthy textual descriptions. Specifically, we first establish an
automated annotation pipeline capable of generating pixel-level localized,
long-form textual descriptions for images. Utilizing this pipeline, we
construct LongGRIT, a high-quality dataset comprising nearly 1.5 million
samples. Secondly, we replace CLIP's original text encoder with the LLM and
propose a three-branch pixel-text alignment learning framework, facilitating
fine-grained alignment between image regions and corresponding textual
descriptions at arbitrary granularity. Experiments demonstrate that PixCLIP
showcases breakthroughs in pixel-level interaction and handling long-form
texts, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于染色精度的虚拟IHC图像质量评估框架，通过颜色反卷积生成IHC阳性像素掩码，计算Dice、IoU等指标来量化染色准确性，发现传统图像保真度指标与病理学家评估相关性差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型可以从H&E图像生成虚拟IHC染色，但现有基于纹理和分布的图像质量评估方法只能量化图像保真度，无法评估IHC染色的准确性。

Method: 使用颜色反卷积生成真实和虚拟IHC的IHC阳性像素掩码，计算Dice、IoU、Hausdorff距离等染色精度指标，无需专家手动标注。

Result: 传统图像保真度指标（FID、PSNR、SSIM）与染色精度和病理学家评估相关性差；配对的PyramidPix2Pix和AdaptiveNCE模型染色精度最高；非配对的扩散和GAN模型可靠性较低；全玻片图像评估显示基于patch评估无法发现的性能下降。

Conclusion: 该框架为评估虚拟IHC模型质量提供了可重复的方法，是加速病理学家常规使用的关键步骤。

Abstract: Deep learning models can generate virtual immunohistochemistry (IHC) stains
from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) images, offering a scalable and low-cost
alternative to laboratory IHC. However, reliable evaluation of image quality
remains a challenge as current texture- and distribution-based metrics quantify
image fidelity rather than the accuracy of IHC staining. Here, we introduce an
automated and accuracy grounded framework to determine image quality across
sixteen paired or unpaired image translation models. Using color deconvolution,
we generate masks of pixels stained brown (i.e., IHC-positive) as predicted by
each virtual IHC model. We use the segmented masks of real and virtual IHC to
compute stain accuracy metrics (Dice, IoU, Hausdorff distance) that directly
quantify correct pixel - level labeling without needing expert manual
annotations. Our results demonstrate that conventional image fidelity metrics,
including Frechet Inception Distance (FID), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR),
and structural similarity (SSIM), correlate poorly with stain accuracy and
pathologist assessment. Paired models such as PyramidPix2Pix and AdaptiveNCE
achieve the highest stain accuracy, whereas unpaired diffusion- and GAN-based
models are less reliable in providing accurate IHC positive pixel labels.
Moreover, whole-slide images (WSI) reveal performance declines that are
invisible in patch-based evaluations, emphasizing the need for WSI-level
benchmarks. Together, this framework defines a reproducible approach for
assessing the quality of virtual IHC models, a critical step to accelerate
translation towards routine use by pathologists.

TL;DR: 提出了一种可扩展的流式视频质量评估模型，该模型无需参考视频和人工标注，通过利用DAVIS数据集的合成退化来训练时间感知卷积架构，直接预测FR指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频质量评估方法存在局限性：全参考方法需要干净参考视频，大多数无参考模型依赖昂贵的人工标注训练，而大多数无意见感知的无参考方法是基于图像的，忽略了视频对象检测的关键时间上下文。

Method: 使用DAVIS数据集的合成退化，训练时间感知卷积架构直接从退化视频预测FR指标（LPIPS、PSNR、SSIM），在推理时无需参考视频。

Result: 流式方法在多样化退化上表现优于图像基线，与全参考指标的相关性高于广泛使用的BRISQUE基线，验证了时间建模和无意见感知方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 时间建模对于现实世界视觉系统中可扩展的视频质量评估具有重要价值，提出的方法在无需参考和人工标注的情况下实现了有效的视频质量评估。

Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) is vital for computer vision tasks, but
existing approaches face major limitations: full-reference (FR) metrics require
clean reference videos, and most no-reference (NR) models depend on training on
costly human opinion labels. Moreover, most opinion-unaware NR methods are
image-based, ignoring temporal context critical for video object detection. In
this work, we present a scalable, streaming-based VQA model that is both
no-reference and opinion-unaware. Our model leverages synthetic degradations of
the DAVIS dataset, training a temporal-aware convolutional architecture to
predict FR metrics (LPIPS , PSNR, SSIM) directly from degraded video, without
references at inference. We show that our streaming approach outperforms our
own image-based baseline by generalizing across diverse degradations,
underscoring the value of temporal modeling for scalable VQA in real-world
vision systems. Additionally, we demonstrate that our model achieves higher
correlation with full-reference metrics compared to BRISQUE, a widely-used
opinion-aware image quality assessment baseline, validating the effectiveness
of our temporal, opinion-unaware approach.

TL;DR: 偏振分辨近红外成像通过测量眼组织反射光的偏振状态，为眼动追踪提供了额外的光学对比机制，相比仅使用强度图像的方法，能显著降低注视误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统眼动追踪仅依赖光强信息，而偏振成像能揭示巩膜上的可追踪特征和角膜上的注视信息模式，这些在纯强度图像中基本不存在。

Method: 使用偏振滤光片阵列相机配合线性偏振近红外照明器构建偏振眼动追踪系统，通过卷积神经网络对346名参与者的数据进行训练。

Result: 在正常条件以及眼睑遮挡、眼距变化和瞳孔大小变化等情况下，PET系统相比容量匹配的强度基线将中位数95百分位绝对注视误差降低了10-16%。

Conclusion: 光-组织偏振效应能为人机交互带来实际增益，PET作为一种简单、鲁棒的传感模式，有望应用于未来的可穿戴设备。

Abstract: Polarization-resolved near-infrared imaging adds a useful optical contrast
mechanism to eye tracking by measuring the polarization state of light
reflected by ocular tissues in addition to its intensity. In this paper we
demonstrate how this contrast can be used to enable eye tracking. Specifically,
we demonstrate that a polarization-enabled eye tracking (PET) system composed
of a polarization--filter--array camera paired with a linearly polarized
near-infrared illuminator can reveal trackable features across the sclera and
gaze-informative patterns on the cornea, largely absent in intensity-only
images. Across a cohort of 346 participants, convolutional neural network based
machine learning models trained on data from PET reduced the median
95th-percentile absolute gaze error by 10--16\% relative to capacity-matched
intensity baselines under nominal conditions and in the presence of eyelid
occlusions, eye-relief changes, and pupil-size variation. These results link
light--tissue polarization effects to practical gains in human--computer
interaction and position PET as a simple, robust sensing modality for future
wearable devices.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种诊断和去偏多模态基准测试的方法，通过测试集压力测试和迭代偏置剪枝来识别和消除非视觉偏见，确保基准测试真正评估模型的视觉理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型基准测试存在严重问题，模型可以通过利用偏见、语言先验和表面模式来取得高分，而不需要真正的视觉理解能力，这削弱了基准测试的有效性。

Method: 提出测试集压力测试方法，使用k折交叉验证在纯文本测试集上微调大语言模型来揭示捷径性能，并配合基于随机森林的轻量级诊断；采用迭代偏置剪枝程序过滤高偏见样本。

Result: 在四个基准测试上的应用揭示了普遍存在的非视觉偏见；通过完整框架创建的VSI-Bench-Debiased显示出显著降低的非视觉可解性和更大的视觉盲性能差距。

Conclusion: 基准测试设计应采用诊断原则，主动识别和消除非视觉偏见，以确保真正评估模型的视觉理解能力，而不是表面模式匹配。

Abstract: Robust benchmarks are crucial for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs). Yet we find that models can ace many multimodal benchmarks without
strong visual understanding, instead exploiting biases, linguistic priors, and
superficial patterns. This is especially problematic for vision-centric
benchmarks that are meant to require visual inputs. We adopt a diagnostic
principle for benchmark design: if a benchmark can be gamed, it will be.
Designers should therefore try to ``game'' their own benchmarks first, using
diagnostic and debiasing procedures to systematically identify and mitigate
non-visual biases. Effective diagnosis requires directly ``training on the test
set'' -- probing the released test set for its intrinsic, exploitable patterns.
  We operationalize this standard with two components. First, we diagnose
benchmark susceptibility using a ``Test-set Stress-Test'' (TsT) methodology.
Our primary diagnostic tool involves fine-tuning a powerful Large Language
Model via $k$-fold cross-validation on exclusively the non-visual, textual
inputs of the test set to reveal shortcut performance and assign each sample a
bias score $s(x)$. We complement this with a lightweight Random Forest-based
diagnostic operating on hand-crafted features for fast, interpretable auditing.
Second, we debias benchmarks by filtering high-bias samples using an
``Iterative Bias Pruning'' (IBP) procedure. Applying this framework to four
benchmarks -- VSI-Bench, CV-Bench, MMMU, and VideoMME -- we uncover pervasive
non-visual biases. As a case study, we apply our full framework to create
VSI-Bench-Debiased, demonstrating reduced non-visual solvability and a wider
vision-blind performance gap than the original.

Motivation: 多模态语言模型在时空空间推理方面存在困难，而获取具有精确空间标注的多样化真实视频数据存在瓶颈。

Method: 利用3D模拟器的特权信息创建空间丰富的视频训练数据，通过系统消融研究问题类型、混合和规模的影响。

Result: 识别出三种最有效的问题类别（度量测量、视角依赖推理和时间跟踪），使用25K模拟示例训练的7B模型超越了72B基线，在真实世界空间推理基准上达到竞争性表现。

Conclusion: 模拟数据可以高效地发展可迁移的空间智能，在保持通用视频理解能力的同时，在具身和真实世界空间任务上实现显著改进。

Abstract: Despite impressive high-level video comprehension, multimodal language models
struggle with spatial reasoning across time and space. While current spatial
training approaches rely on real-world video data, obtaining diverse footage
with precise spatial annotations remains a bottleneck. To alleviate this
bottleneck, we present SIMS-V -- a systematic data-generation framework that
leverages the privileged information of 3D simulators to create spatially-rich
video training data for multimodal language models. Using this framework, we
investigate which properties of simulated data drive effective real-world
transfer through systematic ablations of question types, mixes, and scales. We
identify a minimal set of three question categories (metric measurement,
perspective-dependent reasoning, and temporal tracking) that prove most
effective for developing transferable spatial intelligence, outperforming
comprehensive coverage despite using fewer question types. These insights
enable highly efficient training: our 7B-parameter video LLM fine-tuned on just
25K simulated examples outperforms the larger 72B baseline and achieves
competitive performance with proprietary models on rigorous real-world spatial
reasoning benchmarks. Our approach demonstrates robust generalization,
maintaining performance on general video understanding while showing
substantial improvements on embodied and real-world spatial tasks.

Motivation: 当前多模态智能系统主要关注反应式任务驱动方法，缺乏真正的空间认知和世界建模能力，需要转向更全面的超感知范式。

Method: 提出空间超感知的四个阶段框架，开发VSI-SUPER基准测试（包含VSR和VSC任务），训练Cambrian-S模型，并引入基于预测误差的自监督下一潜在帧预测器方法。

Result: 在VSI-Bench上获得+30%绝对改进，但在VSI-SUPER上表现仍有限；预测性感知方法显著优于领先的专有基线模型。

Conclusion: 空间超感知需要模型不仅能看，还要能预测、选择和组织经验，预测性感知是实现真正空间智能的关键路径。

Abstract: We argue that progress in true multimodal intelligence calls for a shift from
reactive, task-driven systems and brute-force long context towards a broader
paradigm of supersensing. We frame spatial supersensing as four stages beyond
linguistic-only understanding: semantic perception (naming what is seen),
streaming event cognition (maintaining memory across continuous experiences),
implicit 3D spatial cognition (inferring the world behind pixels), and
predictive world modeling (creating internal models that filter and organize
information). Current benchmarks largely test only the early stages, offering
narrow coverage of spatial cognition and rarely challenging models in ways that
require true world modeling. To drive progress in spatial supersensing, we
present VSI-SUPER, a two-part benchmark: VSR (long-horizon visual spatial
recall) and VSC (continual visual spatial counting). These tasks require
arbitrarily long video inputs yet are resistant to brute-force context
expansion. We then test data scaling limits by curating VSI-590K and training
Cambrian-S, achieving +30% absolute improvement on VSI-Bench without
sacrificing general capabilities. Yet performance on VSI-SUPER remains limited,
indicating that scale alone is insufficient for spatial supersensing. We
propose predictive sensing as a path forward, presenting a proof-of-concept in
which a self-supervised next-latent-frame predictor leverages surprise
(prediction error) to drive memory and event segmentation. On VSI-SUPER, this
approach substantially outperforms leading proprietary baselines, showing that
spatial supersensing requires models that not only see but also anticipate,
select, and organize experience.

Conclusion: InfinityStar是首个能够生成工业级720p视频的离散自回归视频生成器，释放了所有代码和模型以促进高效、高质量视频生成的研究。

Abstract: We introduce InfinityStar, a unified spacetime autoregressive framework for
high-resolution image and dynamic video synthesis. Building on the recent
success of autoregressive modeling in both vision and language, our purely
discrete approach jointly captures spatial and temporal dependencies within a
single architecture. This unified design naturally supports a variety of
generation tasks such as text-to-image, text-to-video, image-to-video, and long
interactive video synthesis via straightforward temporal autoregression.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that InfinityStar scores 83.74 on VBench,
outperforming all autoregressive models by large margins, even surpassing some
diffusion competitors like HunyuanVideo. Without extra optimizations, our model
generates a 5s, 720p video approximately 10x faster than leading

Motivation: 现实世界中的物体经常发生状态转换（如苹果被切成块、蝴蝶破茧而出），现有方法在物体外观显著变化后容易丢失跟踪目标，需要解决这一限制。

Method: 提出TubeletGraph零样本系统，通过识别可能被忽略的轨迹，基于语义和邻近性先验决定是否整合，然后对添加的轨迹进行推理并生成描述每个观察到的转换的状态图。

Result: TubeletGraph在状态转换下实现了最先进的跟踪性能，展示了对物体转换的深入理解，以及在复杂物体转换的时间定位和语义推理方面的有前景能力。

Conclusion: TubeletGraph能够有效跟踪经过状态转换的物体，同时检测和描述状态变化，为理解现实世界物体和动态提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Real-world objects frequently undergo state transformations. From an apple
being cut into pieces to a butterfly emerging from its cocoon, tracking through
these changes is important for understanding real-world objects and dynamics.
However, existing methods often lose track of the target object after
transformation, due to significant changes in object appearance. To address
this limitation, we introduce the task of Track Any State: tracking objects
through transformations while detecting and describing state changes,
accompanied by a new benchmark dataset, VOST-TAS. To tackle this problem, we
present TubeletGraph, a zero-shot system that recovers missing objects after
transformation and maps out how object states are evolving over time.
TubeletGraph first identifies potentially overlooked tracks, and determines
whether they should be integrated based on semantic and proximity priors. Then,
it reasons about the added tracks and generates a state graph describing each
observed transformation. TubeletGraph achieves state-of-the-art tracking
performance under transformations, while demonstrating deeper understanding of
object transformations and promising capabilities in temporal grounding and
semantic reasoning for complex object transformations. Code, additional
results, and the benchmark dataset are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在生成中表现出隐式人格特质，但可靠控制或对齐这些特质以满足特定需求仍是一个开放挑战，需要有效的模型行为操纵机制。

Method: 从Transformer层提取大五人格特质相关的隐藏状态激活，应用低秩子空间发现方法，识别特质特定最优层，通过动态层选择和扰动实现人格对齐方向的操作化。

Result: 发现人格特质占据低秩共享子空间，这些潜在结构可通过精心扰动转化为有效的操控机制，不影响流畅性、方差和通用能力。

Conclusion: 该框架有助于弥合心理学理论与实际模型对齐之间的差距，为人格感知LLM提供了可行的行为操控方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models exhibit implicit personalities in their generation, but
reliably controlling or aligning these traits to meet specific needs remains an
open challenge. The need for effective mechanisms for behavioural manipulation
of the model during generation is a critical gap in the literature that needs
to be fulfilled. Personality-aware LLMs hold a promising direction towards this
objective. However, the relationship between these psychological constructs and
their representations within LLMs remains underexplored and requires further
investigation. Moreover, it is intriguing to understand and study the use of
these representations to steer the models' behaviour. We propose a novel
pipeline that extracts hidden state activations from transformer layers using
the Big Five Personality Traits (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion,
Agreeableness and Neuroticism), which is a comprehensive and empirically
validated framework to model human personality applies low-rank subspace
discovery methods, and identifies trait-specific optimal layers across
different model architectures for robust injection. The resulting
personality-aligned directions are then operationalised through a flexible
steering framework with dynamic layer selection, enabling precise control of
trait expression in LLM outputs. Our findings reveal that personality traits
occupy a low-rank shared subspace, and that these latent structures can be
transformed into actionable mechanisms for effective steering through careful
perturbations without impacting the fluency, variance and general capabilities,
helping to bridge the gap between psychological theory and practical model

### [65] [TextualVerifier: Verify TextGrad Step-by-Step](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03739)
*Eugenius Mario Situmorang,Adila Alfa Krisnadhi,Ari Wibisono*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TextualVerifier是一个为TextGrad设计的自验证框架，通过思维链分解、变体生成、多数投票和共识聚合四阶段工作流，使用大语言模型验证文本推理的有效性，显著提升了推理步骤的有效性和优化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TextGrad作为文本自动微分方法，在文本优化中缺乏确保推理有效性的自验证机制，这限制了其在复杂决策任务中的可靠性。

Method: 采用四阶段工作流：思维链分解、变体生成、多数投票和共识聚合，使用大语言模型进行验证，并与TextGrad在损失函数和优化结果验证阶段进行非侵入式集成。

Result: 在PRM800K上推理步骤有效性提升29%；与TextGrad集成后在GPQA-Diamond、MMLU-ML和MMLU-CP基准测试中分别获得8.08、10.71和3.92个百分点的性能提升，损失函数集成使准确率从68.2%提升至70.4%。

Conclusion: TextualVerifier是首个基于大语言模型的TextGrad自验证框架，无需数值梯度即可实现更可靠的文本推理，为文本优化验证开辟了新方向。

Abstract: TextGrad is a novel approach to text-based automatic differentiation that
enables composite AI systems to perform optimization without explicit numerical
equations. However, it currently lacks self-verification mechanisms that ensure
reasoning validity in text-based decision making. This research introduces
TextualVerifier, a verification framework that leverages chain-of-thought
reasoning and majority voting with large language models to address this
verification gap. TextualVerifier implements a four-stage workflow:
chain-of-thought decomposition, variant generation, majority voting, and
consensus aggregation. It integrates non-invasively with TextGrad at both the
loss function and optimization result verification stages. Experimental
evaluation using the Gemini 1.5 Pro model is conducted in two phases: (1)
standalone evaluation on PRM800K, and (2) integrated evaluation with TextGrad
on GPQA-Diamond, MMLU-ML, and MMLU-CP benchmarks. Results show statistically
significant improvements (p < 0.001). In phase one, TextualVerifier improves
the validity of reasoning steps by 29 percent. In phase two, integration into
TextGrad loss function yields a 2.2 percentage point gain from 68.2 to 70.4
percent with a moderate overhead of 5.9 LLM calls on average. Further
evaluations of TextualVerifier versioning yield 8.08, 10.71, and 3.92
percentage point improvements on GPQA, MMLU-ML, and MMLU-CP respectively.
TextualVerifier thus presents the first self-verification framework for
TextGrad through LLM-based techniques without requiring numerical gradients,
enabling more reliable reasoning and opening new directions for verification in
text-based optimization.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) play a central role in modern artificial
intelligence, yet their development has been primarily focused on English,
resulting in limited support for other languages. We present PLLuM (Polish
Large Language Model), the largest open-source family of foundation models
tailored specifically for the Polish language. Developed by a consortium of
major Polish research institutions, PLLuM addresses the need for high-quality,
transparent, and culturally relevant language models beyond the English-centric
commercial landscape. We describe the development process, including the
construction of a new 140-billion-token Polish text corpus for pre-training, a
77k custom instructions dataset, and a 100k preference optimization dataset. A
key component is a Responsible AI framework that incorporates strict data
governance and a hybrid module for output correction and safety filtering. We
detail the models' architecture, training procedures, and alignment techniques
for both base and instruction-tuned variants, and demonstrate their utility in
a downstream task within public administration. By releasing these models
publicly, PLLuM aims to foster open research and strengthen sovereign AI
technologies in Poland.

*Mohammad Atif Quamar,Mohammad Areeb,Mikhail Kuznetsov,Muslum Ozgur Ozmen,Z. Berkay Celik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: STARS是一种解码时算法，通过迭代采样、评分和拒绝/接受固定大小的短令牌段来引导模型生成，显著提高计算效率和对齐质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型对齐方法如微调计算成本高且效果不理想，而推理时方法如Best-of-N采样需要不切实际的计算量才能达到最优对齐。

Method: STARS采用分段级令牌对齐与拒绝采样，在解码时迭代采样、评分和拒绝/接受固定大小的短令牌段，实现生成路径的早期修正。

Result: 在六个LLM测试中，STARS在胜率上比监督微调(SFT)高出14.9个百分点，比直接偏好优化(DPO)高出4.3个百分点，与强Best-of-N基线保持高度竞争力。

Conclusion: 细粒度、奖励引导的采样是传统微调和全序列排序方法的一种通用、鲁棒且高效的大语言模型对齐替代方案。

Abstract: Aligning large language models with human values is crucial for their safe
deployment; however, existing methods, such as fine-tuning, are computationally
expensive and suboptimal. In contrast, inference-time approaches like Best-of-N
sampling require practically infeasible computation to achieve optimal
alignment. We propose STARS: Segment-level Token Alignment with Rejection
Sampling, a decoding-time algorithm that steers model generation by iteratively
sampling, scoring, and rejecting/accepting short, fixed-size token segments.
This allows for early correction of the generation path, significantly
improving computational efficiency and boosting alignment quality. Across a
suite of six LLMs, we show that STARS outperforms Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)
by up to 14.9 percentage points and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) by up
to 4.3 percentage points on win-rates, while remaining highly competitive with
strong Best-of-N baselines. Our work establishes granular, reward-guided
sampling as a generalizable, robust, and efficient alternative to traditional
fine-tuning and full-sequence ranking methods for aligning LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的多标签文本分类方法，将分类任务重新表述为一系列二分（是/否）决策序列，结合前缀缓存机制，在不损失准确性的情况下显著提升短文本推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在多标签文本分类中的效率问题，特别是在短文本推理场景下，通过任务分解和缓存优化来提升性能。

Method: 将多标签分类分解为独立的二分查询，结合前缀缓存机制；使用LLM-to-SLM蒸馏技术，通过强大的标注模型（DeepSeek-V3）生成多个标注来微调较小模型。

Result: 微调后的模型在零样本基线上显示出显著改进，特别是在训练期间见过的维度上；该方法在情感文本分析（24个维度）上得到验证。

Conclusion: 将多标签分类分解为二分查询，结合蒸馏和缓存感知推理，为基于LLM的分类提供了一个可扩展且有效的框架，该方法具有通用性，可跨领域应用。

Abstract: We introduce a method for efficient multi-label text classification with
large language models (LLMs), built on reformulating classification tasks as
sequences of dichotomic (yes/no) decisions. Instead of generating all labels in
a single structured response, each target dimension is queried independently,
which, combined with a prefix caching mechanism, yields substantial efficiency
gains for short-text inference without loss of accuracy. To demonstrate the
approach, we focus on affective text analysis, covering 24 dimensions including
emotions and sentiment. Using LLM-to-SLM distillation, a powerful annotator
model (DeepSeek-V3) provides multiple annotations per text, which are
aggregated to fine-tune smaller models (HerBERT-Large, CLARIN-1B, PLLuM-8B,
Gemma3-1B). The fine-tuned models show significant improvements over zero-shot
baselines, particularly on the dimensions seen during training. Our findings
suggest that decomposing multi-label classification into dichotomic queries,
combined with distillation and cache-aware inference, offers a scalable and
effective framework for LLM-based classification. While we validate the method
on affective states, the approach is general and applicable across domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着低资源语言被纳入NLP研究，大规模数据集收集过程中存在重数量轻质量的风险，可能导致技术性能差和产生有害偏见内容

Method: 研究三种低资源语言（阿法尔奥罗莫语、阿姆哈拉语、提格里尼亚语）的机器翻译数据集，重点关注性别表征质量

Result: 发现训练数据偏向政治宗教领域，基准数据集聚焦新闻健康体育；存在明显的男性偏向（人名、动词性别、刻板印象）；发现针对女性的有害和毒性描述，数据量最大的语言问题最突出

Conclusion: 数量不能保证质量，需要进一步调查低资源语言数据集并及早缓解有害内容

Abstract: As low-resourced languages are increasingly incorporated into NLP research,
there is an emphasis on collecting large-scale datasets. But in prioritizing
quantity over quality, we risk 1) building language technologies that perform
poorly for these languages and 2) producing harmful content that perpetuates
societal biases. In this paper, we investigate the quality of Machine
Translation (MT) datasets for three low-resourced languages--Afan Oromo,
Amharic, and Tigrinya, with a focus on the gender representation in the
datasets. Our findings demonstrate that while training data has a large
representation of political and religious domain text, benchmark datasets are
focused on news, health, and sports. We also found a large skew towards the
male gender--in names of persons, the grammatical gender of verbs, and in
stereotypical depictions in the datasets. Further, we found harmful and toxic
depictions against women, which were more prominent for the language with the
largest amount of data, underscoring that quantity does not guarantee quality.
We hope that our work inspires further inquiry into the datasets collected for
low-resourced languages and prompts early mitigation of harmful content.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GRAD是一种解码时方法，通过构建稀疏令牌转移图来缓解LLM幻觉问题，无需重新训练模型，在多个问答基准测试中显著提升准确性和降低幻觉率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缓解LLM幻觉的方法依赖外部知识源，但基于提示的方法脆弱且领域敏感，符号知识集成则成本高昂。受知识图谱启发，希望开发一种轻量级、即插即用的方法。

Method: GRAD通过单次前向传播在检索语料上累积下一个令牌的logits来构建稀疏令牌转移图，在解码时对图检索的logits进行最大归一化，并与模型logits自适应融合，优先选择高证据延续。

Result: 在三个模型和多个问答基准测试中，GRAD始终优于基线方法，内在准确率提高9.7%，幻觉率降低8.6%，正确性提高6.9%，在所有方法中获得最高的真实-信息性乘积分数。

Conclusion: GRAD提供了一种轻量级、即插即用的替代方案，证明了从语料级令牌转移中获得的统计证据可以有效引导生成更真实和可验证的输出。

Abstract: Hallucination mitigation remains a persistent challenge for large language
models (LLMs), even as model scales grow. Existing approaches often rely on
external knowledge sources, such as structured databases or knowledge graphs,
accessed through prompting or retrieval. However, prompt-based grounding is
fragile and domain-sensitive, while symbolic knowledge integration incurs heavy
retrieval and formatting costs. Motivated by knowledge graphs, we introduce
Graph-Retrieved Adaptive Decoding (GRAD), a decoding-time method that grounds
generation in corpus-derived evidence without retraining. GRAD constructs a
sparse token transition graph by accumulating next-token logits across a small
retrieved corpus in a single forward pass. During decoding, graph-retrieved
logits are max-normalized and adaptively fused with model logits to favor
high-evidence continuations while preserving fluency. Across three models and a
range of question-answering benchmarks spanning intrinsic, extrinsic
hallucination, and factuality tasks, GRAD consistently surpasses baselines,
achieving up to 9.7$\%$ higher intrinsic accuracy, 8.6$\%$ lower hallucination
rates, and 6.9$\%$ greater correctness compared to greedy decoding, while
attaining the highest truth--informativeness product score among all methods.
GRAD offers a lightweight, plug-and-play alternative to contrastive decoding
and knowledge graph augmentation, demonstrating that statistical evidence from
corpus-level token transitions can effectively steer generation toward more
truthful and verifiable outputs.

Motivation: 测试智能体在多轮语言环境中进行上下文敏感语用推理的能力，通过迭代参考游戏来评估人类和视觉语言模型的表现。

Method: 使用迭代参考游戏实验，改变上下文的数量、顺序和相关性，比较人类和视觉语言模型在不同上下文条件下的表现。

Result: 无相关上下文时，模型表现优于随机但远不如人类；有相关上下文时，模型性能随试验次数显著提升；抽象指称物的少样本参考游戏对机器学习模型仍是困难任务。

Conclusion: 上下文相关性对模型性能有重要影响，相关上下文能显著提升模型表现，但抽象指称物的少样本参考游戏仍是机器学习模型的挑战。

Abstract: Iterated reference games - in which players repeatedly pick out novel
referents using language - present a test case for agents' ability to perform
context-sensitive pragmatic reasoning in multi-turn linguistic environments. We
tested humans and vision-language models on trials from iterated reference
games, varying the given context in terms of amount, order, and relevance.
Without relevant context, models were above chance but substantially worse than
humans. However, with relevant context, model performance increased
dramatically over trials. Few-shot reference games with abstract referents
remain a difficult task for machine learning models.

Motivation: 量化人类繁荣这一多维概念对于理解超越经济指标的社会福祉至关重要，现有测量方法缺乏精细的空间和时间分辨率。

Method: 分析2013-2023年约26亿条美国地理定位推文，使用微调的大语言模型对48个与哈佛全球繁荣研究框架一致的指标进行分类，包括对移民态度和腐败感知。

Abstract: Quantifying human flourishing, a multidimensional construct including
happiness, health, purpose, virtue, relationships, and financial stability, is
critical for understanding societal well-being beyond economic indicators.
Existing measures often lack fine spatial and temporal resolution. Here we
introduce the Human Flourishing Geographic Index (HFGI), derived from analyzing
approximately 2.6 billion geolocated U.S. tweets (2013-2023) using fine-tuned
large language models to classify expressions across 48 indicators aligned with
Harvard's Global Flourishing Study framework plus attitudes towards migration
and perception of corruption. The dataset offers monthly and yearly county- and
state-level indicators of flourishing-related discourse, validated to confirm
that the measures accurately represent the underlying constructs and show
expected correlations with established indicators. This resource enables
multidisciplinary analyses of well-being, inequality, and social change at

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通过向量翻译在多智能体系统中实现跨模型语义通信的方法，而不是传递原始token，从而减少计算开销并改善信息传输。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多智能体环境中，LLMs通常以原始token形式传递消息，这丢弃了大部分潜在语义信息，限制了信息传输效率并增加了不必要的计算开销。

Method: 使用学习到的映射函数在表示空间之间建立潜在桥梁，实现直接语义交换。训练了Llama-2-7B和Mistral-7B-Instruct之间的双编码器翻译器。

Result: 翻译器达到平均余弦对齐度0.538，以30%混合强度注入翻译向量可以引导目标模型生成而不破坏logits稳定性。双向评估显示2.01:1的传输不对称性。

Conclusion: 这种保守注入方法保持了计算稳定性，证明跨模型潜在通信是可行的，使协作AI系统能够共享意义而非token。

Abstract: In multi-agent settings, such as debate, reflection, or tool-calling, large
language models (LLMs) pass messages as plain tokens, discarding most latent
semantics. This constrains information transfer and adds unnecessary
computational overhead. We form a latent bridge via vector translations, which
use learned mappings that enable direct semantic exchange between
representation spaces. A dual-encoder translator trained between Llama-2-7B and
Mistral-7B-Instruct attains an average cosine alignment of 0.538. Injecting the
translated vectors at 30 percent blending strength steers the target model's
generation without destabilizing logits. Bidirectional evaluation shows a
2.01:1 transfer asymmetry, indicating that general-purpose models yield more
transferable representations than instruction-tuned variants. This conservative
injection preserves computational stability while demonstrating that
cross-model latent communication is feasible, enabling collaborative AI systems
that share meaning rather than tokens.

Motivation: RAG管道在检索证据不完整时经常失败，导致推理过程存在空白。溯因推理能够生成合理的缺失前提来解释观察结果，为填补这些空白提供了原则性方法。

Method: 提出整合溯因推理的框架：检测证据不足、生成候选缺失前提、通过一致性和合理性检查进行验证。

Result: 在溯因推理和多跳QA基准测试上的实验结果表明，该方法提高了答案准确性和推理可信度。

Conclusion: 溯因推理是增强RAG系统鲁棒性和可解释性的有前景方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enhanced with retrieval -- commonly referred to
as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) -- have demonstrated strong performance
in knowledge-intensive tasks. However, RAG pipelines often fail when retrieved
evidence is incomplete, leaving gaps in the reasoning process. In such cases,
\emph{abductive inference} -- the process of generating plausible missing
premises to explain observations -- offers a principled approach to bridge
these gaps. In this paper, we propose a framework that integrates abductive
inference into retrieval-augmented LLMs. Our method detects insufficient
evidence, generates candidate missing premises, and validates them through
consistency and plausibility checks. Experimental results on abductive
reasoning and multi-hop QA benchmarks show that our approach improves both
answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness. This work highlights abductive
inference as a promising direction for enhancing the robustness and
explainability of RAG systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RNN-T在端到端语音识别中依赖大规模高质量标注数据，但这些数据成本高且难以获取。

Method: 设计灵活的训练图，无需额外置信度估计或预训练模型，就能鲁棒处理转录错误。

Result: 在合成和工业数据集上的实验表明，WST在转录错误率高达70%时仍能有效维持性能，优于BTC和OTC等CTC基方法。

Conclusion: WST在实际ASR场景中具有实用性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The Recurrent Neural Network-Transducer (RNN-T) is widely adopted in
end-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks but depends heavily
on large-scale, high-quality annotated data, which are often costly and
difficult to obtain. To mitigate this reliance, we propose a Weakly Supervised
Transducer (WST), which integrates a flexible training graph designed to
robustly handle errors in the transcripts without requiring additional
confidence estimation or auxiliary pre-trained models. Empirical evaluations on
synthetic and industrial datasets reveal that WST effectively maintains
performance even with transcription error rates of up to 70%, consistently
outperforming existing Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)-based weakly
supervised approaches, such as Bypass Temporal Classification (BTC) and
Omni-Temporal Classification (OTC). These results demonstrate the practical
utility and robustness of WST in realistic ASR settings. The implementation
will be publicly available.

Motivation: 当前LLM解释评估主要关注表面合理性或内部一致性，但无法确保解释内容真正符合领域专家的专业判断和推理方式。

Method: 与领域专家合作开发T-FIX基准，涵盖七个知识密集型领域，并创建新的指标来测量LLM解释与专家判断的对齐程度。

Result: 开发了T-FIX基准和相应的专家对齐评估指标，为知识密集型应用中LLM解释质量提供了更严格的评估框架。

Conclusion: 专家对齐是评估LLM解释质量的关键标准，T-FIX基准为这一目标提供了系统化的评估工具。

Abstract: As LLMs are deployed in knowledge-intensive settings (e.g., surgery,
astronomy, therapy), users expect not just answers, but also meaningful
explanations for those answers. In these settings, users are often domain
experts (e.g., doctors, astrophysicists, psychologists) who require
explanations that reflect expert-level reasoning. However, current evaluation
schemes primarily emphasize plausibility or internal faithfulness of the
explanation, which fail to capture whether the content of the explanation truly
aligns with expert intuition. We formalize expert alignment as a criterion for
evaluating explanations with T-FIX, a benchmark spanning seven
knowledge-intensive domains. In collaboration with domain experts, we develop
novel metrics to measure the alignment of LLM explanations with expert
judgment.

Result: 在四个基准TKGQA数据集上的实验表明，PoK显著提高了LLMs的检索精度和推理准确率，最多超越最先进TKGQA方法56.0%

Conclusion: 通过结合结构化规划和时序知识检索，PoK有效增强了时序推理的可解释性和事实一致性

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graph Question Answering (TKGQA) aims to answer
time-sensitive questions by leveraging factual information from Temporal
Knowledge Graphs (TKGs). While previous studies have employed pre-trained TKG
embeddings or graph neural networks to inject temporal knowledge, they fail to
fully understand the complex semantic information of time constraints.
Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress,
benefiting from their strong semantic understanding and reasoning
generalization capabilities. However, their temporal reasoning ability remains
limited. LLMs frequently suffer from hallucination and a lack of knowledge. To
address these limitations, we propose the Plan of Knowledge framework with a
contrastive temporal retriever, which is named PoK. Specifically, the proposed
Plan of Knowledge module decomposes a complex temporal question into a sequence
of sub-objectives from the pre-defined tools, serving as intermediate guidance
for reasoning exploration. In parallel, we construct a Temporal Knowledge Store
(TKS) with a contrastive retrieval framework, enabling the model to selectively
retrieve semantically and temporally aligned facts from TKGs. By combining
structured planning with temporal knowledge retrieval, PoK effectively enhances
the interpretability and factual consistency of temporal reasoning. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark TKGQA datasets demonstrate that PoK significantly
improves the retrieval precision and reasoning accuracy of LLMs, surpassing the
performance of the state-of-the-art TKGQA methods by 56.0% at most.

TL;DR: 比较人类与大型语言模型在情感词汇联想上的差异，发现LLMs的联想更可预测、缺乏创造性，且会放大刺激词的情感负荷


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索人类与大型语言模型在词汇联想行为上的异同，特别是对情感词汇的联想方式，以了解LLMs是否能够模拟人类的创造性联想机制

Method: 通过比较人类参与者和大型语言模型对情感词汇的联想反应，分析联想重叠度、情感放大效应和创造性差异

Result: 人类与LLMs的联想重叠度中等，但LLMs的联想更可预测、缺乏创造性，且会放大刺激词的情感负荷

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在词汇联想方面与人类存在显著差异，其联想行为更模式化且会强化情感倾向，缺乏人类联想的创造性和多样性

Abstract: Human word associations are a well-known method of gaining insight into the
internal mental lexicon, but the responses spontaneously offered by human
participants to word cues are not always predictable as they may be influenced
by personal experience, emotions or individual cognitive styles. The ability to
form associative links between seemingly unrelated concepts can be the driving
mechanisms of creativity. We perform a comparison of the associative behaviour
of humans compared to large language models. More specifically, we explore
associations to emotionally loaded words and try to determine whether large
language models generate associations in a similar way to humans. We find that
the overlap between humans and LLMs is moderate, but also that the associations
of LLMs tend to amplify the underlying emotional load of the stimulus, and that
they tend to be more predictable and less creative than human ones.

Motivation: 提升放射学报告中受保护健康信息的自动去识别能力，解决跨机构泛化问题和确保数据隐私安全。

Method: 在斯坦福大学的大型放射学报告语料库上微调最先进的Transformer模型，引入新的PHI类别(AGE)，采用"隐藏于众目睽睽之下"的合成PHI生成方法进行评估。

Result: 模型在宾大和斯坦福测试集上分别获得0.973和0.996的F1分数，合成PHI检测F1为0.959，显著优于所有商业系统(0.632-0.754)。

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的去识别模型在多样化放射学数据集上训练后，在PHI检测方面建立了新的性能基准，为安全的临床文本处理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Objective: To enhance automated de-identification of radiology reports by
scaling transformer-based models through extensive training datasets and
benchmarking performance against commercial cloud vendor systems for protected
health information (PHI) detection. Materials and Methods: In this
retrospective study, we built upon a state-of-the-art, transformer-based, PHI
de-identification pipeline by fine-tuning on two large annotated radiology
corpora from Stanford University, encompassing chest X-ray, chest CT,
abdomen/pelvis CT, and brain MR reports and introducing an additional PHI
category (AGE) into the architecture. Model performance was evaluated on test
sets from Stanford and the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) for token-level
PHI detection. We further assessed (1) the stability of synthetic PHI
generation using a "hide-in-plain-sight" method and (2) performance against
commercial systems. Precision, recall, and F1 scores were computed across all
PHI categories. Results: Our model achieved overall F1 scores of 0.973 on the
Penn dataset and 0.996 on the Stanford dataset, outperforming or maintaining
the previous state-of-the-art model performance. Synthetic PHI evaluation
showed consistent detectability (overall F1: 0.959 [0.958-0.960]) across 50
independently de-identified Penn datasets. Our model outperformed all vendor
systems on synthetic Penn reports (overall F1: 0.960 vs. 0.632-0.754).
Discussion: Large-scale, multimodal training improved cross-institutional
generalization and robustness. Synthetic PHI generation preserved data utility
while ensuring privacy. Conclusion: A transformer-based de-identification model
trained on diverse radiology datasets outperforms prior academic and commercial
systems in PHI detection and establishes a new benchmark for secure clinical
text processing.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了k-列表语言识别问题，在传统语言识别基础上允许学习者每次输出k个猜测。论文给出了k-列表识别的精确特征化，并建立了统计学习环境下的识别速率界限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典的语言识别在极限中是不可能的，但最近在语言生成方面的积极结果促使重新审视这个问题。通过给学习者额外的能力（每次输出k个猜测），可以扩展可识别语言类的范围。

Method: 基于Angluin经典特征化的递归版本，给出了k-列表识别的精确特征化：一个语言集合可以k-列表识别当且仅当它可以分解为k个可识别（列表大小为1）的语言集合。

Result: 建立了k-列表识别的完整特征化，并证明如果集合是k-列表可识别的，则可以达到指数级识别速率；如果不可识别，则任何趋近于零的速率都不可能。

Conclusion: k-列表识别为语言识别提供了更强的能力，其特征化具有概念上的吸引力，且指数级识别速率是最优的。

Abstract: We study the problem of language identification in the limit, where given a
sequence of examples from a target language, the goal of the learner is to
output a sequence of guesses for the target language such that all the guesses
beyond some finite time are correct. Classical results of Gold showed that
language identification in the limit is impossible for essentially any
interesting collection of languages. Later, Angluin gave a precise
characterization of language collections for which this task is possible.
Motivated by recent positive results for the related problem of language
generation, we revisit the classic language identification problem in the
setting where the learner is given the additional power of producing a list of
$k$ guesses at each time step. The goal is to ensure that beyond some finite
time, one of the guesses is correct at each time step.
  We give an exact characterization of collections of languages that can be
$k$-list identified in the limit, based on a recursive version of Angluin's
characterization (for language identification with a list of size $1$). This
further leads to a conceptually appealing characterization: A language
collection can be $k$-list identified in the limit if and only if the
collection can be decomposed into $k$ collections of languages, each of which
can be identified in the limit (with a list of size $1$). We also use our
characterization to establish rates for list identification in the statistical
setting where the input is drawn as an i.i.d. stream from a distribution
supported on some language in the collection. Our results show that if a
collection is $k$-list identifiable in the limit, then the collection can be
$k$-list identified at an exponential rate, and this is best possible. On the
other hand, if a collection is not $k$-list identifiable in the limit, then it
cannot be $k$-list identified at any rate that goes to zero.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注批处理在降低推理成本方面的作用，但忽视了其在正则化模型行为方面的潜在价值，特别是在多步推理任务中。

Method: 在13个多样化基准测试上进行综合研究，通过行为分析探索批处理对模型推理行为的影响，包括过度思考、犹豫语言和集体效应等方面。

Result: 批处理显著提高了准确性，同时大幅减少推理令牌使用量（通常减少3-5倍），抑制了过度思考，减少了犹豫语言，并促进了更果断的答案。

Conclusion: 批处理不仅是吞吐量优化工具，更是强大的推理时正则化器，能够实现更高效可靠的大语言模型推理。

Abstract: Recent work has explored batch prompting as a strategy to amortize inference
cost in large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we show that batching
offers an additional, underappreciated benefit: it regularizes model behavior
during multi-step reasoning for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). We conduct a
comprehensive study across 13 diverse benchmarks and observe that batching
improves accuracy while substantially reducing reasoning token usage, often by
3x-5x. Through detailed behavioral analysis, we find that batching suppresses
overthinking, reduces hedging language (e.g., repetitive self-corrections), and
encourages more decisive answers. Surprisingly, we also observe emergent
collective effects in batched inference: models often generalize patterns from
earlier examples to solve harder ones in the same batch. These findings
position batching not just as a throughput optimization, but as a powerful
inference-time regularizer for more efficient and reliable LLM reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在数学推理任务上的高表现可能源于训练数据泄露或表面模式匹配，而非真正的推理能力，需要对抗性评估来测量真实能力。

Method: 使用35个LLMs模拟学生，构建难度排名器，通过强化学习指导问题重写模型生成不同难度级别的数学问题变体。

Result: 在竞赛级数学基准测试中，RIDE生成的扰动版本使先进LLMs性能平均下降21.73%，暴露了数学推理的有限鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RIDE框架有效揭示了LLMs数学推理能力的局限性，验证了该评估方法的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve high performance on mathematical
reasoning, but these results can be inflated by training data leakage or
superficial pattern matching rather than genuine reasoning. To this end, an
adversarial perturbation-based evaluation is needed to measure true
mathematical reasoning ability. Current rule-based perturbation methods often
generate ill-posed questions and impede the systematic evaluation of question
difficulty and the evolution of benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we propose
RIDE, a novel adversarial question-rewriting framework that leverages Item
Response Theory (IRT) to rigorously measure question difficulty and to generate
intrinsically more challenging, well-posed variations of mathematical problems.
We employ 35 LLMs to simulate students and build a difficulty ranker from their
responses. This ranker provides a reward signal during reinforcement learning
and guides a question-rewriting model to reformulate existing questions across
difficulty levels. Applying RIDE to competition-level mathematical benchmarks
yields perturbed versions that degrade advanced LLM performance, with
experiments showing an average 21.73% drop across 26 models, thereby exposing
limited robustness in mathematical reasoning and confirming the validity of our
evaluation approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 粤语ASR面临低资源、六声调、变调和口音变化等挑战，现有模型如Whisper词错误率高，需要整合声学线索和语言模型推理能力。

Method: 使用强制对齐提取声学特征，LoRA微调Whisper改进音调识别，指令调优Qwen-Audio进行韵律感知校正。

Result: 在自发粤语数据上的评估显示，相比Whisper-Large-V3取得了显著的字符错误率提升。

Conclusion: 整合声学线索与LALM推理为低资源声调语言和方言ASR提供了可扩展策略。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) is critical for language accessibility,
yet low-resource Cantonese remains challenging due to limited annotated data,
six lexical tones, tone sandhi, and accent variation. Existing ASR models, such
as Whisper, often suffer from high word error rates. Large audio-language
models (LALMs), in contrast, can leverage broader contextual reasoning but
still require explicit tonal and prosodic acoustic cues. We introduce CantoASR,
a collaborative ASR-LALM error correction framework that integrates forced
alignment for acoustic feature extraction, a LoRA-finetuned Whisper for
improved tone discrimination, and an instruction-tuned Qwen-Audio for
prosody-aware correction. Evaluations on spontaneous Cantonese data show
substantial CER gains over Whisper-Large-V3. These findings suggest that
integrating acoustic cues with LALM reasoning provides a scalable strategy for
low-resource tonal and dialectal ASR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在从自然语言生成SQL时面临模式规模大和复杂推理的挑战，先前工作主要关注复杂不实用的流水线，而忽略了小型高效模型。

Method: 提出了三种多智能体LLM流水线：(1)多智能体讨论流水线，智能体迭代批判和优化SQL查询；(2)规划器-编码器流水线，思考模型规划器生成分步SQL生成计划；(3)编码器-聚合器流水线，多个编码器独立生成SQL，推理智能体选择最佳查询。

Result: 在Bird-Bench Mini-Dev集上的实验显示，多智能体讨论可将Qwen2.5-7b-Instruct的执行准确率提升10.6%。LLM规划器-编码器流水线效果最好，DeepSeek-R1-32B和QwQ-32B规划器将Gemma 3 27B IT准确率从52.4%提升到56.4%。

Conclusion: 多智能体方法能有效提升文本到SQL系统的性能，特别是规划器-编码器流水线在提升模型准确率方面表现最佳。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems provide a natural language interface that can enable even
laymen to access information stored in databases. However, existing Large
Language Models (LLM) struggle with SQL generation from natural instructions
due to large schema sizes and complex reasoning. Prior work often focuses on
complex, somewhat impractical pipelines using flagship models, while smaller,
efficient models remain overlooked. In this work, we explore three multi-agent
LLM pipelines, with systematic performance benchmarking across a range of small
to large open-source models: (1) Multi-agent discussion pipeline, where agents
iteratively critique and refine SQL queries, and a judge synthesizes the final
answer; (2) Planner-Coder pipeline, where a thinking model planner generates
stepwise SQL generation plans and a coder synthesizes queries; and (3)
Coder-Aggregator pipeline, where multiple coders independently generate SQL
queries, and a reasoning agent selects the best query. Experiments on the
Bird-Bench Mini-Dev set reveal that Multi-Agent discussion can improve small
model performance, with up to 10.6% increase in Execution Accuracy for
Qwen2.5-7b-Instruct seen after three rounds of discussion. Among the pipelines,
the LLM Reasoner-Coder pipeline yields the best results, with DeepSeek-R1-32B
and QwQ-32B planners boosting Gemma 3 27B IT accuracy from 52.4% to the highest
score of 56.4%. Codes are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LAAC提出将LLM作为智能通信中介，通过结构化对话捕获发送者意图，促进真实知识交流，避免AI生成内容的膨胀-压缩循环。但部署LLM作为可信通信中介需要解决信息保真度、一致性和可靠性等信任问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI生成内容泛滥导致通信剧场化，发送者用LLM将简单想法膨胀为冗长内容，接收者用LLM压缩回摘要，双方都不接触真实内容。需要改变这种低效通信模式。

Method: 提出LAAC框架，将LLM定位为智能通信中介，通过多智能体架构进行结构化对话捕获意图。通过控制实验评估三个信任维度：信息捕获保真度、可重现性和查询响应完整性。

Result: 初步发现存在可测量的信任差距，在高风险通信场景部署前需要解决这些问题。

Conclusion: LAAC有潜力改变AI辅助通信模式，但需要先解决信任维度的问题才能可靠部署。

Abstract: The proliferation of AI-generated content has created an absurd communication
theater where senders use LLMs to inflate simple ideas into verbose content,
recipients use LLMs to compress them back into summaries, and as a consequence
neither party engage with authentic content. LAAC (LLM as a Communicator)
proposes a paradigm shift - positioning LLMs as intelligent communication
intermediaries that capture the sender's intent through structured dialogue and
facilitate genuine knowledge exchange with recipients. Rather than perpetuating
cycles of AI-generated inflation and compression, LAAC enables authentic
communication across diverse contexts including academic papers, proposals,
professional emails, and cross-platform content generation. However, deploying
LLMs as trusted communication intermediaries raises critical questions about
information fidelity, consistency, and reliability. This position paper
systematically evaluates the trustworthiness requirements for LAAC's deployment
across multiple communication domains. We investigate three fundamental
dimensions: (1) Information Capture Fidelity - accuracy of intent extraction
during sender interviews across different communication types, (2)
Reproducibility - consistency of structured knowledge across multiple
interaction instances, and (3) Query Response Integrity - reliability of
recipient-facing responses without hallucination, source conflation, or
fabrication. Through controlled experiments spanning multiple LAAC use cases,
we assess these trust dimensions using LAAC's multi-agent architecture.
Preliminary findings reveal measurable trust gaps that must be addressed before
LAAC can be reliably deployed in high-stakes communication scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前社会科学中使用LLM模拟人类行为时，缺乏对LLM生成文本真实性的稳健评估工具，现有验证方法主要依赖不可靠的人类判断。

Method: 引入计算图灵测试框架，整合聚合指标（BERT检测性和语义相似度）与可解释语言特征（风格标记和主题模式）；系统比较9个开源LLM在5种校准策略下的表现。

Result: 即使经过校准，LLM输出仍明显可区分于人类文本；指令调优模型表现不如基础模型；模型规模扩大不增强人类相似性；存在人类相似性与语义保真度的权衡。

Conclusion: 为LLM模拟提供了可扩展的验证和校准框架，同时警示了当前LLM在捕捉人类交流方面的局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in the social sciences to
simulate human behavior, based on the assumption that they can generate
realistic, human-like text. Yet this assumption remains largely untested.
Existing validation efforts rely heavily on human-judgment-based evaluations --
testing whether humans can distinguish AI from human output -- despite evidence
that such judgments are blunt and unreliable. As a result, the field lacks
robust tools for assessing the realism of LLM-generated text or for calibrating
models to real-world data. This paper makes two contributions. First, we
introduce a computational Turing test: a validation framework that integrates
aggregate metrics (BERT-based detectability and semantic similarity) with
interpretable linguistic features (stylistic markers and topical patterns) to
assess how closely LLMs approximate human language within a given dataset.
Second, we systematically compare nine open-weight LLMs across five calibration
strategies -- including fine-tuning, stylistic prompting, and context retrieval
-- benchmarking their ability to reproduce user interactions on X (formerly
Twitter), Bluesky, and Reddit. Our findings challenge core assumptions in the
literature. Even after calibration, LLM outputs remain clearly distinguishable
from human text, particularly in affective tone and emotional expression.
Instruction-tuned models underperform their base counterparts, and scaling up
model size does not enhance human-likeness. Crucially, we identify a trade-off:
optimizing for human-likeness often comes at the cost of semantic fidelity, and
vice versa. These results provide a much-needed scalable framework for
validation and calibration in LLM simulations -- and offer a cautionary note
about their current limitations in capturing human communication.

Abstract: This study provides an empirical assessment of whether current large language
models (LLMs) can pass the official qualifying examination for membership in
Poland's National Appeal Chamber (Krajowa Izba Odwo{\l}awcza). The authors
examine two related ideas: using LLM as actual exam candidates and applying the
'LLM-as-a-judge' approach, in which model-generated answers are automatically
evaluated by other models. The paper describes the structure of the exam, which
includes a multiple-choice knowledge test on public procurement law and a
written judgment, and presents the hybrid information recovery and extraction
pipeline built to support the models. Several LLMs (including GPT-4.1, Claude 4
Sonnet and Bielik-11B-v2.6) were tested in closed-book and various
Retrieval-Augmented Generation settings. The results show that although the
models achieved satisfactory scores in the knowledge test, none met the passing
threshold in the practical written part, and the evaluations of the
'LLM-as-a-judge' often diverged from the judgments of the official examining
committee. The authors highlight key limitations: susceptibility to
hallucinations, incorrect citation of legal provisions, weaknesses in logical
argumentation, and the need for close collaboration between legal experts and
technical teams. The findings indicate that, despite rapid technological
progress, current LLMs cannot yet replace human judges or independent examiners
in Polish public procurement adjudication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的遗忘评估方法通常在单个输入层面进行评估，可能忽略语义相似示例中的残余影响，这会危及隐私并导致间接信息泄露。

Method: REMIND通过分析模型在输入微小变化时的损失模式来检测未学习数据的残余影响。未学习数据产生更平坦、不那么陡峭的损失景观，而保留或无关数据则表现出更尖锐、更易变的模式。

Result: REMIND仅需要基于查询的访问，在类似约束下优于现有方法，并在不同模型、数据集和转述输入上表现出鲁棒性，使其适用于实际部署。

Conclusion: REMIND为语言模型中的遗忘评估提供了一个更敏感和可解释的衡量标准，为记忆和遗忘提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific training data
from a model without requiring full retraining. This capability is crucial for
ensuring privacy, safety, and regulatory compliance. Therefore, verifying
whether a model has truly forgotten target data is essential for maintaining
reliability and trustworthiness. However, existing evaluation methods often
assess forgetting at the level of individual inputs. This approach may overlook
residual influence present in semantically similar examples. Such influence can
compromise privacy and lead to indirect information leakage. We propose REMIND
(Residual Memorization In Neighborhood Dynamics), a novel evaluation method
aiming to detect the subtle remaining influence of unlearned data and classify
whether the data has been effectively forgotten. REMIND analyzes the model's
loss over small input variations and reveals patterns unnoticed by single-point
evaluations. We show that unlearned data yield flatter, less steep loss
landscapes, while retained or unrelated data exhibit sharper, more volatile
patterns. REMIND requires only query-based access, outperforms existing methods
under similar constraints, and demonstrates robustness across different models,
datasets, and paraphrased inputs, making it practical for real-world
deployment. By providing a more sensitive and interpretable measure of
unlearning effectiveness, REMIND provides a reliable framework to assess
unlearning in language models. As a result, REMIND offers a novel perspective
on memorization and unlearning.

Motivation: 理解预训练装置从数据中提取知识和思想的效率，量化预训练过程遗留的数据集价值，以及这种效率如何随规模变化。

Method: 使用检索增强生成和测试时计算，在标准开源数据集上进行预训练后检索，评估MMLU、Math-500和SimpleQA等任务的表现。

Result: 检索带来MMLU、Math-500和SimpleQA的显著准确率提升，在MMLU上检索相当于预训练计算量的5倍乘数，LLaMA 3.1 8B模型在MMLU上获得10个百分点的改进。

Conclusion: 当前的预训练方法未能充分利用现有预训练数据集中的信息，仍有显著改进空间。

Abstract: Large language models learn from their vast pre-training corpora, gaining the
ability to solve an ever increasing variety of tasks; yet although researchers
work to improve these datasets, there is little effort to understand how
efficient the pre-training apparatus is at extracting ideas and knowledge from
the data. In this work, we use retrieval augmented generation along with
test-time compute as a way to quantify how much dataset value was left behind
by the process of pre-training, and how this changes across scale. We
demonstrate that pre-training then retrieving from standard and largely
open-sourced datasets results in significant accuracy gains in MMLU, Math-500,
and SimpleQA, which persist through decontamination. For MMLU we observe that
retrieval acts as a ~5x compute multiplier versus pre-training alone. We show
that these results can be further improved by leveraging additional compute at
test time to parse the retrieved context, demonstrating a 10 percentage point

TL;DR: 提出一种基于图的方法为话题建模生成的主题词分配有意义的标签，该方法在保持计算效率的同时，在BERTScore和余弦相似度方面优于传统基准方法，结果与ChatGPT-3.5相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有话题建模方法生成的主题词分布缺乏清晰的可解释性，且大多数方法计算成本高昂。本文旨在开发一种计算效率高的话题标签方法，为话题词分配有意义的标签。

Method: 采用基于图的方法，通过丰富话题词的语义相关词并分析它们之间的关系，从图中推导出合适的话题标签。

Result: 在两个不同数据集上的比较研究表明，该方法在BERTScore和余弦相似度方面持续优于传统基准方法，结果与ChatGPT-3.5相当，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: 基于图的方法为话题标签提供了一种计算效率高的解决方案，未来研究方向包括增强可解释性和自动化水平。

Abstract: Extracting topics from text has become an essential task, especially with the
rapid growth of unstructured textual data. Most existing works rely on highly
computational methods to address this challenge. In this paper, we argue that
probabilistic and statistical approaches, such as topic modeling (TM), can
offer effective alternatives that require fewer computational resources. TM is
a statistical method that automatically discovers topics in large collections
of unlabeled text; however, it produces topics as distributions of
representative words, which often lack clear interpretability. Our objective is
to perform topic labeling by assigning meaningful labels to these sets of
words. To achieve this without relying on computationally expensive models, we
propose a graph-based approach that not only enriches topic words with
semantically related terms but also explores the relationships among them. By
analyzing these connections within the graph, we derive suitable labels that
accurately capture each topic's meaning. We present a comparative study between
our proposed method and several benchmarks, including ChatGPT-3.5, across two
different datasets. Our method achieved consistently better results than
traditional benchmarks in terms of BERTScore and cosine similarity and produced
results comparable to ChatGPT-3.5, while remaining computationally efficient.
Finally, we discuss future directions for topic labeling and highlight
potential research avenues for enhancing interpretability and automation.

*Kun Yang,Zikang chen,Yanmeng Wang,Zhigen Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SSPO提出句子级重要性比率，在GRPO和GSPO之间取得平衡，避免训练崩溃和采样数据利用率低的问题，并在五个数据集上取得最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR算法如GRPO存在策略更新不稳定问题，GSPO存在采样数据利用率低的问题，需要一种平衡的解决方案。

Method: SSPO采用句子级重要性比率，并在PPO-CLIP中应用句子熵来动态调整裁剪边界。

Result: SSPO在五个数据集上平均得分46.57，超越GRPO(43.01)和GSPO(44.42)，在三个数据集上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SSPO通过采用GSPO的优点但避免其缺点，有效利用了生成数据，在推理任务中表现出色。

Abstract: As a significant part of post-training of the Large Language Models (LLMs),
Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has greatly improved LLMs'
reasoning skills. However, some RLVR algorithms, such as GRPO (Group Relative
Policy Optimization) and GSPO (Group Sequence Policy Optimization), are
observed to suffer from unstable policy updates and low usage of sampling data,
respectively. The importance ratio of GRPO is calculated at the token level,
which focuses more on optimizing a single token. This will be easily affected
by outliers, leading to model training collapse. GSPO proposed the calculation
of the response level importance ratio, which solves the problem of high
variance and training noise accumulation in the calculation of the GRPO
importance ratio. However, since all the response tokens share a common
importance ratio, extreme values can easily raise or lower the overall mean,
leading to the entire response being mistakenly discarded, resulting in a
decrease in the utilization of sampled data. This paper introduces SSPO, which
applies sentence-level importance ratio, taking the balance between GRPO and
GSPO. SSPO not only avoids training collapse and high variance, but also
prevents the whole response tokens from being abandoned by the clipping
mechanism. Furthermore, we apply sentence entropy to PPO-CLIP to steadily
adjust the clipping bounds, encouraging high-entropy tokens to explore and
narrow the clipping range of low-entropy tokens. In particular, SSPO achieves
an average score of 46.57 across five datasets, surpassing GRPO (43.01) and
GSPO (44.42), and wins state-of-the-art performance on three datasets. These
results highlight SSPO's effectiveness in leveraging generated data by taking
the essence of GSPO but rejecting its shortcomings.

*Mohammad Amin Ghanizadeh,Mohammad Javad Dousti*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于机器翻译微调的数据选择方法，通过定义可学习性分数来评估数据点的训练效用，结合批量选择策略优化训练效率，在多个语言对上实现了5倍的数据效率提升和24倍的计算效率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据质量及其有效选择是提高机器翻译模型性能的基础，对于实现稳健可靠的翻译系统至关重要。传统方法在数据选择方面存在不足，需要更系统的方法来识别对训练最有价值的数据点。

Method: 利用学习模型与预训练参考模型之间的协同作用，定义可学习性分数来系统评估数据点的训练效用，采用考虑数据点间相互依赖关系的批量选择策略来优化训练过程。

Result: 在英译波斯等多个语言对上的实验表明，该方法相比iid基线实现了5倍的数据效率提升，使用缓存嵌入时计算效率提升24倍，并获得了比随机选择方法更好的翻译性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过有效的数据选择显著提高了机器翻译系统的训练效率和性能，证明了基于可学习性分数的数据选择策略在机器翻译微调中的有效性。

Abstract: Data quality and its effective selection are fundamental to improving the
performance of machine translation models, serving as cornerstones for
achieving robust and reliable translation systems. This paper presents a data
selection methodology specifically designed for fine-tuning machine translation
systems, which leverages the synergy between a learner model and a pre-trained
reference model to enhance overall training effectiveness. By defining a
learnability score, our approach systematically evaluates the utility of data
points for training, ensuring that only the most relevant and impactful
examples contribute to the fine-tuning process. Furthermore, our method employs
a batch selection strategy which considers interdependencies among data points,
optimizing the efficiency of the training process while maintaining a focus on
data relevance. Experiments on English to Persian and several other language
pairs using an mBART model fine-tuned on the CCMatrix dataset demonstrate that
our method can achieve up to a fivefold improvement in data efficiency compared
to an iid baseline. Experimental results indicate that our approach improves
computational efficiency by 24 when utilizing cached embeddings, as it requires
fewer training data points. Additionally, it enhances generalization, resulting
in superior translation performance compared to random selection method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在时间推理任务上的表现，特别是当要求模型以特定历史时间点的视角回答问题时，以及不同语言提示对结果的影响。

Method: 使用1940年挪威书籍中的知识问答，分别用英语和挪威语提示LLMs回答问题，采用LLM-as-judge方法评分，并由母语者抽样检查。测试了DeepSeek-R1、Gemma3、Qwen3、Llama3.1等模型家族以及专门为挪威语设计的最大LLM。

Result: 英语提示始终比挪威语提示效果更好，这是一个意外结果。使用更大的LLMs能改善结果。

Conclusion: LLMs在时间推理任务上表现存在语言差异，英语提示优于挪威语提示，模型规模对性能有积极影响。

Abstract: In this study, we experiment with the ability of LLMs to do temporal
reasoning. Using a Norwegian book from 1940 containing trivia questions, we
prompt the LLMs to answer the questions as if it were 1940. We also pose the
questions in both English and Norwegian. Correct answers are often presented as
sentences, and grading is done by means of LLM-as-judge, with sampled checks by
a native speaker. Prompting in English consistently gave better results than in
Norwegian, an unexpected result. In contrast, using larger LLMs improved
results. We tested the DeepSeek-R1, Gemma3, Qwen3, and Llama3.1 model families,
and also the largest available LLM especially crafted for Norwegian.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有抑郁症严重程度预测模型缺乏不确定性估计和时间建模能力，而准确的、可解释的预测对临床决策支持至关重要。

Method: 提出PTTSD框架，包含序列到序列和序列到单值两种变体，结合双向LSTM、自注意力机制、残差连接，使用高斯或Student-t输出头并通过负对数似然训练。

Result: 在E-DAIC和DAIC-WOZ数据集上，PTTSD在纯文本系统中达到最优性能（E-DAIC上MAE=3.85，DAIC上MAE=3.55），并产生良好校准的预测区间。

Conclusion: 注意力机制和概率建模具有重要价值，不确定性感知预测具有临床相关性和可解释性，为抑郁症检测提供了可靠框架。

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable predictions of depression severity are essential
for clinical decision support, yet existing models often lack uncertainty
estimates and temporal modeling. We propose PTTSD, a Probabilistic Textual Time
Series Depression Detection framework that predicts PHQ-8 scores from
utterance-level clinical interviews while modeling uncertainty over time. PTTSD
includes sequence-to-sequence and sequence-to-one variants, both combining
bidirectional LSTMs, self-attention, and residual connections with Gaussian or
Student-t output heads trained via negative log-likelihood. Evaluated on E-DAIC
and DAIC-WOZ, PTTSD achieves state-of-the-art performance among text-only
systems (e.g., MAE = 3.85 on E-DAIC, 3.55 on DAIC) and produces well-calibrated
prediction intervals. Ablations confirm the value of attention and
probabilistic modeling, while comparisons with MentalBERT establish generality.
A three-part calibration analysis and qualitative case studies further
highlight the interpretability and clinical relevance of uncertainty-aware
forecasting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态基准主要关注高资源语言，泰语在需要文档结构理解的任务中代表性不足，因此需要专门的基准来填补这一空白。

Method: 创建了多样化、人工标注的数据集，在零样本设置下评估了广泛的专有和开源视觉语言模型。

Result: 专有模型（如Gemini 2.5 Pro）表现优于开源模型，细粒度文本识别和手写内容提取是开源模型表现最差的任务。

Conclusion: ThaiOCRBench为评估低资源、复杂脚本环境下的视觉语言模型提供了标准化框架，并为改进泰语文档理解提供了可行见解。

Abstract: We present ThaiOCRBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
vision-language models (VLMs) on Thai text-rich visual understanding tasks.
Despite recent progress in multimodal modeling, existing benchmarks
predominantly focus on high-resource languages, leaving Thai underrepresented,
especially in tasks requiring document structure understanding. ThaiOCRBench
addresses this gap by offering a diverse, human-annotated dataset comprising
2,808 samples across 13 task categories. We evaluate a wide range of
state-of-the-art VLMs in a zero-shot setting, spanning both proprietary and
open-source systems. Results show a significant performance gap, with
proprietary models (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro) outperforming open-source
counterparts. Notably, fine-grained text recognition and handwritten content
extraction exhibit the steepest performance drops among open-source models.
Through detailed error analysis, we identify key challenges such as language
bias, structural mismatch, and hallucinated content. ThaiOCRBench provides a
standardized framework for assessing VLMs in low-resource, script-complex
settings, and provides actionable insights for improving Thai-language document
understanding.

TL;DR: RUST-BENCH是一个新的表格推理基准测试，包含7966个问题，来自2031个真实世界表格，涵盖科学和体育两个领域，旨在评估LLM在复杂表格数据上的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表格推理基准测试主要使用小型、统一的表格，无法反映真实世界数据的复杂性，导致对大型语言模型推理能力的评估不完整。真实表格通常很长、异构且领域特定，需要跨数千个标记的多跳推理。

Method: 引入RUST-BENCH基准测试，包含7966个问题，来自2031个真实世界表格，涵盖两个领域：RB-Science（NSF资助记录）和RB-Sports（NBA统计数据）。该基准测试联合评估LLM在规模、异构性、领域特异性和推理复杂性方面的表现。

Result: 实验表明，开源和专有LLM在处理异构模式和复杂多跳推理方面都存在困难，揭示了当前架构和提示策略的持续弱点。

Conclusion: RUST-BENCH为推进表格推理研究建立了一个具有挑战性的新测试平台，突出了当前LLM在真实世界复杂表格推理方面的局限性。

Abstract: Existing tabular reasoning benchmarks mostly test models on small, uniform
tables, underrepresenting the complexity of real-world data and giving an
incomplete view of Large Language Models' (LLMs) reasoning abilities. Real
tables are long, heterogeneous, and domain-specific, mixing structured fields
with free text and requiring multi-hop reasoning across thousands of tokens. To
address this gap, we introduce RUST-BENCH, a benchmark of 7966 questions from
2031 real-world tables spanning two domains: i) RB-Science (NSF grant records)
and ii) RB-Sports (NBA statistics). Unlike prior work, RUST-BENCH evaluates
LLMs jointly across scale, heterogeneity, domain specificity, and reasoning
complexity. Experiments with open-source and proprietary models show that LLMs
struggle with heterogeneous schemas and complex multi-hop inference, revealing
persistent weaknesses in current architectures and prompting strategies.
RUST-BENCH establishes a challenging new testbed for advancing tabular
reasoning research.

Motivation: 研究发现文本简化性能与源文本和目标文本的CEFR级别差距高度相关，这启发了多轮简化方法的设计。

Method: 提出了两种基于GPT-4o的多轮简化方法：规则式多轮简化(MRS-Rule)和联合规则式LLM多轮简化(MRS-Joint)。

Result: 提交的系统在20个团队中排名第7，后续改进显示将LLM简化结果作为起点可以进一步提升多轮简化性能。

Conclusion: 多轮简化方法有效，特别是将LLM简化候选作为起点能显著提升性能，证明了源目标文本级别差距对简化效果的重要性。

Abstract: This paper describes the OUNLP system submitted to the TSAR-2025 Shared Task
(Alva-Manchego et al., 2025), designed for readability-controlled text
simplification using LLM-prompting-based generation. Based on the analysis of
prompt-based text simplification methods, we discovered an interesting finding
that text simplification performance is highly related to the gap between the
source CEFR (Arase et al., 2022) level and the target CEFR level. Inspired by
this finding, we propose two multi-round simplification methods and generate
them via GPT-4o: rule-based simplification (MRS-Rule) and jointly rule-based
LLM simplification (MRS-Joint). Our submitted systems ranked 7 out of 20 teams.
Later improvements with MRS-Joint show that taking the LLM simplified
candidates as the starting point could further boost the multi-round
simplification performance.

Motivation: 随着LLMs在人类中心应用中的普及，理解其类似人格的行为对于负责任开发和部署至关重要。

Method: 应用BFI-2人格框架评估6个LLMs，在不同采样温度下分析人格特质表达，使用层次聚类识别模型分组。

Result: 发现四个主要人格维度存在显著差异，神经质和外向性对温度调整敏感，模型架构特征导致特定模型具有稳定的人格特征。

Conclusion: 研究为LLMs中类似人格模式的涌现提供了新见解，为模型调优、选择和AI系统伦理治理提供了新视角。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral to human-centered
applications, understanding their personality-like behaviors is increasingly
important for responsible development and deployment. This paper systematically
evaluates six LLMs, applying the Big Five Inventory-2 (BFI-2) framework, to
assess trait expressions under varying sampling temperatures. We find
significant differences across four of the five personality dimensions, with
Neuroticism and Extraversion susceptible to temperature adjustments. Further,
hierarchical clustering reveals distinct model clusters, suggesting that
architectural features may predispose certain models toward stable trait
profiles. Taken together, these results offer new insights into the emergence
of personality-like patterns in LLMs and provide a new perspective on model
tuning, selection, and the ethical governance of AI systems. We share the data

Motivation: 现有RAG评估框架在专业安全关键领域存在不足，基于启发式的指标无法捕捉领域特定细微差别，LLM-as-a-Judge方法缺乏与人类判断的有效对齐验证。

Method: RAGalyst采用代理流水线从源文档生成高质量合成QA数据集，包含代理过滤步骤确保数据保真度。通过提示优化精炼两个关键LLM-as-a-Judge指标（答案正确性和可回答性），实现与人类标注的强相关性。

Result: 在三个不同领域（军事行动、网络安全、桥梁工程）评估各种RAG组件，发现性能高度依赖上下文，没有单一的嵌入模型、LLM或超参数配置是普遍最优的。分析了RAG中低答案正确性的最常见原因。

Conclusion: RAGalyst系统化评估框架的必要性得到验证，它使从业者能够发现领域特定的权衡，并为构建可靠有效的RAG系统做出明智的设计选择。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a critical technique for grounding
Large Language Models (LLMs) in factual evidence, yet evaluating RAG systems in
specialized, safety-critical domains remains a significant challenge. Existing
evaluation frameworks often rely on heuristic-based metrics that fail to
capture domain-specific nuances and other works utilize LLM-as-a-Judge
approaches that lack validated alignment with human judgment. This paper
introduces RAGalyst, an automated, human-aligned agentic framework designed for
the rigorous evaluation of domain-specific RAG systems. RAGalyst features an
agentic pipeline that generates high-quality, synthetic question-answering (QA)
datasets from source documents, incorporating an agentic filtering step to
ensure data fidelity. The framework refines two key LLM-as-a-Judge
metrics-Answer Correctness and Answerability-using prompt optimization to
achieve a strong correlation with human annotations. Applying this framework to
evaluate various RAG components across three distinct domains (military
operations, cybersecurity, and bridge engineering), we find that performance is
highly context-dependent. No single embedding model, LLM, or hyperparameter
configuration proves universally optimal. Additionally, we provide an analysis
on the most common low Answer Correctness reasons in RAG. These findings
highlight the necessity of a systematic evaluation framework like RAGalyst,
which empowers practitioners to uncover domain-specific trade-offs and make
informed design choices for building reliable and effective RAG systems.
RAGalyst is available on our Github.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射学报告对临床决策至关重要，但包含两种不确定性：显性不确定性（通过模棱两可的短语表达）和隐性不确定性（由于省略推理部分导致），需要系统方法来量化这些不确定性以支持自动化分析。

Method: 1. 量化显性不确定性：创建专家验证的LLM参考排名，将常见模棱两可短语映射到概率值；2. 建模隐性不确定性：通过扩展框架系统添加从专家定义诊断路径中推导的特征性子发现。

Result: 发布了Lunguage++，这是Lunguage基准的扩展、不确定性感知版本，包含细粒度结构化放射学报告，支持不确定性感知图像分类、忠实诊断推理和临床影响研究。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了放射学报告中的两种不确定性类型，为不确定性感知的医学图像分析和诊断推理提供了有价值的资源，推动了临床诊断不确定性的研究。

Abstract: Radiology reports are invaluable for clinical decision-making and hold great
potential for automated analysis when structured into machine-readable formats.
These reports often contain uncertainty, which we categorize into two distinct
types: (i) Explicit uncertainty reflects doubt about the presence or absence of
findings, conveyed through hedging phrases. These vary in meaning depending on
the context, making rule-based systems insufficient to quantify the level of
uncertainty for specific findings; (ii) Implicit uncertainty arises when
radiologists omit parts of their reasoning, recording only key findings or
diagnoses. Here, it is often unclear whether omitted findings are truly absent
or simply unmentioned for brevity. We address these challenges with a two-part
framework. We quantify explicit uncertainty by creating an expert-validated,
LLM-based reference ranking of common hedging phrases, and mapping each finding
to a probability value based on this reference. In addition, we model implicit
uncertainty through an expansion framework that systematically adds
characteristic sub-findings derived from expert-defined diagnostic pathways for
14 common diagnoses. Using these methods, we release Lunguage++, an expanded,
uncertainty-aware version of the Lunguage benchmark of fine-grained structured
radiology reports. This enriched resource enables uncertainty-aware image
classification, faithful diagnostic reasoning, and new investigations into the
clinical impact of diagnostic uncertainty.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过控制语言模型的隐藏激活来预测和干预其不确定性，发现在推理过程中模型隐含地表示可能的推理路径空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在生成文本时，单个token的选择可能导致完全不同的推理路径，这使得不确定性难以量化。研究旨在探索语言模型是否表示它们可能采取的替代路径。

Method: 使用隐藏激活来控制并预测语言模型在思维链推理过程中的不确定性，通过激活干预来测试模型的可操控性。

Result: 发现模型在不同token上的不确定性与通过控制激活来引导模型的容易程度存在明显相关性；隐藏激活可以预测模型的未来结果分布。

Conclusion: 激活干预在模型尚未承诺特定最终答案时最有效，表明模型隐含地表示可能的路径空间。

Abstract: When a language model generates text, the selection of individual tokens
might lead it down very different reasoning paths, making uncertainty difficult
to quantify. In this work, we consider whether reasoning language models
represent the alternate paths that they could take during generation. To test
this hypothesis, we use hidden activations to control and predict a language
model's uncertainty during chain-of-thought reasoning. In our experiments, we
find a clear correlation between how uncertain a model is at different tokens,
and how easily the model can be steered by controlling its activations. This
suggests that activation interventions are most effective when there are
alternate paths available to the model -- in other words, when it has not yet
committed to a particular final answer. We also find that hidden activations
can predict a model's future outcome distribution, demonstrating that models
implicitly represent the space of possible paths.

Abstract: We present IntelliProof, an interactive system for analyzing argumentative
essays through LLMs. IntelliProof structures an essay as an argumentation
graph, where claims are represented as nodes, supporting evidence is attached
as node properties, and edges encode supporting or attacking relations. Unlike
existing automated essay scoring systems, IntelliProof emphasizes the user
experience: each relation is initially classified and scored by an LLM, then
visualized for enhanced understanding. The system provides justifications for
classifications and produces quantitative measures for essay coherence. It
enables rapid exploration of argumentative quality while retaining human
oversight. In addition, IntelliProof provides a set of tools for a better
understanding of an argumentative essay and its corresponding graph in natural
language, bridging the gap between the structural semantics of argumentative
essays and the user's understanding of a given text. A live demo and the system

Abstract: As the role of Large Language Models (LLM)-based coding assistants in
software development becomes more critical, so does the role of the bugs they
generate in the overall cybersecurity landscape. While a number of LLM code
security benchmarks have been proposed alongside approaches to improve the
security of generated code, it remains unclear to what extent they have
impacted widely used coding LLMs. Here, we show that even the latest
open-weight models are vulnerable in the earliest reported vulnerability
scenarios in a realistic use setting, suggesting that the safety-functionality
trade-off has until now prevented effective patching of vulnerabilities. To
help address this issue, we introduce a new severity metric that reflects the
risk posed by an LLM-generated vulnerability, accounting for vulnerability
severity, generation chance, and the formulation of the prompt that induces
vulnerable code generation - Prompt Exposure (PE). To encourage the mitigation
of the most serious and prevalent vulnerabilities, we use PE to define the
Model Exposure (ME) score, which indicates the severity and prevalence of
vulnerabilities a model generates.

Abstract: Developing accurate biomedical Question Answering (QA) systems in
low-resource languages remains a major challenge, limiting equitable access to
reliable medical knowledge. This paper introduces BanglaMedQA and
BanglaMMedBench, the first large-scale Bangla biomedical Multiple Choice
Question (MCQ) datasets designed to evaluate reasoning and retrieval in medical
artificial intelligence (AI). The study applies and benchmarks several
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) strategies, including Traditional,
Zero-Shot Fallback, Agentic, Iterative Feedback, and Aggregate RAG, combining
textbook-based and web retrieval with generative reasoning to improve factual
accuracy. A key novelty lies in integrating a Bangla medical textbook corpus
through Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and implementing an Agentic RAG
pipeline that dynamically selects between retrieval and reasoning strategies.
Experimental results show that the Agentic RAG achieved the highest accuracy
89.54% with openai/gpt-oss-120b, outperforming other configurations and
demonstrating superior rationale quality. These findings highlight the
potential of RAG-based methods to enhance the reliability and accessibility of
Bangla medical QA, establishing a foundation for future research in
multilingual medical artificial intelligence.

TL;DR: DeReC是一个轻量级事实核查框架，使用通用文本嵌入替代自回归LLM，在保持高准确率的同时显著提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的事实核查系统存在计算成本高和幻觉风险的问题，需要更高效实用的解决方案。

Method: 结合密集检索和专门分类的方法，用文本嵌入替代LLM生成解释性推理。

Result: 在RAWFC数据集上F1得分65.58%，超越L-Defense(61.20%)；运行时间减少95%(RAWFC)和92%(LIAR-RAW)。

Conclusion: 精心设计的基于检索的系统可以在专业任务中匹配或超越LLM性能，同时更适合实际部署。

Abstract: The proliferation of misinformation necessitates robust yet computationally
efficient fact verification systems. While current state-of-the-art approaches
leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating explanatory rationales,
these methods face significant computational barriers and hallucination risks
in real-world deployments. We present DeReC (Dense Retrieval Classification), a
lightweight framework that demonstrates how general-purpose text embeddings can
effectively replace autoregressive LLM-based approaches in fact verification
tasks. By combining dense retrieval with specialized classification, our system
achieves better accuracy while being significantly more efficient. DeReC
outperforms explanation-generating LLMs in efficiency, reducing runtime by 95%
on RAWFC (23 minutes 36 seconds compared to 454 minutes 12 seconds) and by 92%
on LIAR-RAW (134 minutes 14 seconds compared to 1692 minutes 23 seconds),
showcasing its effectiveness across varying dataset sizes. On the RAWFC
dataset, DeReC achieves an F1 score of 65.58%, surpassing the state-of-the-art
method L-Defense (61.20%). Our results demonstrate that carefully engineered
retrieval-based systems can match or exceed LLM performance in specialized
tasks while being significantly more practical for real-world deployment.

TL;DR: LEASH是一种无需训练的解码算法，通过监控token级熵的斜率和top-logit边界的改进来自适应停止推理生成，在保持准确性的同时显著减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) 提示技术虽然能实现复杂推理，但生成完整固定长度的推理过程计算效率低下，增加了token使用量和延迟。

Method: LEASH监控两个内在信号：token级熵的斜率和top-logit边界的改进，当两个信号都达到平台期时停止生成，表明模型已达到稳定的推理状态。

Result: 在四个指令调优模型上，GSM8K和AQuA-RAT基准测试显示，LEASH平均减少30-35%的token生成和27%的延迟，相对CoT仅产生10个百分点的准确率下降。

Conclusion: LEASH是模型无关的，无需额外训练或监督，为CoT解码提供了一个简单高效的替代方案。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is a key technique for enabling complex
reasoning in large language models. However, generating full, fixed-length
rationales is computationally wasteful, inflating both token usage and latency.
We introduce LEASH: Logit-Entropy Adaptive Stopping Heuristic, a training-free
decoding algorithm that adaptively halts rationale generation. LEASH monitors
two intrinsic signals: the slope of token-level entropy and the improvement in
the top-logit margin. It terminates the generation once both signals plateau,
indicating the model has reached a stable reasoning state. Across four
instruction-tuned models on the GSM8K and AQuA-RAT benchmarks, LEASH reduces
average token generation by 30--35% and latency by 27%, while incurring a 10
p.p. accuracy drop relative to CoT. LEASH is model-agnostic and requires no
additional training or supervision, offering a simple and efficient alternative
to CoT decoding.

Abstract: This study presents a federated learning (FL) framework for
privacy-preserving electrocardiogram (ECG) classification in Internet of Things
(IoT) healthcare environments. By transforming 1D ECG signals into 2D Gramian
Angular Field (GAF) images, the proposed approach enables efficient feature
extraction through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) while ensuring that
sensitive medical data remain local to each device. This work is among the
first to experimentally validate GAF-based federated ECG classification across
heterogeneous IoT devices, quantifying both performance and communication
efficiency. To evaluate feasibility in realistic IoT settings, we deployed the
framework across a server, a laptop, and a resource-constrained Raspberry Pi 4,
reflecting edge-cloud integration in IoT ecosystems. Experimental results
demonstrate that the FL-GAF model achieves a high classification accuracy of
95.18% in a multi-client setup, significantly outperforming a single-client
baseline in both accuracy and training time. Despite the added computational
complexity of GAF transformations, the framework maintains efficient resource
utilization and communication overhead. These findings highlight the potential
of lightweight, privacy-preserving AI for IoT-based healthcare monitoring,
supporting scalable and secure edge deployments in smart health systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 短视频平台中，评论在促进社区参与和内容再创作方面起着重要作用，但生成既符合平台规范又具有风格多样性和上下文感知的评论仍然是一个重大挑战。

Method: 采用模块化多智能体系统，集成视频分割、上下文和情感分析、风格感知提示构建，支持六种评论风格，使用多模态大语言模型直接处理视频输入。

Result: 在抖音和YouTube上分别获得超过90%和87.55%的用户偏好率，显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 该工作为短视频平台上的风格化评论生成提供了一个可扩展和文化适应的框架，为增强用户参与度和创造性互动提供了有前景的路径。

Abstract: Short-video platforms have become a central medium in the modern Internet
landscape, where efficient information delivery and strong interactivity are
reshaping user engagement and cultural dissemination. Among the various forms
of user interaction, comments play a vital role in fostering community
participation and enabling content re-creation. However, generating comments
that are both compliant with platform guidelines and capable of exhibiting
stylistic diversity and contextual awareness remains a significant challenge.
We introduce LOLGORITHM, a modular multi-agent system (MAS) designed for
controllable short-video comment generation. The system integrates video
segmentation, contextual and affective analysis, and style-aware prompt
construction. It supports six distinct comment styles: puns (homophones),
rhyming, meme application, sarcasm (irony), plain humor, and content
extraction. Powered by a multimodal large language model (MLLM), LOLGORITHM
directly processes video inputs and achieves fine-grained style control through
explicit prompt markers and few-shot examples. To support development and
evaluation, we construct a bilingual dataset using official APIs from Douyin
(Chinese) and YouTube (English), covering five popular video genres: comedy
skits, daily life jokes, funny animal clips, humorous commentary, and talk
shows. Evaluation combines automated metrics originality, relevance, and style
conformity with a large-scale human preference study involving 40 videos and
105 participants. Results show that LOLGORITHM significantly outperforms
baseline models, achieving preference rates of over 90% on Douyin and 87.55% on
YouTube. This work presents a scalable and culturally adaptive framework for
stylized comment generation on short-video platforms, offering a promising path
to enhance user engagement and creative interaction.

TL;DR: 构建了Common-O基准测试来评估多模态语言模型在真实场景中的推理能力，发现即使最好的模型在跨场景推理时表现也很差，存在严重幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在感知基准测试上表现良好但趋于饱和，但在真实世界推理时仍存在严重幻觉问题，需要新的基准测试来评估跨场景推理能力。

Method: 构建包含10.5k个新图像的Common-O基准测试，基于人类认知测试设计"共同点"推理任务，评估领先的多模态语言模型。

Result: 最佳模型在Common-O上仅达到35%准确率，在更复杂的Common-O Complex上仅1%；模型在场景中存在相似物体时更容易产生幻觉。

Conclusion: 跨场景推理对现有模型极具挑战性，多图像训练可能提供改进方向，发布基准测试以推动解决跨场景推理中的幻觉问题。

Abstract: Multimodal language models possess a remarkable ability to handle an
open-vocabulary's worth of objects. Yet the best models still suffer from
hallucinations when reasoning about scenes in the real world, revealing a gap
between their seemingly strong performance on existing perception benchmarks
that are saturating and their reasoning in the real world. To address this gap,
we build a novel benchmark of in-the-wild scenes that we call Common-O. With
more than 10.5k examples using exclusively new images not found in web training
data to avoid contamination, Common-O goes beyond just perception, inspired by
cognitive tests for humans, to probe reasoning across scenes by asking "what's
in common?". We evaluate leading multimodal language models, including models
specifically trained to perform chain-of-thought reasoning. We find that
perceiving objects in single images is tractable for most models, yet reasoning
across scenes is very challenging even for the best models, including reasoning
models. Despite saturating many leaderboards focusing on perception, the best
performing model only achieves 35% on Common-O -- and on Common-O Complex,
consisting of more complex scenes, the best model achieves only 1%. Curiously,
we find models are more prone to hallucinate when similar objects are present
in the scene, suggesting models may be relying on object co-occurrence seen
during training. Among the models we evaluated, we found scale can provide
modest improvements while models explicitly trained with multi-image inputs
show bigger improvements, suggesting scaled multi-image training may offer
promise. We make our benchmark publicly available to spur research into the
challenge of hallucination when reasoning across scenes.

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于多模态语义扰动的新方法，用于检测视觉语言模型中的测试集污染问题，该方法在多种现实污染策略下都表现出鲁棒性和有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型使用互联网规模的预训练语料库，存在测试集泄露导致性能虚高的问题，但针对污染模型的检测方法研究不足。

Method: 通过故意污染开源视觉语言模型，并开发基于多模态语义扰动的检测方法，利用污染模型在受控扰动下无法泛化的特性进行检测。

Result: 实验表明现有检测方法要么完全失败，要么表现不一致，而提出的新方法在多种现实污染策略下都能有效检测污染模型。

Conclusion: 提出的多模态语义扰动检测方法能够可靠地识别视觉语言模型中的测试集污染问题，为模型评估提供了有效的检测工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved
state-of-the-art performance on numerous benchmark tasks. However, the use of
internet-scale, often proprietary, pretraining corpora raises a critical
concern for both practitioners and users: inflated performance due to test-set
leakage. While prior works have proposed mitigation strategies such as
decontamination of pretraining data and benchmark redesign for LLMs, the
complementary direction of developing detection methods for contaminated VLMs
remains underexplored. To address this gap, we deliberately contaminate
open-source VLMs on popular benchmarks and show that existing detection
approaches either fail outright or exhibit inconsistent behavior. We then
propose a novel simple yet effective detection method based on multi-modal
semantic perturbation, demonstrating that contaminated models fail to
generalize under controlled perturbations. Finally, we validate our approach
across multiple realistic contamination strategies, confirming its robustness
and effectiveness. The code and perturbed dataset will be released publicly.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FusionDP是一个特征级差分隐私框架，通过利用基础模型来估算敏感特征，从而在保护隐私的同时提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DP-SGD对所有特征施加隐私保护，导致过度噪声注入和效用下降。现实中，只有部分特征（如人口统计属性）需要隐私保护，而其他特征（如实验室结果）敏感性较低。

Method: 1. 使用大型基础模型根据非敏感特征估算敏感特征，作为外部先验；2. 改进的DP-SGD算法，在原始特征和估算特征上训练模型，同时正式保护原始敏感特征的隐私。

Result: 在PhysioNet败血症预测和MIMIC-III临床笔记分类任务上，FusionDP相比隐私保护基线显著提升了模型性能，同时保持了严格的特征级隐私。

Conclusion: FusionDP展示了基础模型驱动的估算在提升多种模态数据的隐私-效用权衡方面的潜力。

Abstract: Ensuring the privacy of sensitive training data is crucial in
privacy-preserving machine learning. However, in practical scenarios, privacy
protection may be required for only a subset of features. For instance, in ICU
data, demographic attributes like age and gender pose higher privacy risks due
to their re-identification potential, whereas raw lab results are generally
less sensitive. Traditional DP-SGD enforces privacy protection on all features
in one sample, leading to excessive noise injection and significant utility
degradation. We propose FusionDP, a two-step framework that enhances model
utility under feature-level differential privacy. First, FusionDP leverages
large foundation models to impute sensitive features given non-sensitive
features, treating them as external priors that provide high-quality estimates
of sensitive attributes without accessing the true values during model
training. Second, we introduce a modified DP-SGD algorithm that trains models
on both original and imputed features while formally preserving the privacy of
the original sensitive features. We evaluate FusionDP on two modalities: a
sepsis prediction task on tabular data from PhysioNet and a clinical note
classification task from MIMIC-III. By comparing against privacy-preserving
baselines, our results show that FusionDP significantly improves model
performance while maintaining rigorous feature-level privacy, demonstrating the
potential of foundation model-driven imputation to enhance the privacy-utility
trade-off for various modalities.

TL;DR: 开发自适应解释框架，通过重新加权、重新基准化和在线校准等方法，在动态变化的信用评分模型中提高解释的稳定性和公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统可解释性技术如SHAP假设数据静态分布，在概念漂移发生时其解释不稳定且可能不公平，需要开发能够适应数据分布变化的解释方法。

Method: 集成XGBoost预测建模与三种自适应SHAP变体：特征分布漂移的切片重新加权、滑动窗口背景样本的漂移感知重新基准化、增量岭回归的在线代理校准。

Result: 自适应方法特别是重新基准化和基于代理的解释显著提高了时间稳定性，减少了不同人口群体间的差异影响，且不降低预测准确性。

Conclusion: 自适应可解释性是维持数据驱动信用系统透明度、问责制和伦理可靠性的实用机制，适用于任何决策模型随人口变化而演变的领域。

Abstract: Evolving borrower behaviors, shifting economic conditions, and changing
regulatory landscapes continuously reshape the data distributions underlying
modern credit-scoring systems. Conventional explainability techniques, such as
SHAP, assume static data and fixed background distributions, making their
explanations unstable and potentially unfair when concept drift occurs. This
study addresses that challenge by developing adaptive explanation frameworks
that recalibrate interpretability and fairness in dynamically evolving credit
models. Using a multi-year credit dataset, we integrate predictive modeling via
XGBoost with three adaptive SHAP variants: (A) per-slice explanation
reweighting that adjusts for feature distribution shifts, (B) drift-aware SHAP
rebaselining with sliding-window background samples, and (C) online surrogate
calibration using incremental Ridge regression. Each method is benchmarked
against static SHAP explanations using metrics of predictive performance (AUC,
F1), directional and rank stability (cosine, Kendall tau), and fairness
(demographic parity and recalibration). Results show that adaptive methods,
particularly rebaselined and surrogate-based explanations, substantially
improve temporal stability and reduce disparate impact across demographic
groups without degrading predictive accuracy. Robustness tests, including
counterfactual perturbations, background sensitivity analysis, and
proxy-variable detection, confirm the resilience of adaptive explanations under
real-world drift conditions. These findings establish adaptive explainability
as a practical mechanism for sustaining transparency, accountability, and
ethical reliability in data-driven credit systems, and more broadly, in any
domain where decision models evolve with population change.

Motivation: 推理语言模型在复杂任务上表现良好，但由于模型规模和长推理轨迹导致部署成本高昂

Method: 使用s1.1-32B的中间表示训练轻量级预测器，预测问题难度或模型正确性，指导在推理模型池中进行路由分配

Result: 在多样化数学基准测试中，路由方法相比随机分配提高了效率，匹配s1.1-32B的性能同时显著减少计算量

Conclusion: 难度感知路由对于推理模型的成本高效部署是有效的

Abstract: Reasoning language models perform well on complex tasks but are costly to
deploy due to their size and long reasoning traces. We propose a routing
approach that assigns each problem to the smallest model likely to solve it,
reducing compute without sacrificing accuracy. Using intermediate
representations from s1.1-32B, we train lightweight predictors of problem
difficulty or model correctness to guide routing across a pool of reasoning
models. On diverse math benchmarks, routing improves efficiency over random
assignment and matches s1.1-32B's performance while using significantly less
compute. Our results demonstrate that difficulty-aware routing is effective for
cost-efficient deployment of reasoning models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自适应批量大小方法对所有架构采用相同策略，假设一刀切解决方案。本研究挑战这种假设，证明架构对自适应效果有根本性影响。

Method: 引入DEBA自适应批量调度器，监测梯度方差、梯度范数变化和损失变化。在6种架构上系统评估，使用梯度稳定性指标预测哪些架构会受益。

Result: 轻量级架构获得45-62%训练加速和1-7%精度提升；浅层残差网络精度提升2.4-4.0%，加速36-43%；深层残差网络表现高方差；ViT-B16仅6%加速。滑动窗口统计和充分冷却期是关键设计选择。

Conclusion: 自适应批量大小方法不能跨架构通用，需要架构感知设计。梯度稳定性指标可预测哪些架构会从自适应调度中受益。

Abstract: Adaptive batch size methods aim to accelerate neural network training, but
existing approaches apply identical adaptation strategies across all
architectures, assuming a one-size-fits-all solution. We introduce DEBA
(Dynamic Efficient Batch Adaptation), an adaptive batch scheduler that monitors
gradient variance, gradient norm variation and loss variation to guide batch
size adaptations. Through systematic evaluation across six architectures
(ResNet-18/50, DenseNet-121, EfficientNet-B0, MobileNet-V3, ViT-B16) on
CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, with five random seeds per configuration, we
demonstrate that the architecture fundamentally determines adaptation efficacy.
Our findings reveal that: (1) lightweight and medium-depth architectures
(MobileNet-V3, DenseNet-121, EfficientNet-B0) achieve a 45-62% training speedup
with simultaneous accuracy improvements of 1-7%; (2) shallow residual networks
(ResNet-18) show consistent gains of +2.4 - 4.0% in accuracy, 36 - 43% in
speedup, while deep residual networks (ResNet-50) exhibit high variance and
occasional degradation; (3) already-stable architectures (ViT-B16) show minimal
speedup (6%) despite maintaining accuracy, indicating that adaptation benefits
vary with baseline optimization characteristics. We introduce a baseline
characterization framework using gradient stability metrics (stability score,
gradient norm variation) that predicts which architectures will benefit from
adaptive scheduling. Our ablation studies reveal critical design choices often
overlooked in prior work: sliding window statistics (vs. full history) and
sufficient cooldown periods (5+ epochs) between adaptations are essential for
success. This work challenges the prevailing assumption that adaptive methods
generalize across architectures and provides the first systematic evidence that
batch size adaptation requires an architecture-aware design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN通过局部消息传递聚合邻居信息，虽然具有强大的归纳偏置并能利用图稀疏性，但也面临三个关键挑战：(i)长距离信息压缩，(ii)节点表示过度平滑，(iii)表达能力有限。

Method: 向标准GNN注入随机化的全局节点特征嵌入（称为Sketched Random Features），这些嵌入具有唯一性、距离敏感性和拓扑无关性，能够有效捕捉长距离依赖关系。

Result: 在真实世界图学习任务上的实验结果表明，该方法相比基线GNN持续提升性能，既可以作为独立解决方案，也可以作为现有技术（如图位置编码）的补充增强。

Conclusion: Sketched Random Features方法能够有效缓解GNN的局限性，提高模型性能，且具有计算效率高的特点。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks learn on graph-structured data by iteratively
aggregating local neighborhood information. While this local message passing
paradigm imparts a powerful inductive bias and exploits graph sparsity, it also
yields three key challenges: (i) oversquashing of long-range information, (ii)
oversmoothing of node representations, and (iii) limited expressive power. In
this work we inject randomized global embeddings of node features, which we
term \textit{Sketched Random Features}, into standard GNNs, enabling them to
efficiently capture long-range dependencies. The embeddings are unique,
distance-sensitive, and topology-agnostic -- properties which we analytically
and empirically show alleviate the aforementioned limitations when injected
into GNNs. Experimental results on real-world graph learning tasks confirm that
this strategy consistently improves performance over baseline GNNs, offering
both a standalone solution and a complementary enhancement to existing
techniques such as graph positional encodings. Our source code is available at

Abstract: Transitioning from offline to online reinforcement learning (RL) poses
critical challenges due to distributional shifts between the fixed behavior
policy in the offline dataset and the evolving policy during online learning.
Although this issue is widely recognized, few methods attempt to explicitly
assess or utilize the distributional structure of the offline data itself,
leaving a research gap in adapting learning strategies to different types of
samples. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative method,
Energy-Guided Diffusion Stratification (StratDiff), which facilitates smoother
transitions in offline-to-online RL. StratDiff deploys a diffusion model to
learn prior knowledge from the offline dataset. It then refines this knowledge
through energy-based functions to improve policy imitation and generate
offline-like actions during online fine-tuning. The KL divergence between the
generated action and the corresponding sampled action is computed for each
sample and used to stratify the training batch into offline-like and
online-like subsets. Offline-like samples are updated using offline objectives,
while online-like samples follow online learning strategies. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of StratDiff by integrating it with off-the-shelf methods Cal-QL
and IQL. Extensive empirical evaluations on D4RL benchmarks show that StratDiff
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving enhanced adaptability and
more stable performance across diverse RL settings.

TL;DR: 本文扩展了因果加性模型(CAM)以处理高阶交互作用，引入了有向无环超图来表示这种结构，提供了可识别性结果，并开发了相应的学习算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的许多过程都表现出高阶机制，但在因果发现中对交互作用的显式处理却很少受到关注。

Method: 扩展因果加性模型(CAM)以包含高阶交互作用，使用有向无环超图表示结构，开发了贪婪CAM算法的扩展版本。

Result: 提供了超DAG的可识别性结果，扩展了典型的马尔可夫等价类，并证明了学习更复杂的超图结构可能带来更好的经验结果。

Conclusion: 引入高阶交互作用的因果结构学习不仅理论上可行，而且在实际应用中可能带来更好的性能，特别是在有限样本情况下。

Abstract: Causal structure learning has long been the central task of inferring causal
insights from data. Despite the abundance of real-world processes exhibiting
higher-order mechanisms, however, an explicit treatment of interactions in
causal discovery has received little attention. In this work, we focus on
extending the causal additive model (CAM) to additive models with higher-order
interactions. This second level of modularity we introduce to the structure
learning problem is most easily represented by a directed acyclic hypergraph
which extends the DAG. We introduce the necessary definitions and theoretical
tools to handle the novel structure we introduce and then provide
identifiability results for the hyper DAG, extending the typical Markov
equivalence classes. We next provide insights into why learning the more
complex hypergraph structure may actually lead to better empirical results. In
particular, more restrictive assumptions like CAM correspond to easier-to-learn
hyper DAGs and better finite sample complexity. We finally develop an extension
of the greedy CAM algorithm which can handle the more complex hyper DAG search
space and demonstrate its empirical usefulness in synthetic experiments.

*Lipeng Zu,Hansong Zhou,Xiaonan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出SADQ方法，通过建模环境动态和整合后继状态分布来解决DQN中目标更新依赖过时策略的问题，提高训练稳定性和学习效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DQN的目标更新依赖于从回放缓冲区采样的转换，这些转换可能来自过时的次优策略，导致学习信号不具信息性，增加更新过程的方差。

Method: SADQ使用随机转移模型显式建模环境动态，将后继状态分布整合到Q值估计过程中，实现更稳定和策略对齐的值更新，并探索更高效的动作选择策略。

Result: 理论证明SADQ保持无偏值估计同时减少训练方差，在标准RL基准和真实世界向量控制任务中，SADQ在稳定性和学习效率方面一致优于DQN变体。

Conclusion: SADQ通过建模环境动态和整合后继状态分布，有效解决了DQN中策略不对齐的问题，实现了更稳定和高效的强化学习。

Abstract: Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) estimate future returns by learning from transitions
sampled from a replay buffer. However, the target updates in DQN often rely on
next states generated by actions from past, potentially suboptimal, policy. As
a result, these states may not provide informative learning signals, causing
high variance into the update process. This issue is exacerbated when the
sampled transitions are poorly aligned with the agent's current policy. To
address this limitation, we propose the Successor-state Aggregation Deep
Q-Network (SADQ), which explicitly models environment dynamics using a
stochastic transition model. SADQ integrates successor-state distributions into
the Q-value estimation process, enabling more stable and policy-aligned value
updates. Additionally, it explores a more efficient action selection strategy
with the modeled transition structure. We provide theoretical guarantees that
SADQ maintains unbiased value estimates while reducing training variance. Our
extensive empirical results across standard RL benchmarks and real-world
vector-based control tasks demonstrate that SADQ consistently outperforms DQN
variants in both stability and learning efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交和协作平台中存在大量多元时间序列数据，其中早期互动（如浏览量、点赞）与后期高影响力结果（如引用量、销售额）之间存在时间滞后相关性，但缺乏标准化的数据集和研究框架。

Method: 构建了两个大规模基准数据集：arXiv（230万篇论文的访问量→引用量）和GitHub（300万个仓库的推送/星标→分支），并建立了参数化和非参数化回归基准模型。

Result: 验证了数据集中存在显著的领先-滞后动态关系，为LLF研究提供了实证基础，并建立了数据门户网站供下载和使用。

Conclusion: 该研究确立了领先-滞后预测作为一个新的预测范式，为在社交和使用数据中系统探索此类预测问题奠定了经验基础。

Abstract: Social and collaborative platforms emit multivariate time-series traces in
which early interactions-such as views, likes, or downloads-are followed,
sometimes months or years later, by higher impact like citations, sales, or
reviews. We formalize this setting as Lead-Lag Forecasting (LLF): given an
early usage channel (the lead), predict a correlated but temporally shifted
outcome channel (the lag). Despite the ubiquity of such patterns, LLF has not
been treated as a unified forecasting problem within the time-series community,
largely due to the absence of standardized datasets. To anchor research in LLF,
here we present two high-volume benchmark datasets-arXiv (accesses -> citations
of 2.3M papers) and GitHub (pushes/stars -> forks of 3M repositories)-and
outline additional domains with analogous lead-lag dynamics, including
Wikipedia (page views -> edits), Spotify (streams -> concert attendance),
e-commerce (click-throughs -> purchases), and LinkedIn profile (views ->
messages). Our datasets provide ideal testbeds for lead-lag forecasting, by
capturing long-horizon dynamics across years, spanning the full spectrum of
outcomes, and avoiding survivorship bias in sampling. We documented all
technical details of data curation and cleaning, verified the presence of
lead-lag dynamics through statistical and classification tests, and benchmarked
parametric and non-parametric baselines for regression. Our study establishes
LLF as a novel forecasting paradigm and lays an empirical foundation for its
systematic exploration in social and usage data. Our data portal with downloads
and documentation is available at https://lead-lag-forecasting.github.io/.

*Sanggeon Yun,Hyunwoo Oh,Ryozo Masukawa,Mohsen Imani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Decomposition is a proven way to shrink deep networks without changing I/O. We bring this idea to hyperdimensional computing (HDC), where footprint cuts usually shrink the feature axis and erode concentration and robustness. Prior HDC decompositions decode via fixed atomic hypervectors, which are ill-suited for compressing learned class prototypes. We introduce DecoHD, which learns directly in a decomposed HDC parameterization: a small, shared set of per-layer channels with multiplicative binding across layers and bundling at the end, yielding a large representational space from compact factors. DecoHD compresses along the class axis via a lightweight bundling head while preserving native bind-bundle-score; training is end-to-end, and inference remains pure HDC, aligning with in/near-memory accelerators. In evaluation, DecoHD attains extreme memory savings with only minor accuracy degradation under tight deployment budgets. On average it stays within about 0.1-0.15% of a strong non-reduced HDC baseline (worst case 5.7%), is more robust to random bit-flip noise, reaches its accuracy plateau with up to ~97% fewer trainable parameters, and -- in hardware -- delivers roughly 277x/35x energy/speed gains over a CPU (AMD Ryzen 9 9950X), 13.5x/3.7x over a GPU (NVIDIA RTX 4090), and 2.0x/2.4x over a baseline HDC ASIC.

Motivation: 从移动数据推断社会人口属性有助于交通规划，但由于移动模式与社会人口特征关系弱且不一致，以及跨情境泛化能力有限，这一任务仍然困难。

Method: 1) 引入基于有向移动图的高阶移动描述符；2) 开发模型置信度与准确性均衡的度量和可视化诊断工具；3) 构建多任务学习框架，从共享表示中联合预测多个社会人口属性。

Result: 新特征显著提高了年龄、性别、收入和家庭结构预测的准确性；多任务学习在训练数据有限或测试集分布与训练集不同时表现优于单任务模型。

Conclusion: 该方法通过行为基础特征、不确定性量化和多任务学习，有效解决了从移动数据推断社会人口属性的挑战，为交通规划提供了更好的工具。

Abstract: Inferring sociodemographic attributes from mobility data could help
transportation planners better leverage passively collected datasets, but this
task remains difficult due to weak and inconsistent relationships between
mobility patterns and sociodemographic traits, as well as limited
generalization across contexts. We address these challenges from three angles.
First, to improve predictive accuracy while retaining interpretability, we
introduce a behaviorally grounded set of higher-order mobility descriptors
based on directed mobility graphs. These features capture structured patterns
in trip sequences, travel modes, and social co-travel, and significantly
improve prediction of age, gender, income, and household structure over
baselines features. Second, we introduce metrics and visual diagnostic tools
that encourage evenness between model confidence and accuracy, enabling
planners to quantify uncertainty. Third, to improve generalization and sample
efficiency, we develop a multitask learning framework that jointly predicts
multiple sociodemographic attributes from a shared representation. This
approach outperforms single-task models, particularly when training data are
limited or when applying models across different time periods (i.e., when the
test set distribution differs from the training set).

Result: SynQuE代理指标在情感分析、Text2SQL、网页导航和图像分类等任务上与真实任务性能相关。在Text2SQL解析任务中，使用SynQuE选择的前3个合成数据集可将准确率从30.4%提升到38.4%（+8.1%）。LENS在复杂任务上表现最佳。

Conclusion: SynQuE为真实数据稀缺下的合成数据选择提供了实用框架，并推动了基于基础模型的数据表征和细粒度数据选择的未来研究。

Abstract: We introduce and formalize the Synthetic Dataset Quality Estimation (SynQuE)
problem: ranking synthetic datasets by their expected real-world task
performance using only limited unannotated real data. This addresses a critical
and open challenge where data is scarce due to collection costs or privacy
constraints. We establish the first comprehensive benchmarks for this problem
by introducing and evaluating proxy metrics that choose synthetic data for
training to maximize task performance on real data. We introduce the first
proxy metrics for SynQuE by adapting distribution and diversity-based distance
measures to our context via embedding models. To address the shortcomings of
these metrics on complex planning tasks, we propose LENS, a novel proxy that
leverages large language model reasoning. Our results show that SynQuE proxies
correlate with real task performance across diverse tasks, including sentiment
analysis, Text2SQL, web navigation, and image classification, with LENS
consistently outperforming others on complex tasks by capturing nuanced
characteristics. For instance, on text-to-SQL parsing, training on the top-3
synthetic datasets selected via SynQuE proxies can raise accuracy from 30.4% to
38.4 (+8.1)% on average compared to selecting data indiscriminately. This work
establishes SynQuE as a practical framework for synthetic data selection under
real-data scarcity and motivates future research on foundation model-based data
characterization and fine-grained data selection.

TL;DR: LogHD是一种超维计算压缩方法，通过对类别轴进行对数压缩，将内存需求从O(CD)降低到O(Dlog_k C)，同时保持维度D不变，在保持准确性的同时提高了能效和抗干扰能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准超维计算需要为每个类别存储一个原型向量，导致O(CD)的内存开销，这在内存、能耗和可靠性受限的系统中不可行。现有的特征轴压缩方法会降低鲁棒性。

Method: 使用对数类别轴压缩，用约log_k C个捆绑超向量替代C个类别原型，在n维激活空间中进行解码，并结合容量感知码本和基于配置文件的解码方法。

Result: 在相同内存下，LogHD能承受比特征轴压缩高2.5-3倍的比特翻转率；ASIC实现相比AMD Ryzen 9 9950X实现了498倍能效提升和62.6倍加速，相比NVIDIA RTX 4090分别提升24.3倍和6.58倍。

Conclusion: LogHD在保持超维计算优势的同时，显著降低了内存需求并提高了鲁棒性，特别适合资源受限的边缘计算系统。

Abstract: Hyperdimensional computing (HDC) suits memory, energy, and
reliability-constrained systems, yet the standard "one prototype per class"
design requires $O(CD)$ memory (with $C$ classes and dimensionality $D$). Prior
compaction reduces $D$ (feature axis), improving storage/compute but weakening
robustness. We introduce LogHD, a logarithmic class-axis reduction that
replaces the $C$ per-class prototypes with $n\!\approx\!\lceil\log_k C\rceil$
bundle hypervectors (alphabet size $k$) and decodes in an $n$-dimensional
activation space, cutting memory to $O(D\log_k C)$ while preserving $D$. LogHD
uses a capacity-aware codebook and profile-based decoding, and composes with
feature-axis sparsification. Across datasets and injected bit flips, LogHD
attains competitive accuracy with smaller models and higher resilience at
matched memory. Under equal memory, it sustains target accuracy at roughly
$2.5$-$3.0\times$ higher bit-flip rates than feature-axis compression; an ASIC
instantiation delivers $498\times$ energy efficiency and $62.6\times$ speedup
over an AMD Ryzen 9 9950X and $24.3\times$/$6.58\times$ over an NVIDIA RTX
4090, and is $4.06\times$ more energy-efficient and $2.19\times$ faster than a
feature-axis HDC ASIC baseline.

Conclusion: 该方法为高维马尔可夫模型中的变化检测提供了理论保证和实际可行性，避免了显式似然评估的困难。

Abstract: We address the problem of quickest change detection in Markov processes with
unknown transition kernels. The key idea is to learn the conditional score
$\nabla_{\mathbf{y}} \log p(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{x})$ directly from sample pairs
$( \mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})$, where both $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ are
high-dimensional data generated by the same transition kernel. In this way, we
avoid explicit likelihood evaluation and provide a practical way to learn the
transition dynamics. Based on this estimation, we develop a score-based CUSUM
procedure that uses conditional Hyvarinen score differences to detect changes
in the kernel. To ensure bounded increments, we propose a truncated version of
the statistic. With Hoeffding's inequality for uniformly ergodic Markov
processes, we prove exponential lower bounds on the mean time to false alarm.
We also prove asymptotic upper bounds on detection delay. These results give
both theoretical guarantees and practical feasibility for score-based detection
in high-dimensional Markov models.

has become a pressing requirement, driven by users' growing assertion of their
"right to be forgotten". However, existing CD models are largely designed
without privacy considerations and lack effective data unlearning mechanisms.
Directly applying general purpose unlearning algorithms is suboptimal, as they
struggle to balance unlearning completeness, model utility, and efficiency when
confronted with the unique heterogeneous structure of CD models. To address
this, our paper presents the first systematic study of the data unlearning
problem for CD models, proposing a novel and efficient algorithm: hierarchical
importanceguided forgetting (HIF). Our key insight is that parameter importance
in CD models exhibits distinct layer wise characteristics. HIF leverages this
via an innovative smoothing mechanism that combines individual and layer, level
importance, enabling a more precise distinction of parameters associated with
the data to be unlearned. Experiments on three real world datasets show that
HIF significantly outperforms baselines on key metrics, offering the first
effective solution for CD models to respond to user data removal requests and
for deploying high-performance, privacy preserving AI systems

Motivation: 研究高阶优化方法如何影响深度学习中的泛化性能，特别关注随机高斯牛顿方法在过参数化神经网络中的表现。

Method: 使用带Levenberg-Marquardt阻尼和mini-batch采样的随机高斯牛顿方法，在回归设置中训练具有平滑激活函数的过参数化深度神经网络。

Result: 建立了参数空间中的有限时间收敛界，以及基于一致稳定性的非渐近泛化界，揭示了曲率、批大小和过参数化对泛化性能的影响。

Conclusion: 识别了SGN的有利泛化机制，其中高斯牛顿矩阵沿优化路径的最小特征值越大，稳定性界越紧，泛化性能越好。

Abstract: An important question in deep learning is how higher-order optimization
methods affect generalization. In this work, we analyze a stochastic
Gauss-Newton (SGN) method with Levenberg-Marquardt damping and mini-batch
sampling for training overparameterized deep neural networks with smooth
activations in a regression setting. Our theoretical contributions are twofold.
First, we establish finite-time convergence bounds via a variable-metric
analysis in parameter space, with explicit dependencies on the batch size,
network width and depth. Second, we derive non-asymptotic generalization bounds
for SGN using uniform stability in the overparameterized regime, characterizing
the impact of curvature, batch size, and overparameterization on generalization
performance. Our theoretical results identify a favorable generalization regime
for SGN in which a larger minimum eigenvalue of the Gauss-Newton matrix along
the optimization path yields tighter stability bounds.

TL;DR: PETRA是一种基于进化轨迹的Transformer方法，通过系统发育树而非原始RNA序列来预测SARS-CoV-2突变，有效解决测序噪声和数据不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SARS-CoV-2的快速进化轨迹和免疫逃逸变体的持续出现对公共卫生和疫苗开发构成挑战，而现有GPT模型直接应用于嘈杂的病毒基因组序列存在局限性。

Method: 使用系统发育树衍生的进化轨迹而非原始RNA序列，采用加权训练框架解决全球序列数据的地理和时间不平衡问题。

Result: 在预测SARS-CoV-2突变方面表现优异，核苷酸突变的加权recall@1达到9.45%，刺突蛋白氨基酸突变为17.10%，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: PETRA能够有效预测SARS-CoV-2的未来突变，并实时预测主要进化支的突变，为病毒进化监测提供有力工具。

Abstract: Since its emergence, SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated a rapid and unpredictable
evolutionary trajectory, characterized by the continual emergence of
immune-evasive variants. This poses persistent challenges to public health and
vaccine development.
  While large-scale generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) have
revolutionized the modeling of sequential data, their direct applications to
noisy viral genomic sequences are limited. In this paper, we introduce
PETRA(Pretrained Evolutionary TRAnsformer), a novel transformer approach based
on evolutionary trajectories derived from phylogenetic trees rather than raw
RNA sequences. This method effectively mitigates sequencing noise and captures
the hierarchical structure of viral evolution.
  With a weighted training framework to address substantial geographical and
temporal imbalances in global sequence data, PETRA excels in predicting future
SARS-CoV-2 mutations, achieving a weighted recall@1 of 9.45% for nucleotide
mutations and 17.10\% for spike amino-acid mutations, compared to 0.49% and
6.64% respectively for the best baseline. PETRA also demonstrates its ability
to aid in the real-time mutation prediction of major clades like 24F(XEC) and
25A(LP.8.1). The code is open sourced on https://github.com/xz-keg/PETra

Motivation: 解决大规模预训练模型在多任务适应时面临的高计算成本和结构不稳定性挑战。

Method: 引入关系矩阵建模任务间依赖关系，将节点和路径相关性编码为图结构先验；通过低秩映射和可插拔机制在不同层嵌入模块化适配器，实现先验指导下的跨任务组合和重用。

Conclusion: 图先验和模块化机制在可组合微调中具有协同优势，能有效改善参数效率、训练稳定性，并缓解多任务场景中的路径冲突和冗余计算。

Abstract: This paper proposes a composable fine-tuning method that integrates graph
structural priors with modular adapters to address the high computational cost
and structural instability faced by large-scale pre-trained models in
multi-task adaptation. The method introduces a relation matrix to model
dependencies among tasks, explicitly encoding correlations between nodes and
paths into graph structural priors, which provide unified structural
constraints for adapter weight allocation and path selection. Modular adapters
are embedded into different layers through low-rank mapping and a pluggable
mechanism, enabling efficient cross-task composition and reuse under prior
guidance. This mechanism not only improves parameter efficiency and training
stability but also alleviates path conflicts and redundant computation in
multi-task scenarios. Furthermore, experiments on hyperparameter sensitivity,
environmental sensitivity, and data sensitivity are conducted to systematically
analyze key factors such as routing temperature, gating thresholds, and
relation matrix regularization strength, verifying the consistency and superior
performance of the method under structural constraints. The results demonstrate
that the proposed framework significantly enhances task prediction accuracy,
adapter weight allocation precision, and overall computational efficiency while
maintaining model lightweight design, highlighting the synergistic advantages
of graph priors and modular mechanisms in composable fine-tuning.

TL;DR: TwIST是一个分布式训练框架，通过并行训练多个子网络、定期聚合参数和重新采样来识别高质量稀疏子网络，实现零成本剪枝部署，在50%+高稀疏度下显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM稀疏化方法通常需要训练后校准或Hessian恢复等复杂步骤，TwIST旨在通过训练时识别高质量稀疏子网络，消除部署时的额外开销。

Method: 并行训练多个子网络，定期聚合参数并重新采样新子网络，识别无需后处理的"黄金票证"稀疏结构。

Result: 在50%+稀疏度下，TwIST达到23.14 PPL，显著优于基线方法的31.64 PPL，并产生结构化密集矩阵，在普通硬件上实现实际推理加速和内存减少。

Conclusion: TwIST提供了一种高效训练时路径，无需额外微调或恢复开销即可部署稀疏LLM。

Abstract: We introduce TwIST, a distributed training framework for efficient large
language model (LLM) sparsification. TwIST trains multiple subnetworks in
parallel, periodically aggregates their parameters, and resamples new
subnetworks during training. This process identifies high-quality subnetworks
("golden tickets") without requiring post-training procedures such as
calibration or Hessian-based recovery. As a result, TwIST enables zero-cost
pruning at deployment time while achieving perplexity competitive with
state-of-the-art post-training sparsification methods. The benefits are most
pronounced under aggressive sparsity (e.g., 50%+), where TwIST significantly
outperforms baseline methods; for example, reaching 23.14 PPL compared to 31.64
for the closest prior approach. Unlike unstructured pruning, TwIST produces
structured, dense matrices that offer practical inference speedups and memory
reductions on commodity hardware (e.g., CPUs) that do not support efficient
sparse computation. TwIST provides an efficient training-time path to
deployable sparse LLMs without additional fine-tuning or recovery overhead.

Abstract: The classification of diabetes and prediabetes by static glucose thresholds
obscures the pathophysiological dysglycemia heterogeneity, primarily driven by
insulin resistance (IR), beta-cell dysfunction, and incretin deficiency. This
review demonstrates that continuous glucose monitoring and wearable
technologies enable a paradigm shift towards non-invasive, dynamic metabolic
phenotyping. We show evidence that machine learning models can leverage
high-resolution glucose data from at-home, CGM-enabled oral glucose tolerance
tests to accurately predict gold-standard measures of muscle IR and beta-cell
function. This personalized characterization extends to real-world nutrition,
where an individual's unique postprandial glycemic response (PPGR) to
standardized meals, such as the relative glucose spike to potatoes versus
grapes, could serve as a biomarker for their metabolic subtype. Moreover,
integrating wearable data reveals that habitual diet, sleep, and physical
activity patterns, particularly their timing, are uniquely associated with
specific metabolic dysfunctions, informing precision lifestyle interventions.
The efficacy of dietary mitigators in attenuating PPGR is also shown to be
phenotype-dependent. Collectively, this evidence demonstrates that CGM can
deconstruct the complexity of early dysglycemia into distinct, actionable
subphenotypes. This approach moves beyond simple glycemic control, paving the
way for targeted nutritional, behavioral, and pharmacological strategies
tailored to an individual's core metabolic defects, thereby paving the way for
a new era of precision diabetes prevention.

Result: 在CTU-13网络流量数据上评估，Ca²⁺门控模型优于基线DNN，达到约98%准确率，假阳性和假阴性率降低，运行时开销可忽略。

Conclusion: 该Ca²⁺调制学习框架为需要快速适应演化数据模式的流式检测任务提供了通用解决方案，特别适用于网络安全应用。

Abstract: Network anomaly detection systems encounter several challenges with
traditional detectors trained offline. They become susceptible to concept drift
and new threats such as zero-day or polymorphic attacks. To address this
limitation, we propose a Ca$^{2+}$-modulated learning framework that draws
inspiration from astrocytic Ca$^{2+}$ signaling in the brain, where rapid,
context-sensitive adaptation enables robust information processing. Our
approach couples a multicellular astrocyte dynamics simulator with a deep
neural network (DNN). The simulator models astrocytic Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics
through three key mechanisms: IP$_3$-mediated Ca$^{2+}$ release, SERCA pump
uptake, and conductance-aware diffusion through gap junctions between cells.
Evaluation of our proposed network on CTU-13 (Neris) network traffic data
demonstrates the effectiveness of our biologically plausible approach. The
Ca$^{2+}$-gated model outperforms a matched baseline DNN, achieving up to
$\sim$98\% accuracy with reduced false positives and negatives across multiple
train/test splits. Importantly, this improved performance comes with negligible
runtime overhead once Ca$^{2+}$ trajectories are precomputed. While
demonstrated here for cybersecurity applications, this Ca$^{2+}$-modulated
learning framework offers a generic solution for streaming detection tasks that
require rapid, biologically grounded adaptation to evolving data patterns.

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了LLM在边缘设备部署的关键挑战，为资源受限环境下的高效LLM推理提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved near-human performance across
diverse reasoning tasks, yet their deployment on resource-constrained
Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices remains impractical due to massive parameter
footprints and memory-intensive autoregressive decoding. While split computing
offers a promising solution by partitioning model execution between edge
devices and cloud servers, existing approaches fail to address the unique
challenges of autoregressive inference, particularly the iterative token
generation process and expanding key-value (KV) cache requirements. This work
introduces the first autoregressive-aware split computing framework designed
explicitly for LLM deployment on edge devices. Our approach makes three key
contributions. First, we develop one-point split compression (OPSC), a
mixed-precision quantization scheme that prevents out-of-memory failures by
strategically partitioning models into front-end and back-end segments with
different precision levels. Second, we propose a two-stage intermediate
compression pipeline that combines threshold splitting (TS) and token-wise
adaptive bit quantization (TAB-Q) to preserve accuracy-critical activations
while dramatically reducing communication overhead. Third, we formulate a
unified optimization framework that jointly selects optimal split points,
quantization settings, and sequence lengths to satisfy strict memory and
latency constraints. Extensive evaluations across diverse LLMs and hardware
platforms demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
quantization methods, including SmoothQuant, OmniQuant, and Atom. The framework
achieves a 1.49 inference speedup and significant communication overhead
reduction while maintaining or improving model accuracy.

Abstract: Multimodal protein features play a crucial role in protein function
prediction. However, these features encompass a wide range of information,
ranging from structural data and sequence features to protein attributes and
interaction networks, making it challenging to decipher their complex
interconnections. In this work, we propose a multimodal protein function
prediction method (DSRPGO) by utilizing dynamic selection and reconstructive
pre-training mechanisms. To acquire complex protein information, we introduce
reconstructive pre-training to mine more fine-grained information with low
semantic levels. Moreover, we put forward the Bidirectional Interaction Module
(BInM) to facilitate interactive learning among multimodal features.
Additionally, to address the difficulty of hierarchical multi-label
classification in this task, a Dynamic Selection Module (DSM) is designed to
select the feature representation that is most conducive to current protein
function prediction. Our proposed DSRPGO model improves significantly in BPO,
MFO, and CCO on human datasets, thereby outperforming other benchmark models.

Abstract: Quantization plays a crucial role in accelerating the inference of
large-scale models, and rotational matrices have been shown to effectively
improve quantization performance by smoothing outliers. However, end-to-end
fine-tuning of rotational optimization algorithms incurs high computational
costs and is prone to overfitting. To address this challenge, we propose an
efficient distribution-aware rotational calibration method, DartQuant, which
reduces the complexity of rotational optimization by constraining the
distribution of the activations after rotation. This approach also effectively
reduces reliance on task-specific losses, thereby mitigating the risk of
overfitting. Additionally, we introduce the QR-Orth optimization scheme, which
replaces expensive alternating optimization with a more efficient solution. In
a variety of model quantization experiments, DartQuant demonstrates superior
performance. Compared to existing methods, it achieves 47$\times$ acceleration
and 10$\times$ memory savings for rotational optimization on a 70B model.
Furthermore, it is the first to successfully complete rotational calibration
for a 70B model on a single 3090 GPU, making quantization of large language
models feasible in resource-constrained environments. Code is available at

Abstract: Pediatric appendicitis remains one of the most common causes of acute
abdominal pain in children, and its diagnosis continues to challenge clinicians
due to overlapping symptoms and variable imaging quality. This study aims to
develop and evaluate a deep learning model based on a pretrained ResNet
architecture for automated detection of appendicitis from ultrasound images. We
used the Regensburg Pediatric Appendicitis Dataset, which includes ultrasound
scans, laboratory data, and clinical scores from pediatric patients admitted
with abdominal pain to Children Hospital. Hedwig in Regensburg, Germany. Each
subject had 1 to 15 ultrasound views covering the right lower quadrant,
appendix, lymph nodes, and related structures. For the image based
classification task, ResNet was fine tuned to distinguish appendicitis from

and augmentation to enhance generalization. The proposed ResNet model achieved
an overall accuracy of 93.44, precision of 91.53, and recall of 89.8,
demonstrating strong performance in identifying appendicitis across

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of the left atrium (LA) from cardiac MRI is critical
for guiding atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation and constructing biophysical
cardiac models. Manual delineation is time-consuming, observer-dependent, and
impractical for large-scale or time-sensitive clinical workflows. Deep learning
methods, particularly convolutional architectures, have recently demonstrated
superior performance in medical image segmentation tasks. In this study, we
applied the nnU-Net framework, an automated, self-configuring deep learning
segmentation architecture, to the Left Atrial Segmentation Challenge 2013
dataset. The dataset consists of thirty MRI scans with corresponding
expert-annotated masks. The nnU-Net model automatically adapted its
preprocessing, network configuration, and training pipeline to the
characteristics of the MRI data. Model performance was quantitatively evaluated
using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), and qualitative results were
compared against expert segmentations. The proposed nnUNet model achieved a
mean Dice score of 93.5, demonstrating high overlap with expert annotations and
outperforming several traditional segmentation approaches reported in previous
studies. The network exhibited robust generalization across variations in left
atrial shape, contrast, and image quality, accurately delineating both the

Abstract: Filtered Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search retrieves the closest
vectors for a query vector from a dataset. It enforces that a specified set of
discrete labels $S$ for the query must be included in the labels of each
retrieved vector. Existing graph-based methods typically incorporate filter
awareness by assigning fixed penalties or prioritizing nodes based on filter
satisfaction. However, since these methods use fixed, data in- dependent
penalties, they often fail to generalize across datasets with diverse label and
vector distributions. In this work, we propose a principled alternative that
learns the optimal trade-off between vector distance and filter match directly
from the data, rather than relying on fixed penalties. We formulate this as a
constrained linear optimization problem, deriving weights that better reflect
the underlying filter distribution and more effectively address the filtered
ANN search problem. These learned weights guide both the search process and
index construction, leading to graph structures that more effectively capture
the underlying filter distribution and filter semantics. Our experiments
demonstrate that adapting the distance function to the data significantly im-
proves accuracy by 5-10% over fixed-penalty methods, providing a more flexible
and generalizable framework for the filtered ANN search problem.

*Qingfeng Chen,Haojin Zeng,Jingyi Jie,Shichao Zhang,Debo Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了DeNoise框架，用于处理训练数据被异常图污染的图级异常检测问题，通过联合优化编码器和解码器来学习抗噪声嵌入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图神经网络方法通常假设训练集是干净的，但在实际应用中训练数据往往包含异常图，这会扭曲学习到的表示并严重影响性能。

Method: DeNoise框架联合优化图级编码器、属性解码器和结构解码器，采用对抗目标学习抗噪声嵌入；引入编码器锚点对齐去噪机制融合正常图的高信息节点嵌入；使用对比学习组件在潜在空间中压缩正常图嵌入并排斥异常图。

Result: 在8个真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，DeNoise在不同噪声强度下都能学习到可靠的图级表示，并显著优于最先进的UGAD基线方法。

Conclusion: DeNoise框架能够有效处理训练数据被污染的情况，为图级异常检测提供了鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of graph-structured data in critical domains,
unsupervised graph-level anomaly detection (UGAD) has become a pivotal task.
UGAD seeks to identify entire graphs that deviate from normal behavioral
patterns. However, most Graph Neural Network (GNN) approaches implicitly assume
that the training set is clean, containing only normal graphs, which is rarely
true in practice. Even modest contamination by anomalous graphs can distort
learned representations and sharply degrade performance. To address this
challenge, we propose DeNoise, a robust UGAD framework explicitly designed for
contaminated training data. It jointly optimizes a graph-level encoder, an
attribute decoder, and a structure decoder via an adversarial objective to
learn noise-resistant embeddings. Further, DeNoise introduces an encoder
anchor-alignment denoising mechanism that fuses high-information node
embeddings from normal graphs into all graph embeddings, improving
representation quality while suppressing anomaly interference. A contrastive
learning component then compacts normal graph embeddings and repels anomalous
ones in the latent space. Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets
demonstrate that DeNoise consistently learns reliable graph-level
representations under varying noise intensities and significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art UGAD baselines.

TL;DR: 该研究创建了韩国避税面板(KoTaP)，这是一个包含2011-2024年韩国上市公司的长期面板数据集，用于研究公司避税行为与盈余管理、盈利能力、稳定性、增长和公司治理等多个领域的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了建立一个标准化的韩国公司避税研究数据集，既能与国际文献保持一致，又能反映韩国特有的制度特征，为会计、金融和跨学科研究提供重要资源。

Method: 构建包含12,653个公司年度观测值的平衡面板数据集，使用现金有效税率(CETR)、GAAP有效税率(GETR)和账面税差异(TSTA、TSDA)等互补指标来衡量避税行为，并将避税作为预测变量与多个领域关联。

Result: 成功创建了KoTaP数据集，具有平衡面板结构和标准化变量，既保持了与国际文献的核心指标分布和相关性的一致性，又体现了韩国公司特有的集中所有权、高外资持股和高流动性比率等特征。

Conclusion: KoTaP是一个关键的开放资源，支持计量经济学和深度学习模型基准测试、外部有效性检验、可解释AI分析，以及政策评估、审计规划和投资分析等应用。

Abstract: This study introduces the Korean Tax Avoidance Panel (KoTaP), a long-term
panel dataset of non-financial firms listed on KOSPI and KOSDAQ between 2011
and 2024. After excluding financial firms, firms with non-December fiscal year
ends, capital impairment, and negative pre-tax income, the final dataset
consists of 12,653 firm-year observations from 1,754 firms. KoTaP is designed
to treat corporate tax avoidance as a predictor variable and link it to
multiple domains, including earnings management (accrual- and activity-based),
profitability (ROA, ROE, CFO, LOSS), stability (LEV, CUR, SIZE, PPE, AGE,
INVREC), growth (GRW, MB, TQ), and governance (BIG4, FORN, OWN). Tax avoidance
itself is measured using complementary indicators cash effective tax rate
(CETR), GAAP effective tax rate (GETR), and book-tax difference measures (TSTA,
TSDA) with adjustments to ensure interpretability. A key strength of KoTaP is
its balanced panel structure with standardized variables and its consistency
with international literature on the distribution and correlation of core
indicators. At the same time, it reflects distinctive institutional features of
Korean firms, such as concentrated ownership, high foreign shareholding, and
elevated liquidity ratios, providing both international comparability and
contextual uniqueness. KoTaP enables applications in benchmarking econometric
and deep learning models, external validity checks, and explainable AI
analyses. It further supports policy evaluation, audit planning, and investment
analysis, making it a critical open resource for accounting, finance, and
interdisciplinary research.

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成可解释的多元表达式，在保持预测精度的同时更好地识别数据背后的控制方程。

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) models complex systems by discovering mathematical
expressions that capture underlying relationships in observed data. However,
most SR methods prioritize minimizing prediction error over identifying the
governing equations, often producing overly complex or inaccurate expressions.
To address this, we present a decomposable SR method that generates
interpretable multivariate expressions leveraging transformer models, genetic
algorithms (GAs), and genetic programming (GP). In particular, our explainable
SR method distills a trained ``opaque'' regression model into mathematical
expressions that serve as explanations of its computed function. Our method
employs a Multi-Set Transformer to generate multiple univariate symbolic
skeletons that characterize how each variable influences the opaque model's
response. We then evaluate the generated skeletons' performance using a
GA-based approach to select a subset of high-quality candidates before
incrementally merging them via a GP-based cascade procedure that preserves
their original skeleton structure. The final multivariate skeletons undergo
coefficient optimization via a GA. We evaluated our method on problems with
controlled and varying degrees of noise, demonstrating lower or comparable
interpolation and extrapolation errors compared to two GP-based methods, three
neural SR methods, and a hybrid approach. Unlike them, our approach
consistently learned expressions that matched the original mathematical
structure.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了将大型语言模型作为端到端编译器的可行性，设计了CompilerEval评估框架，发现LLMs具备基本编译能力但成功率较低，通过优化提示、模型扩展和推理方法可显著提升汇编代码质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLMs已被用于辅助编译器开发，但其作为端到端编译器的潜力尚未充分探索。本文旨在研究LLM作为编译器(LaaC)的可行性及其未来发展。

Method: 设计了专门的CompilerEval数据集和评估框架，评估主流LLMs在源代码理解和汇编代码生成方面的能力，分析各种错误类型，探索多种改进LLM生成代码的方法，并评估跨平台编译能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，LLMs展现出作为编译器的基本能力，但当前编译成功率较低。通过优化提示、扩展模型规模和引入推理方法，可以显著提升LLM生成的汇编代码质量。

Conclusion: 对LaaC持乐观态度，提出了实用的架构设计和未来研究方向。相信通过针对性训练、知识丰富的提示和专用基础设施，LaaC有潜力生成高质量汇编代码并推动编译领域的范式转变。

Abstract: In recent years, end-to-end Large Language Model (LLM) technology has shown
substantial advantages across various domains. As critical system software and
infrastructure, compilers are responsible for transforming source code into
target code. While LLMs have been leveraged to assist in compiler development
and maintenance, their potential as an end-to-end compiler remains largely
unexplored. This paper explores the feasibility of LLM as a Compiler (LaaC) and
its future directions. We designed the CompilerEval dataset and framework
specifically to evaluate the capabilities of mainstream LLMs in source code
comprehension and assembly code generation. In the evaluation, we analyzed
various errors, explored multiple methods to improve LLM-generated code, and
evaluated cross-platform compilation capabilities. Experimental results
demonstrate that LLMs exhibit basic capabilities as compilers but currently
achieve low compilation success rates. By optimizing prompts, scaling up the
model, and incorporating reasoning methods, the quality of assembly code
generated by LLMs can be significantly enhanced. Based on these findings, we
maintain an optimistic outlook for LaaC and propose practical architectural
designs and future research directions. We believe that with targeted training,
knowledge-rich prompts, and specialized infrastructure, LaaC has the potential
to generate high-quality assembly code and drive a paradigm shift in the field
of compilation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了交换策略优化（EPO）框架，用于解决具有无限约束的半无限安全强化学习问题，通过迭代求解有限约束子问题并自适应调整活动约束集，确保策略性能最优且安全约束严格有界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际应用中安全强化学习常涉及无限约束（半无限安全RL），如需要在连续参数空间（如每个空间位置）强制执行安全条件，现有方法难以处理此类问题。

Method: EPO通过迭代求解有限约束安全RL子问题，自适应调整活动约束集：违反预定义容差的约束被添加，拉格朗日乘子为零的约束被删除，防止工作集无限增长。

Result: 理论分析表明，在温和假设下，通过EPO训练的策略达到与最优解相当的性能，且全局约束违反严格保持在预定界限内。

Conclusion: EPO为半无限安全RL问题提供了有效的算法框架，能够平衡策略性能和安全约束，确保确定性有界安全性。

Abstract: Safe reinforcement learning (safe RL) aims to respect safety requirements
while optimizing long-term performance. In many practical applications,
however, the problem involves an infinite number of constraints, known as
semi-infinite safe RL (SI-safe RL). Such constraints typically appear when
safety conditions must be enforced across an entire continuous parameter space,
such as ensuring adequate resource distribution at every spatial location. In
this paper, we propose exchange policy optimization (EPO), an algorithmic
framework that achieves optimal policy performance and deterministic bounded
safety. EPO works by iteratively solving safe RL subproblems with finite
constraint sets and adaptively adjusting the active set through constraint
expansion and deletion. At each iteration, constraints with violations
exceeding the predefined tolerance are added to refine the policy, while those
with zero Lagrange multipliers are removed after the policy update. This
exchange rule prevents uncontrolled growth of the working set and supports
effective policy training. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that, under
mild assumptions, strategies trained via EPO achieve performance comparable to
optimal solutions with global constraint violations strictly remaining within a
prescribed bound.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了如何通过迁移学习将数据丰富机场训练的生成模型高效适配到数据稀缺机场，使用扩散模型和流匹配方法在苏黎世和都柏林机场轨迹数据上进行实验，结果显示仅需5-20%的目标数据即可达到基准性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多二级和区域机场面临严重的轨迹数据稀缺问题，这限制了机器学习方法的应用和大规模模拟分析的能力，需要寻找减少数据需求的方法。

Method: 采用最先进的扩散模型和流匹配架构，在苏黎世机场预训练模型，然后在都柏林机场使用不同比例（0%-100%）的本地数据进行微调，评估模型的迁移性能。

Result: 扩散模型仅需5%的都柏林数据即可达到竞争性性能，约20%数据时达到基准水平，始终优于从头训练的模型；流匹配模型迁移效果较弱。

Conclusion: 迁移学习可以显著降低空中交通管理中轨迹生成的数据需求，即使在历史记录有限的环境中也能实现现实的合成数据生成。

Abstract: Access to trajectory data is a key requirement for developing and validating
Air Traffic Management (ATM) solutions, yet many secondary and regional
airports face severe data scarcity. This limits the applicability of machine
learning methods and the ability to perform large-scale simulations or
"what-if" analyses. In this paper, we investigate whether generative models
trained on data-rich airports can be efficiently adapted to data-scarce
airports using transfer learning. We adapt state-of-the-art diffusion- and
flow-matching-based architectures to the aviation domain and evaluate their
transferability between Zurich (source) and Dublin (target) landing trajectory
datasets. Models are pretrained on Zurich and fine-tuned on Dublin with varying
amounts of local data, ranging from 0% to 100%. Results show that
diffusion-based models achieve competitive performance with as little as 5% of
the Dublin data and reach baseline-level performance around 20%, consistently
outperforming models trained from scratch across metrics and visual
inspections. Latent flow matching and latent diffusion models also benefit from
pretraining, though with more variable gains, while flow matching models show
weaker generalization. Despite challenges in capturing rare trajectory
patterns, these findings demonstrate the potential of transfer learning to
substantially reduce data requirements for trajectory generation in ATM,
enabling realistic synthetic data generation even in environments with limited
historical records.

Abstract: This study proposes a Transformer-based longitudinal modeling method to
address challenges in clinical risk classification with heterogeneous
Electronic Health Record (EHR) data, including irregular temporal patterns,
large modality differences, and complex semantic structures. The method takes
multi-source medical features as input and employs a feature embedding layer to
achieve a unified representation of structured and unstructured data. A
learnable temporal encoding mechanism is introduced to capture dynamic
evolution under uneven sampling intervals. The core model adopts a multi-head
self-attention structure to perform global dependency modeling on longitudinal
sequences, enabling the aggregation of long-term trends and short-term
fluctuations across different temporal scales. To enhance semantic
representation, a semantic-weighted pooling module is designed to assign
adaptive importance to key medical events, improving the discriminative ability
of risk-related features. Finally, a linear mapping layer generates
individual-level risk scores. Experimental results show that the proposed model
outperforms traditional machine learning and temporal deep learning models in
accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-Score, achieving stable and precise risk
identification in multi-source heterogeneous EHR environments and providing an
efficient and reliable framework for clinical intelligent decision-making.

Method: 提出了联合调优权重衰减、温度缩放和早停策略的方法，并设计了一种部分重叠的保留策略，在实现联合评估和最大化训练数据使用之间取得平衡。

Result: 联合调优集成通常能匹配或提高性能，但在不同任务和指标上的效果大小存在显著差异。部分重叠保留策略提供了一个有吸引力的实用解决方案。

Conclusion: 研究结果揭示了深度集成训练中个体优化与联合优化之间的权衡，为实践者优化深度集成模型提供了有价值的见解和指导。

Abstract: Deep ensembles are a powerful tool in machine learning, improving both model
performance and uncertainty calibration. While ensembles are typically formed
by training and tuning models individually, evidence suggests that jointly
tuning the ensemble can lead to better performance. This paper investigates the
impact of jointly tuning weight decay, temperature scaling, and early stopping
on both predictive performance and uncertainty quantification. Additionally, we
propose a partially overlapping holdout strategy as a practical compromise
between enabling joint evaluation and maximizing the use of data for training.
Our results demonstrate that jointly tuning the ensemble generally matches or
improves performance, with significant variation in effect size across
different tasks and metrics. We highlight the trade-offs between individual and
joint optimization in deep ensemble training, with the overlapping holdout
strategy offering an attractive practical solution. We believe our findings
provide valuable insights and guidance for practitioners looking to optimize
deep ensemble models. Code is available at:

Motivation: 随着DNN模型规模和复杂度的增加，传统基于加法计算单元模型的预测方法准确性有限，而图增强建模虽然性能更好但数据收集成本过高，需要平衡准确性、泛化性和数据收集成本的方法。

Method: 提出ScaleDL框架，结合非线性分层建模和GNN交叉层交互机制，并使用D-optimal方法降低数据收集成本。

Conclusion: ScaleDL在DNN运行时预测方面实现了准确性、泛化性和数据收集成本之间的良好平衡，为优化开发和资源分配提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) form the cornerstone of modern AI services,
supporting a wide range of applications, including autonomous driving,
chatbots, and recommendation systems. As models increase in size and
complexity, DNN workloads like training and inference tasks impose
unprecedented demands on distributed computing resources, making the accurate
prediction of runtime essential for optimizing development and resource
allocation. Traditional methods rely on additive computational unit models,
limiting their accuracy and generalizability. In contrast, graph-enhanced
modeling improves performance but significantly increases data collection
costs. Therefore, there is a critical need for a method that strikes a balance
between accuracy, generalizability, and the costs of data collection. To
address these challenges, we propose ScaleDL, a novel runtime prediction
framework that combines nonlinear layer-wise modeling with graph neural network
(GNN)-based cross-layer interaction mechanism, enabling accurate DNN runtime
prediction and hierarchical generalizability across different network
architectures. Additionally, we employ the D-optimal method to reduce data
collection costs. Experiments on the workloads of five popular DNN models prove
that ScaleDL enhances runtime prediction accuracy and generalizability,
achieving 6$\times$ lower MRE and 5$\times$ lower RMSE compared to baseline
models.

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了PTQ方法在MXFP4格式下的表现，发现GPTQ方法表现稳定，而基于旋转的方法与MXFP4存在严重不兼容。通过分析发现根本原因是MXFP4的PoT块缩放与全局旋转的能量重分配不匹配，并提出了有效的块旋转策略来改进旋转方法在MXFP4上的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs规模快速增长带来了巨大的内存、计算和能耗成本，PTQ是实现高效部署的有前景方案。然而，在新型MXFP4格式下实现准确的W4A4量化仍是一个开放挑战，需要评估现有PTQ方法在新格式下的适用性。

Method: 建立了MXFP4格式下PTQ方法的综合基准测试，系统评估了包括GPTQ和基于旋转的方法在内的多种技术。通过深入分析发现了MXFP4的PoT块缩放与全局旋转之间的根本冲突，并提出了块旋转策略来适配旋转方法。

Result: 评估发现GPTQ方法在MXFP4格式下表现稳定，而基于旋转的方法（几乎所有SOTA方法都使用）与MXFP4存在严重不兼容。提出的块旋转策略显著提高了旋转方法在MXFP4上的准确性，在多种LLMs上取得了实质性改进。

Conclusion: 研究结果为从业者提供了明确的指导，并为在新兴低精度格式下推进PTQ研究奠定了基础。提出的块旋转策略有效解决了MXFP4与旋转方法之间的兼容性问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, but their
rapidly growing scale imposes prohibitive costs in memory, computation, and
energy. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a promising solution for efficient
deployment, yet achieving accurate W4A4 quantization remains an open challenge.
While most existing methods are designed for INT4 formats, the emergence of
MXFP4 -- a new FP4 format with various hardware support (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel)--
raises questions about the applicability of current techniques. In this work,
we establish a comprehensive benchmark of PTQ methods under the MXFP4 format.
Through systematic evaluation, we find that methods like GPTQ consistently
deliver strong performance, whereas rotation-based approaches, which are almost
used by all state-of-the-art approaches, suffer from severe incompatibility
with MXFP4. We further provide the first in-depth analysis of this conflict,
tracing its root to a fundamental mismatch between MXFP4's PoT (power-of-two)
block scaling and the redistribution of outlier energy via global rotation.
Building on this insight, we propose a simple yet effective block rotation
strategy that adapts rotation-based methods to MXFP4, leading to substantial
accuracy improvements across diverse LLMs. Our findings not only offer clear
guidance for practitioners but also set a foundation for advancing PTQ research
under emerging low-precision formats.

Motivation: 当前强彩票票假设理论尚未涵盖Transformer架构中的核心组件——多头注意力机制，需要填补这一理论空白。

Method: 通过理论分析证明，在随机初始化的多头注意力机制中，当关键和值的隐藏维度为O(dlog(Hd^{3/2}))时，高概率包含能近似任意目标多头注意力的强彩票票。

Result: 实证验证表明，源模型（多头注意力和Transformer）中的强彩票票与近似目标对应物之间的逼近误差随源模型隐藏维度的增加呈指数级下降。

Conclusion: 成功将强彩票票假设扩展到多头注意力机制和无归一化层的Transformer架构，为这些架构中存在高性能子网络提供了理论保证。

Abstract: The strong lottery ticket hypothesis (SLTH) conjectures that high-performing
subnetworks, called strong lottery tickets (SLTs), are hidden in randomly
initialized neural networks. Although recent theoretical studies have
established the SLTH across various neural architectures, the SLTH for
transformer architectures still lacks theoretical understanding. In particular,
the current theory of the SLTH does not yet account for the multi-head
attention (MHA) mechanism, a core component of transformers. To address this
gap, we introduce a theoretical analysis of the existence of SLTs within MHAs.
We prove that, if a randomly initialized MHA of $H$ heads and input dimension
$d$ has the hidden dimension $O(d\log(Hd^{3/2}))$ for the key and value, it
contains an SLT that approximates an arbitrary MHA with the same input
dimension with high probability. Furthermore, by leveraging this theory for
MHAs, we extend the SLTH to transformers without normalization layers. We
empirically validate our theoretical findings, demonstrating that the
approximation error between the SLT within a source model (MHA and transformer)
and an approximate target counterpart decreases exponentially by increasing the
hidden dimension of the source model.

Abstract: Recent advances in computational methods for designing biological sequences
have sparked the development of metrics to evaluate these methods performance
in terms of the fidelity of the designed sequences to a target distribution and
their attainment of desired properties. However, a single software library
implementing these metrics was lacking. In this work we introduce seqme, a
modular and highly extendable open-source Python library, containing
model-agnostic metrics for evaluating computational methods for biological
sequence design. seqme considers three groups of metrics: sequence-based,
embedding-based, and property-based, and is applicable to a wide range of
biological sequences: small molecules, DNA, ncRNA, mRNA, peptides and proteins.
The library offers a number of embedding and property models for biological
sequences, as well as diagnostics and visualization functions to inspect the
results. seqme can be used to evaluate both one-shot and iterative
computational design methods.

Abstract: Time series classification is a task of paramount importance, as this kind of
data often arises in safety-critical applications. However, it is typically
tackled with black-box deep learning methods, making it hard for humans to
understand the rationale behind their output. To take on this challenge, we
propose a novel approach, STELLE (Signal Temporal logic Embedding for
Logically-grounded Learning and Explanation), a neuro-symbolic framework that
unifies classification and explanation through direct embedding of trajectories
into a space of temporal logic concepts. By introducing a novel STL-inspired
kernel that maps raw time series to their alignment with predefined STL
formulae, our model jointly optimises accuracy and interpretability, as each
prediction is accompanied by the most relevant logical concepts that
characterise it. This yields (i) local explanations as human-readable STL
conditions justifying individual predictions, and (ii) global explanations as
class-characterising formulae. Experiments demonstrate that STELLE achieves
competitive accuracy while providing logically faithful explanations, validated
on diverse real-world benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合RLHF可扩展性和PBO样本效率的混合框架，通过集成主动查询模块来高效收集偏好数据


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从人类偏好中学习是使机器学习模型与人类主观判断对齐的关键，但收集偏好数据成本高昂且耗时，需要更高效的学习范式

Method: 在RLHF流程中集成主动查询模块，结合RLHF的可扩展性和PBO的查询效率，实现主动和样本高效的偏好收集

Result: 在高维偏好优化和LLM微调两个代表性领域验证，实验结果显示在样本效率和整体性能方面都有持续改进

Conclusion: 该混合框架成功地将RLHF的可扩展性与PBO的样本效率相结合，为偏好学习提供了更高效的解决方案

Abstract: Learning from human preferences is a cornerstone of aligning machine learning
models with subjective human judgments. Yet, collecting such preference data is
often costly and time-consuming, motivating the need for more efficient
learning paradigms. Two established approaches offer complementary advantages:
RLHF scales effectively to high-dimensional tasks such as LLM fine-tuning,
while PBO achieves greater sample efficiency through active querying. We
propose a hybrid framework that unifies RLHF's scalability with PBO's query
efficiency by integrating an acquisition-driven module into the RLHF pipeline,
thereby enabling active and sample-efficient preference gathering. We validate
the proposed approach on two representative domains: (i) high-dimensional
preference optimization and (ii) LLM fine-tuning. Experimental results
demonstrate consistent improvements in both sample efficiency and overall
performance across these tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合最近邻搜索的差分隐私上下文学习框架，通过隐私过滤器跟踪累积隐私成本，在文本分类和文档问答任务上显著优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有差分隐私上下文学习方法忽视了现代大语言模型流程中的关键组件——用于检索相关上下文数据的相似性搜索，存在隐私风险。

Method: 采用最近邻检索从上下文数据库中获取相关示例，结合隐私过滤器跟踪选定样本的累积隐私成本，确保符合中心差分隐私预算。

Result: 在所有评估基准测试中大幅优于现有基线方法，实现了更优的隐私-效用权衡。

Conclusion: 提出的隐私感知最近邻搜索框架为差分隐私上下文学习提供了有效解决方案，显著提升了隐私保护下的模型性能。

Abstract: Differentially private in-context learning (DP-ICL) has recently become an
active research topic due to the inherent privacy risks of in-context learning.
However, existing approaches overlook a critical component of modern large
language model (LLM) pipelines: the similarity search used to retrieve relevant
context data. In this work, we introduce a DP framework for in-context learning
that integrates nearest neighbor search of relevant examples in a privacy-aware
manner. Our method outperforms existing baselines by a substantial margin
across all evaluated benchmarks, achieving more favorable privacy-utility
trade-offs. To achieve this, we employ nearest neighbor retrieval from a
database of context data, combined with a privacy filter that tracks the
cumulative privacy cost of selected samples to ensure adherence to a central
differential privacy budget. Experimental results on text classification and
document question answering show a clear advantage of the proposed method over
existing baselines.

*Tim Tomov,Dominik Fuchsgruber,Tom Wollschläger,Stephan Günnemann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 现有不确定性量化方法在无歧义任务上表现良好，但在歧义数据上性能接近随机水平，揭示了当前LLM不确定性量化方法的关键缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实语言具有内在歧义性，反映随机不确定性，但现有UQ方法通常在无歧义任务上进行基准测试，无法处理歧义数据。

Method: 引入MAQA*和AmbigQA*数据集，配备基于事实共现估计的真实答案分布；评估三种不确定性估计范式：预测分布本身、模型内部表示和模型集成。

Result: 当前不确定性估计器在歧义数据上性能严重退化至接近随机水平；预测分布和集成基估计器在歧义性下存在根本性限制。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前LLM不确定性量化方法的关键缺陷，需要重新思考当前建模范式以处理语言歧义性。

Abstract: Accurate uncertainty quantification (UQ) in Large Language Models (LLMs) is
critical for trustworthy deployment. While real-world language is inherently
ambiguous, reflecting aleatoric uncertainty, existing UQ methods are typically
benchmarked against tasks with no ambiguity. In this work, we demonstrate that
while current uncertainty estimators perform well under the restrictive
assumption of no ambiguity, they degrade to close-to-random performance on
ambiguous data. To this end, we introduce MAQA* and AmbigQA*, the first
ambiguous question-answering (QA) datasets equipped with ground-truth answer
distributions estimated from factual co-occurrence. We find this performance
deterioration to be consistent across different estimation paradigms: using the
predictive distribution itself, internal representations throughout the model,
and an ensemble of models. We show that this phenomenon can be theoretically
explained, revealing that predictive-distribution and ensemble-based estimators
are fundamentally limited under ambiguity. Overall, our study reveals a key
shortcoming of current UQ methods for LLMs and motivates a rethinking of
current modeling paradigms.

*Federico Pirola,Fabio Stella,Marco Grzegorczyk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Gibbs采样的动态贝叶斯网络学习方法，用于处理临床数据中的缺失值，通过将缺失值视为高斯分布参数进行采样，在ICU数据上表现出优于传统方法的重建精度和收敛性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有处理纵向临床数据缺失值的方法主要源自静态贝叶斯网络，未能充分考虑数据的时间特性，限制了时间不确定性量化能力，这在重症监护等需要理解时间动态的临床环境中尤为重要。

Method: 使用Gibbs采样方法学习动态贝叶斯网络，将每个缺失值视为服从高斯分布的未知参数，在每次迭代中从未观测值的完全条件分布中采样，实现原则性的插补和不确定性估计。

Result: 在模拟数据集和真实ICU患者数据上的评估显示，相比MICE等标准模型无关技术，该贝叶斯方法具有更优的重建精度和收敛特性。

Conclusion: 在时间模型中整合完全贝叶斯推断具有临床相关性，能提供更可靠的插补结果和更深入的模型行为洞察，支持更安全、更明智的临床决策，特别是在缺失数据频繁且影响重大的环境中。

Abstract: Dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) are increasingly used in healthcare due to
their ability to model complex temporal relationships in patient data while
maintaining interpretability, an essential feature for clinical
decision-making. However, existing approaches to handling missing data in
longitudinal clinical datasets are largely derived from static Bayesian
networks literature, failing to properly account for the temporal nature of the
data. This gap limits the ability to quantify uncertainty over time, which is
particularly critical in settings such as intensive care, where understanding
the temporal dynamics is fundamental for model trustworthiness and
applicability across diverse patient groups. Despite the potential of DBNs, a
full Bayesian framework that integrates missing data handling remains
underdeveloped. In this work, we propose a novel Gibbs sampling-based method
for learning DBNs from incomplete data. Our method treats each missing value as
an unknown parameter following a Gaussian distribution. At each iteration, the
unobserved values are sampled from their full conditional distributions,
allowing for principled imputation and uncertainty estimation. We evaluate our
method on both simulated datasets and real-world intensive care data from
critically ill patients. Compared to standard model-agnostic techniques such as
MICE, our Bayesian approach demonstrates superior reconstruction accuracy and
convergence properties. These results highlight the clinical relevance of
incorporating full Bayesian inference in temporal models, providing more
reliable imputations and offering deeper insight into model behavior. Our
approach supports safer and more informed clinical decision-making,
particularly in settings where missing data are frequent and potentially
impactful.

TL;DR: SynthKGQA是一个从知识图谱生成高质量合成问答数据集的框架，用于改进知识图谱检索器的评估和训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏具有真实标注的具有挑战性的知识图谱问答数据集，难以比较不同的知识图谱检索方法。

Method: 开发了SynthKGQA框架，可以从任何知识图谱生成合成问答数据集，提供完整的真实事实用于问题推理。

Result: 应用SynthKGQA到Wikidata生成了GTSQA数据集，该数据集专门测试知识图谱检索器在未见过的图结构和关系类型上的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: SynthKGQA不仅能够实现更丰富的信息化基准测试，还能训练出更好的模型，为知识图谱增强的LLMs提供了有效的评估工具。

Abstract: Retrieval of information from graph-structured knowledge bases represents a
promising direction for improving the factuality of LLMs. While various
solutions have been proposed, a comparison of methods is difficult due to the
lack of challenging QA datasets with ground-truth targets for graph retrieval.
We present SynthKGQA, a framework for generating high-quality synthetic
Knowledge Graph Question Answering datasets from any Knowledge Graph, providing
the full set of ground-truth facts in the KG to reason over each question. We
show how, in addition to enabling more informative benchmarking of KG
retrievers, the data produced with SynthKGQA also allows us to train better
models. We apply SynthKGQA to Wikidata to generate GTSQA, a new dataset
designed to test zero-shot generalization abilities of KG retrievers with
respect to unseen graph structures and relation types, and benchmark popular
solutions for KG-augmented LLMs on it.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出SCER方法，通过正则化特征表示来抑制虚假相关性，提升深度学习模型在最差群体上的鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型容易依赖虚假相关性，在分布偏移特别是子群体偏移场景下表现不佳，现有方法缺乏连接嵌入空间表示与最差群体误差的理论框架

Method: 提出SCER方法，在嵌入层面对特征表示进行正则化，识别核心特征方向与虚假特征方向，通过理论约束抑制模型对虚假模式的敏感性

Result: 在多个视觉和语言任务上的系统评估表明，SCER在最差群体准确率上优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: SCER通过理论驱动的嵌入正则化有效提升了模型在最差群体上的鲁棒性，为处理虚假相关性提供了新思路

Abstract: Deep learning models achieve strong performance across various domains but
often rely on spurious correlations, making them vulnerable to distribution
shifts. This issue is particularly severe in subpopulation shift scenarios,
where models struggle in underrepresented groups. While existing methods have
made progress in mitigating this issue, their performance gains are still
constrained. They lack a rigorous theoretical framework connecting the
embedding space representations with worst-group error. To address this
limitation, we propose Spurious Correlation-Aware Embedding Regularization for
Worst-Group Robustness (SCER), a novel approach that directly regularizes
feature representations to suppress spurious cues. We show theoretically that
worst-group error is influenced by how strongly the classifier relies on
spurious versus core directions, identified from differences in group-wise mean
embeddings across domains and classes. By imposing theoretical constraints at
the embedding level, SCER encourages models to focus on core features while
reducing sensitivity to spurious patterns. Through systematic evaluation on
multiple vision and language, we show that SCER outperforms prior
state-of-the-art studies in worst-group accuracy. Our code is available at

*Jayadeva,Naman Dwivedi,Hari Krishnan,N. M. Anoop Krishnan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文建立了回归与分类之间的形式化等价关系，证明了M个样本的回归问题等价于2M个样本的线性可分分类任务，并基于此提出了新的回归公式和可回归性度量方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 回归与分类之间的形式化联系一直很薄弱，支持向量回归中的边界最大化项通常只被解释为正则化器，缺乏理论依据。

Method: 通过证明回归问题与分类问题的等价性，将M个样本的回归转化为2M个样本的线性可分分类任务，并利用边界最大化推导出新的回归公式。

Result: 提出了可回归性度量方法，可以在不先学习模型的情况下估计数据集的回归难度；还训练神经网络学习线性化映射，将输入变量转换到线性回归器足够适用的空间。

Conclusion: 建立了回归与分类的严格等价关系，为回归问题提供了新的理论框架和实用工具，包括可回归性度量和线性化映射方法。

Abstract: A formal link between regression and classification has been tenuous. Even
though the margin maximization term $\|w\|$ is used in support vector
regression, it has at best been justified as a regularizer. We show that a
regression problem with $M$ samples lying on a hyperplane has a one-to-one
equivalence with a linearly separable classification task with $2M$ samples. We
show that margin maximization on the equivalent classification task leads to a
different regression formulation than traditionally used. Using the
equivalence, we demonstrate a ``regressability'' measure, that can be used to
estimate the difficulty of regressing a dataset, without needing to first learn
a model for it. We use the equivalence to train neural networks to learn a
linearizing map, that transforms input variables into a space where a linear
regressor is adequate.

### [164] [ForecastGAN: A Decomposition-Based Adversarial Framework for Multi-Horizon Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04445)
*Syeda Sitara Wishal Fatima,Afshin Rahimi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ForecastGAN是一个基于分解的对抗性框架，用于多时间跨度预测，通过三个模块（分解、模型选择、对抗训练）有效整合数值和分类特征，在短期预测中优于transformer模型，长期预测保持竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有transformer模型在短期预测中表现不佳且通常忽略分类特征，需要一种能适应不同预测跨度并有效整合各类特征的通用预测方法。

Method: 使用三个集成模块：分解模块提取季节性和趋势成分；模型选择模块根据预测跨度选择最优神经网络配置；对抗训练模块通过条件生成对抗网络增强预测鲁棒性。

Result: 在11个基准多变量时间序列数据集上的验证表明，ForecastGAN在短期预测中持续优于最先进的transformer模型，在长期预测中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 该研究建立了一种更通用的时间序列预测方法，能够适应特定情境，在不同数据特征下保持强性能，无需大量超参数调优。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is essential across domains from finance to supply
chain management. This paper introduces ForecastGAN, a novel decomposition
based adversarial framework addressing limitations in existing approaches for
multi-horizon predictions. Although transformer models excel in long-term
forecasting, they often underperform in short-term scenarios and typically
ignore categorical features. ForecastGAN operates through three integrated
modules: a Decomposition Module that extracts seasonality and trend components;
a Model Selection Module that identifies optimal neural network configurations
based on forecasting horizon; and an Adversarial Training Module that enhances
prediction robustness through Conditional Generative Adversarial Network
training. Unlike conventional approaches, ForecastGAN effectively integrates
both numerical and categorical features. We validate our framework on eleven
benchmark multivariate time series datasets that span various forecasting
horizons. The results show that ForecastGAN consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art transformer models for short-term forecasting while remaining
competitive for long-term horizons. This research establishes a more
generalizable approach to time series forecasting that adapts to specific
contexts while maintaining strong performance across diverse data
characteristics without extensive hyperparameter tuning.

TL;DR: 提出了两种联邦学习中的非凸-PL极小极大优化算法Fed-NSGDA-M和FedMuon-DA，用于处理重尾梯度噪声，在较温和条件下达到收敛速率O(1/(TNp)^{(s-1)/(2s)})。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重尾噪声在非凸随机优化中日益受到关注，因为实证研究表明它比标准有界方差假设更符合实际情况。本文研究联邦学习环境下重尾梯度噪声下的非凸-PL极小极大优化问题。

Method: 提出了两种新算法：Fed-NSGDA-M（整合归一化梯度）和FedMuon-DA（利用Muon优化器进行本地更新），两者都旨在有效处理联邦极小极大优化中的重尾噪声。

Result: 理论证明两种算法都能达到O(1/(TNp)^{(s-1)/(2s)})的收敛速率，这是首个在重尾噪声下具有严格理论保证的联邦极小极大优化算法。

Conclusion: 广泛的实验进一步验证了所提出算法的有效性，为解决联邦学习中重尾噪声下的非凸极小极大优化问题提供了理论保证和实用解决方案。

Abstract: Heavy-tailed noise has attracted growing attention in nonconvex stochastic
optimization, as numerous empirical studies suggest it offers a more realistic
assumption than standard bounded variance assumption. In this work, we
investigate nonconvex-PL minimax optimization under heavy-tailed gradient noise
in federated learning. We propose two novel algorithms: Fed-NSGDA-M, which
integrates normalized gradients, and FedMuon-DA, which leverages the Muon
optimizer for local updates. Both algorithms are designed to effectively
address heavy-tailed noise in federated minimax optimization, under a milder
condition. We theoretically establish that both algorithms achieve a
convergence rate of $O({1}/{(TNp)^{\frac{s-1}{2s}}})$. To the best of our
knowledge, these are the first federated minimax optimization algorithms with
rigorous theoretical guarantees under heavy-tailed noise. Extensive experiments
further validate their effectiveness.

TL;DR: 提出TNCM-VAE模型，结合变分自编码器和结构因果模型，生成具有因果关系的反事实金融时间序列数据，用于压力测试和场景分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有市场生成器缺乏因果推理能力，无法进行有效的反事实分析和风险评估。

Method: 使用变分自编码器与结构因果模型结合，在解码器架构中通过有向无环图施加因果约束，并采用因果Wasserstein距离进行训练。

Result: 在基于Ornstein-Uhlenbeck过程的合成自回归模型上验证，反事实概率估计的L1距离低至0.03-0.10，优于基准方法。

Conclusion: 该模型能够生成尊重底层因果机制的反事实市场轨迹，支持金融压力测试、场景分析和改进的回测。

Abstract: Market generators using deep generative models have shown promise for
synthetic financial data generation, but existing approaches lack causal
reasoning capabilities essential for counterfactual analysis and risk
assessment. We propose a Time-series Neural Causal Model VAE (TNCM-VAE) that
combines variational autoencoders with structural causal models to generate
counterfactual financial time series while preserving both temporal
dependencies and causal relationships. Our approach enforces causal constraints
through directed acyclic graphs in the decoder architecture and employs the
causal Wasserstein distance for training. We validate our method on synthetic
autoregressive models inspired by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, demonstrating
superior performance in counterfactual probability estimation with L1 distances
as low as 0.03-0.10 compared to ground truth. The model enables financial
stress testing, scenario analysis, and enhanced backtesting by generating
plausible counterfactual market trajectories that respect underlying causal
mechanisms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Q3R方法，一种基于二次重加权秩正则化的低秩训练策略，能够在保持低秩结构的同时实现与密集模型相当的预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的参数高效训练方法在低秩预训练任务中难以同时保持低秩结构和目标函数，这是一个具有挑战性的问题。

Method: 基于迭代重加权最小二乘框架，提出二次重加权秩正则化器，通过二次正则项来近似平滑对数行列式作为秩代理目标。

Result: 在ViT-Tiny模型上能够裁剪60%和80%的参数，CIFAR-10准确率仅下降约1.3%和4%；在图像和语言任务的Transformer模型上都验证了有效性。

Conclusion: Q3R能够以较小的计算开销训练具有指定低目标秩的权重矩阵，与现有架构完全兼容，在低秩微调中表现出色。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient training, based on low-rank optimization, has become a
highly successful tool for fine-tuning large deep-learning models. However,
these methods fail at low-rank pre-training tasks where maintaining the
low-rank structure and the objective remains a challenging task. We propose the
Quadratic Reweighted Rank Regularizer dubbed Q3R, which leads to a novel
low-rank inducing training strategy inspired by the iteratively reweighted
least squares (IRLS) framework. Q3R is based on a quadratic regularizer term
which majorizes a smoothed log determinant serving as rank surrogate objective.
Unlike other low-rank training techniques, Q3R is able to train weight matrices
with prescribed, low target ranks of models that achieve comparable predictive
performance as dense models, with small computational overhead, while remaining
fully compatible with existing architectures. For example, we demonstrated one
experiment where we are able to truncate $60\%$ and $80\%$ of the parameters of
a ViT-Tiny model with $~1.3\%$ and $~4\%$ accuracy drop in CIFAR-10 performance
respectively. The efficacy of Q3R is confirmed on Transformers across both
image and language tasks, including for low-rank fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种基于数据信息的神经网络压缩方法，通过张量分解和低秩表示来减少网络的计算和内存占用，使用函数空间误差度量而非传统的权重空间范数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络在图像任务中广泛应用但计算需求高，训练后可通过压缩减少内存和计算占用。传统方法在权重空间使用各向同性范数寻找低秩近似，但这种方法不够有效。

Method: 使用数据信息范数测量函数空间误差，最小化层输出分布的变化。提出新的交替最小二乘算法用于Tucker-2和CPD张量分解，直接优化新范数。使用协方差矩阵来定义误差度量。

Result: 数据信息方法通常无需后压缩微调即可达到竞争性精度。协方差范数可在不同数据集间迁移，仅造成轻微精度下降，即使原始训练数据集不可用也能进行压缩。

Conclusion: 在多个CNN架构和数据集上的实验证实了所提方法的优势，提供了一种无需微调且数据集可迁移的高效神经网络压缩方案。

Abstract: Neural networks are widely used for image-related tasks but typically demand
considerable computing power. Once a network has been trained, however, its
memory- and compute-footprint can be reduced by compression. In this work, we
focus on compression through tensorization and low-rank representations.
Whereas classical approaches search for a low-rank approximation by minimizing
an isotropic norm such as the Frobenius norm in weight-space, we use
data-informed norms that measure the error in function space. Concretely, we
minimize the change in the layer's output distribution, which can be expressed
as $\lVert (W - \widetilde{W}) \Sigma^{1/2}\rVert_F$ where $\Sigma^{1/2}$ is
the square root of the covariance matrix of the layer's input and $W$,
$\widetilde{W}$ are the original and compressed weights. We propose new
alternating least square algorithms for the two most common tensor
decompositions (Tucker-2 and CPD) that directly optimize the new norm. Unlike
conventional compression pipelines, which almost always require
post-compression fine-tuning, our data-informed approach often achieves
competitive accuracy without any fine-tuning. We further show that the same
covariance-based norm can be transferred from one dataset to another with only
a minor accuracy drop, enabling compression even when the original training
dataset is unavailable. Experiments on several CNN architectures (ResNet-18/50,
and GoogLeNet) and datasets (ImageNet, FGVC-Aircraft, Cifar10, and Cifar100)
confirm the advantages of the proposed method.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的群体公平性方法，通过最小化加权错误损失并控制假阴性率差异在容忍范围内，来解决算法公平性在刑事司法中的冲突问题，并提供了实用的部署框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 算法公平性研究快速发展，但在刑事司法领域关键概念仍不明确，特别是群体、个体和过程公平性之间的冲突问题需要解决。

Method: 开发了标准群体公平性的简单修改：不追求保护群体间的精确对等，而是最小化加权错误损失，同时将假阴性率差异控制在小的容忍范围内。

Result: 该方法使解决方案更容易找到，可以提高预测准确性，并凸显错误成本的伦理选择。

Conclusion: 提出了基于三个支柱的实用部署框架：基于需求的决策、透明度和问责制、以及精确定义和解决方案，将技术设计与合法性联系起来，为使用风险评估工具的机构提供可操作的指导。

Abstract: Algorithmic fairness has grown rapidly as a research area, yet key concepts
remain unsettled, especially in criminal justice. We review group, individual,
and process fairness and map the conditions under which they conflict. We then
develop a simple modification to standard group fairness. Rather than exact
parity across protected groups, we minimize a weighted error loss while keeping
differences in false negative rates within a small tolerance. This makes
solutions easier to find, can raise predictive accuracy, and surfaces the
ethical choice of error costs. We situate this proposal within three classes of
critique: biased and incomplete data, latent affirmative action, and the
explosion of subgroup constraints. Finally, we offer a practical framework for
deployment in public decision systems built on three pillars: need-based
decisions, Transparency and accountability, and narrowly tailored definitions
and solutions. Together, these elements link technical design to legitimacy and
provide actionable guidance for agencies that use risk assessment and related
tools.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了数据偏移下的线性模式连通性(LMC)现象，发现通过小学习率和大批量大小可以减轻数据偏移的影响，LMC有助于在训练效率和多样化集成模型之间取得平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究数据偏移如何影响线性模式连通性(LMC)，因为LMC与深度学习的多个方面相关，包括训练稳定性、局部最小值的光滑性和泛化能力、模型相似性以及架构对数据处理的影响。

Method: 将数据偏移解释为随机梯度噪声的额外来源，通过实验研究小学习率和大批量大小如何减轻这种影响，分析模型是否收敛到相同局部最小值或具有不同平滑度和泛化能力的区域。

Result: 通过LMC采样的模型倾向于比收敛到不同盆地的模型更频繁地犯类似错误，但LMC的益处在于平衡训练效率与从更大、更多样化集成中获得的好处。

Conclusion: 数据偏移可以通过小学习率和大批量大小来缓解，LMC在训练效率和多样化集成模型之间提供了有效的平衡点。

Abstract: The phenomenon of linear mode connectivity (LMC) links several aspects of
deep learning, including training stability under noisy stochastic gradients,
the smoothness and generalization of local minima (basins), the similarity and
functional diversity of sampled models, and architectural effects on data
processing. In this work, we experimentally study LMC under data shifts and
identify conditions that mitigate their impact. We interpret data shifts as an
additional source of stochastic gradient noise, which can be reduced through
small learning rates and large batch sizes. These parameters influence whether
models converge to the same local minimum or to regions of the loss landscape
with varying smoothness and generalization. Although models sampled via LMC
tend to make similar errors more frequently than those converging to different
basins, the benefit of LMC lies in balancing training efficiency against the
gains achieved from larger, more diverse ensembles. Code and supplementary
materials will be made publicly available at https://github.com/DLR-KI/LMC in
due course.

conditions exactly and employs penalized least squares to estimate the
coefficients. To ensure fairness across paradigms, we introduce a
degrees-of-freedom (DoF) matching protocol. Under matched DoF, B-EPGP
consistently attains lower space-time $L^2$-error and maximum-in-time
$L^{2}$-error in space than CN-FEM, improving accuracy by roughly two orders of
magnitude.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了基于强化学习的Koopman代理模型训练方法，在大型空分装置需求响应案例中验证了该方法可扩展性，相比传统方法在保持经济性能的同时避免约束违反。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前方法仅在小规模案例中验证，需要证明该方法在更具挑战性的大规模工业应用中的可扩展性和有效性。

Method: 使用强化学习训练Koopman代理模型，针对特定经济非线性模型预测控制应用进行优化，仅假设少数实际可测量的工厂变量可观测。

Result: 在大规模氮气空分装置需求响应案例中，该方法相比基于系统辨识的Koopman eNMPC，在保持相似经济性能的同时完全避免了约束违反。

Conclusion: 基于强化学习的Koopman代理模型训练方法具有良好的可扩展性，能够在大规模工业应用中实现经济优化并确保约束满足。

Abstract: With our recently proposed method based on reinforcement learning (Mayfrank
et al. (2024), Comput. Chem. Eng. 190), Koopman surrogate models can be trained
for optimal performance in specific (economic) nonlinear model predictive
control ((e)NMPC) applications. So far, our method has exclusively been
demonstrated on a small-scale case study. Herein, we show that our method
scales well to a more challenging demand response case study built on a
large-scale model of a single-product (nitrogen) air separation unit. Across
all numerical experiments, we assume observability of only a few realistically
measurable plant variables. Compared to a purely system identification-based
Koopman eNMPC, which generates small economic savings but frequently violates
constraints, our method delivers similar economic performance while avoiding
constraint violations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于潜在空间降阶模型的后处理、模型无关的不确定性量化框架，无需修改底层架构或训练过程，使用保形预测方法估计ROM管道中多个组件的统计预测区间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有降阶模型缺乏稳健的不确定性量化方法，且现有方法通常受限于特定架构或训练方式，限制了灵活性和泛化能力。

Method: 使用保形预测方法构建后处理、模型无关的不确定性量化框架，为潜在空间ROM的多个组件（潜在动态、重构和端到端预测）估计统计预测区间。

Result: 在云微物理学的潜在空间动态模型上验证了该方法，能够准确预测液滴尺寸分布的演化，并在整个ROM管道中量化不确定性。

Conclusion: 该方法为潜在空间降阶模型提供了一种灵活、通用的不确定性量化解决方案，无需修改现有模型架构或训练过程。

Abstract: Reduced-order models (ROMs) can efficiently simulate high-dimensional
physical systems, but lack robust uncertainty quantification methods. Existing
approaches are frequently architecture- or training-specific, which limits
flexibility and generalization. We introduce a post hoc, model-agnostic
framework for predictive uncertainty quantification in latent space ROMs that
requires no modification to the underlying architecture or training procedure.
Using conformal prediction, our approach estimates statistical prediction
intervals for multiple components of the ROM pipeline: latent dynamics,
reconstruction, and end-to-end predictions. We demonstrate the method on a
latent space dynamical model for cloud microphysics, where it accurately
predicts the evolution of droplet-size distributions and quantifies uncertainty
across the ROM pipeline.

TL;DR: 提出了Relational Graph Perceiver (RGP)模型，通过时间子图采样器和跨注意力潜在瓶颈，有效整合关系数据中的时空依赖关系，支持多任务预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图模型主要关注空间结构，将时间信息仅作为过滤约束而非建模信号，且通常只支持单任务预测。需要能整合长距离时空依赖并支持多任务的关系深度学习模型。

Method: 1) 时间子图采样器：检索超出直接邻域的节点以捕捉时间相关关系；2) RGP图变换器架构：使用跨注意力潜在瓶颈整合结构与时序信息；3) 灵活跨注意力解码器：支持不相交标签空间的多任务联合学习。

Result: 在RelBench、SALT和CTU数据集上的实验表明，RGP实现了最先进的性能，为关系深度学习提供了通用且可扩展的解决方案。

Conclusion: RGP通过有效整合时空上下文和全局关系系统信息，为多任务关系深度学习提供了强大而灵活的框架。

Abstract: In domains such as healthcare, finance, and e-commerce, the temporal dynamics
of relational data emerge from complex interactions-such as those between
patients and providers, or users and products across diverse categories. To be
broadly useful, models operating on these data must integrate long-range
spatial and temporal dependencies across diverse types of entities, while also
supporting multiple predictive tasks. However, existing graph models for
relational data primarily focus on spatial structure, treating temporal
information merely as a filtering constraint to exclude future events rather
than a modeling signal, and are typically designed for single-task prediction.
To address these gaps, we introduce a temporal subgraph sampler that enhances
global context by retrieving nodes beyond the immediate neighborhood to capture
temporally relevant relationships. In addition, we propose the Relational Graph
Perceiver (RGP), a graph transformer architecture for relational deep learning
that leverages a cross-attention-based latent bottleneck to efficiently
integrate information from both structural and temporal contexts. This latent
bottleneck integrates signals from different node and edge types into a common
latent space, enabling the model to build global context across the entire
relational system. RGP also incorporates a flexible cross-attention decoder
that supports joint learning across tasks with disjoint label spaces within a
single model. Experiments on RelBench, SALT, and CTU show that RGP delivers
state-of-the-art performance, offering a general and scalable solution for
relational deep learning with support for diverse predictive tasks.

TL;DR: ARETE R包是一个利用大型语言模型自动从科学文献中提取物种出现数据的开源工具，能够显著提高数据提取效率并扩展物种分布范围知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保护生物学面临的关键挑战是缺乏物种出现数据，且传统数据提取方法需要大量人工工作，无法应对日益增长的数据处理需求。

Method: 开发ARETE R包，集成光学字符识别、大语言模型数据提取、异常值检测和表格输出等步骤，通过chatGPT API实现自动化数据提取。

Result: 对100种蜘蛛的测试显示，新提取数据使已知分布范围平均扩大了三个数量级，揭示了新的历史分布区域。

Conclusion: ARETE能够快速获取未开发的出现数据，改变依赖此类数据的项目工作流程，让研究人员能更好地分配资源，在项目规划阶段预测可用文献数据。

Abstract: 1. A hard stop for the implementation of rigorous conservation initiatives is
our lack of key species data, especially occurrence data. Furthermore,
researchers have to contend with an accelerated speed at which new information
must be collected and processed due to anthropogenic activity. Publications
ranging from scientific papers to gray literature contain this crucial
information but their data are often not machine-readable, requiring extensive
human work to be retrieved. 2. We present the ARETE R package, an open-source
software aiming to automate data extraction of species occurrences powered by
large language models, namely using the chatGPT Application Programming
Interface. This R package integrates all steps of the data extraction and
validation process, from Optical Character Recognition to detection of outliers
and output in tabular format. Furthermore, we validate ARETE through systematic
comparison between what is modelled and the work of human annotators. 3. We
demonstrate the usefulness of the approach by comparing range maps produced
using GBIF data and with those automatically extracted for 100 species of
spiders. Newly extracted data allowed to expand the known Extent of Occurrence
by a mean three orders of magnitude, revealing new areas where the species were
found in the past, which mayhave important implications for spatial
conservation planning and extinction risk assessments. 4. ARETE allows faster
access to hitherto untapped occurrence data, a potential game changer in
projects requiring such data. Researchers will be able to better prioritize
resources, manually verifying selected species while maintaining automated
extraction for the majority. This workflow also allows predicting available
bibliographic data during project planning.

TL;DR: CAA框架将系统复杂性定义为相对于观察者家族的预测遗憾差异，认为复杂性源于不同观察者建模系统时的难易程度差异，从而创造信息优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统复杂性度量通常关注系统内在属性，而CAA框架旨在从观察者依赖的视角重新定义复杂性，强调复杂性源于不同观察者对系统建模能力的差异。

Method: 通过定义系统相对于观察者家族的预测遗憾来量化复杂性，分析不同观察者建模系统时的难易程度差异，并通过简单动力学模型进行验证。

Result: 该框架统一了多种涌现行为概念（如多尺度熵、预测信息等），表明"有趣"系统是那些能在不同观察者间产生差异化预测遗憾的系统。

Conclusion: CAA为复杂性提供了功能价值基础，表明复杂性可以通过创造观察者间的信息优势而具有实际价值，对学习、进化和智能体设计具有启示意义。

Abstract: We introduce Complexity as Advantage (CAA), a framework that defines the
complexity of a system relative to a family of observers. Instead of measuring
complexity as an intrinsic property, we evaluate how much predictive regret a
system induces for different observers attempting to model it. A system is
complex when it is easy for some observers and hard for others, creating an
information advantage. We show that this formulation unifies several notions of
emergent behavior, including multiscale entropy, predictive information, and
observer-dependent structure. The framework suggests that "interesting" systems
are those positioned to create differentiated regret across observers,
providing a quantitative grounding for why complexity can be functionally
valuable. We demonstrate the idea through simple dynamical models and discuss
implications for learning, evolution, and artificial agents.

Motivation: 多智能体系统在群体机器人和交通路由等应用中至关重要，但去中心化多智能体随机最短路径问题的学习问题尚未得到充分探索，需要填补这一研究空白。

Method: 应用基于对称性的新颖论证方法，识别最优策略的结构，并通过构建难以学习的实例来建立遗憾下界。

Conclusion: 这些发现阐明了去中心化控制的学习复杂性，可为多智能体系统中高效学习算法的设计提供指导。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) are central to applications such as swarm robotics
and traffic routing, where agents must coordinate in a decentralized manner to
achieve a common objective. Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) problems provide a
natural framework for modeling decentralized control in such settings. While
the problem of learning in SSP has been extensively studied in single-agent
settings, the decentralized multi-agent variant remains largely unexplored. In
this work, we take a step towards addressing that gap. We study decentralized
multi-agent SSPs (Dec-MASSPs) under linear function approximation, where the
transition dynamics and costs are represented using linear models. Applying
novel symmetry-based arguments, we identify the structure of optimal policies.
Our main contribution is the first regret lower bound for this setting based on
the construction of hard-to-learn instances for any number of agents, $n$. Our
regret lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{K})$, over $K$ episodes, highlights the
inherent learning difficulty in Dec-MASSPs. These insights clarify the learning
complexity of decentralized control and can further guide the design of
efficient learning algorithms in multi-agent systems.

Method: 将常规RL环境转换为目标条件环境，让智能体自主选择目标进行学习，该方法与底层离策略学习算法无关。

Result: 训练时间与外部引导的RL相当，平均目标成功率提高并稳定，但个体目标性能存在不稳定性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够训练出可被指示寻求环境中任何观察结果的通用智能体，为特定用例提供预训练基础。

Abstract: In this paper we study how transforming regular reinforcement learning
environments into goal-conditioned environments can let agents learn to solve
tasks autonomously and reward-free. We show that an agent can learn to solve
tasks by selecting its own goals in an environment-agnostic way, at training
times comparable to externally guided reinforcement learning. Our method is
independent of the underlying off-policy learning algorithm. Since our method
is environment-agnostic, the agent does not value any goals higher than others,
leading to instability in performance for individual goals. However, in our
experiments, we show that the average goal success rate improves and
stabilizes. An agent trained with this method can be instructed to seek any
observations made in the environment, enabling generic training of agents prior
to specific use cases.

Motivation: 研究因果干预技术是否会导致模型内部表示偏离自然分布，从而影响解释的忠实性。

Method: 首先实证验证常见因果干预技术会导致分布偏移，然后理论分析两类分布差异，最后改进CL损失函数来正则化干预。

Result: 发现因果干预确实会产生分布外表示，存在无害和有害两种分布差异，改进的CL损失能有效减少有害差异。

Conclusion: 这些结果为开发更可靠的可解释性方法指明了方向，强调了在保持解释力的同时减少分布偏移的重要性。

Abstract: A common approach to mechanistic interpretability is to causally manipulate
model representations via targeted interventions in order to understand what
those representations encode. Here we ask whether such interventions create
out-of-distribution (divergent) representations, and whether this raises
concerns about how faithful their resulting explanations are to the target
model in its natural state. First, we demonstrate empirically that common
causal intervention techniques often do shift internal representations away
from the natural distribution of the target model. Then, we provide a
theoretical analysis of two classes of such divergences: `harmless' divergences
that occur in the null-space of the weights and from covariance within
behavioral decision boundaries, and `pernicious' divergences that activate
hidden network pathways and cause dormant behavioral changes. Finally, in an
effort to mitigate the pernicious cases, we modify the Counterfactual Latent
(CL) loss from Grant (2025) that regularizes interventions to remain closer to
the natural distributions, reducing the likelihood of harmful divergences while
preserving the interpretive power of interventions. Together, these results
highlight a path towards more reliable interpretability methods.

Abstract: This paper is concerned with probabilistic techniques for forecasting
dynamical systems described by partial differential equations (such as, for
example, the Navier-Stokes equations). In particular, it is investigating and
comparing various extensions to the flow matching paradigm that reduce the
number of sampling steps. In this regard, it compares direct distillation,
progressive distillation, adversarial diffusion distillation, Wasserstein GANs
and rectified flows. Moreover, experiments are conducted on a set of
challenging systems. In particular, we also address the challenge of directly
predicting 2D slices of large-scale 3D simulations, paving the way for
efficient inflow generation for solvers.

TL;DR: 本文研究了扩散语言模型(MDM)的并行采样能力，通过函数逼近理论精确刻画了采样分布与真实分布之间的期望差异，并给出了基于总相关性和对偶总相关性的采样边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准自回归语言模型的推理过程是顺序的，导致推理时间长、成本高。扩散语言模型(MDM)能够并行采样，但缺乏对其并行采样能力边界的严格理解。

Method: 通过函数逼近理论建立采样分布与真实分布之间差异的精确表征，并基于总相关性和对偶总相关性推导新的上下界，提出新的采样调度策略。

Result: 在自然设置下，可以在O(log n)步内完成采样而不会出现性能损失，其中n是序列总长度。同时证明在没有先验知识的情况下难以达到最优调度。

Conclusion: 扩散语言模型在特定条件下可以实现高效的并行采样，总相关性和对偶总相关性是决定采样效率的关键信息论特性。

Abstract: A major bottleneck of standard auto-regressive large language models is that
their inference process is inherently sequential, resulting in very long and
costly inference times. To circumvent this, practitioners proposed a class of
language models called diffusion language models, of which the masked diffusion
model (MDM) is the most successful. The MDM is able to sample tokens
out-of-order and, ostensibly, many tokens at once and in parallel. However,
there is very limited rigorous understanding of how much parallel sampling
these models can perform without noticeable degradation in their sampling
performance. Prior work of Li and Cai obtained some preliminary bounds, but
these are not tight for many natural classes of distributions. In this work, we
give a new, exact characterization of the expected divergence between the true
distribution and the sampled distribution, for any distribution and any
unmasking schedule for the sampler, showing an elegant connection to the theory
of univariate function approximation.
  By leveraging this connection, we then attain a number of novel lower and
upper bounds for this problem. While the connection to function approximation
in principle gives the optimal unmasking schedule for any distribution, we show
that it is in general impossible to compete with it without strong a priori
knowledge of the distribution, even in seemingly benign settings. However, we
also demonstrate new upper bounds and new sampling schedules in terms of
well-studied information-theoretic properties of the base distribution, namely,
its total correlation and dual total correlation, which show that in some
natural settings, one can sample in $O(log n)$ steps without any visible loss
in performance, where $n$ is the total sequence length.

Result: 模拟结果显示模型剪枝能将通信成本降低40%，同时保持模型性能不变。

Conclusion: 自适应模型剪枝能有效减少联邦学习的通信开销，同时维持模型性能。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) offers new opportunities in machine learning,
particularly in addressing data privacy concerns. In contrast to conventional
event-based federated learning, time-triggered federated learning (TT-Fed), as
a general form of both asynchronous and synchronous FL, clusters users into
different tiers based on fixed time intervals. However, the FL network consists
of a growing number of user devices with limited wireless bandwidth,
consequently magnifying issues such as stragglers and communication overhead.
In this paper, we introduce adaptive model pruning to wireless TT-Fed systems
and study the problem of jointly optimizing the pruning ratio and bandwidth
allocation to minimize the training loss while ensuring minimal learning
latency. To answer this question, we perform convergence analysis on the
gradient l_2 norm of the TT-Fed model based on model pruning. Based on the
obtained convergence upper bound, a joint optimization problem of pruning ratio
and wireless bandwidth is formulated to minimize the model training loss under
a given delay threshold. Then, we derive closed-form solutions for wireless
bandwidth and pruning ratio using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker(KKT) conditions. The
simulation results show that model pruning could reduce the communication cost
by 40% while maintaining the model performance at the same level.

Motivation: 现有方法在极端降水临近预报中存在局限：数值天气预报及其深度学习模拟速度慢且分辨率低；外推法和纯数据驱动模型存在误差累积和过度平滑问题；混合2D雷达方法丢弃了关键的垂直信息。

Method: 开发了三维临近预报框架，学习垂直变化的3D平流场，参数化空间变化的扩散，引入布朗运动启发的随机项表示未解析运动，使用残差分支捕捉小尺度对流启动和微物理变化，以及基于扩散的随机模块估计不确定性。

Conclusion: 通过恢复具有物理一致性的完整3D动力学，为极端降水的熟练和可靠临近预报提供了可扩展且稳健的途径。

Abstract: Extreme precipitation nowcasting demands high spatiotemporal fidelity and
extended lead times, yet existing approaches remain limited. Numerical Weather
Prediction (NWP) and its deep-learning emulations are too slow and coarse for
rapidly evolving convection, while extrapolation and purely data-driven models
suffer from error accumulation and excessive smoothing. Hybrid 2D radar-based
methods discard crucial vertical information, preventing accurate
reconstruction of height-dependent dynamics. We introduce a gray-box, fully
three-dimensional nowcasting framework that directly processes volumetric radar
reflectivity and couples physically constrained neural operators with
datadriven learning. The model learns vertically varying 3D advection fields
under a conservative advection operator, parameterizes spatially varying
diffusion, and introduces a Brownian-motion--inspired stochastic term to
represent unresolved motions. A residual branch captures small-scale convective
initiation and microphysical variability, while a diffusion-based stochastic
module estimates uncertainty. The framework achieves more accurate forecasts up
to three-hour lead time across precipitation regimes and ranked first in 57\%
of cases in a blind evaluation by 160 meteorologists. By restoring full 3D
dynamics with physical consistency, it offers a scalable and robust pathway for
skillful and reliable nowcasting of extreme precipitation.

Conclusion: 这些结果为遗忘建立了原则性的理解，并为分析和改进通用学习算法的信息保留能力奠定了基础。

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in developing general learning algorithms is their
tendency to forget past knowledge when adapting to new data. Addressing this
problem requires a principled understanding of forgetting; yet, despite decades
of study, no unified definition has emerged that provides insights into the
underlying dynamics of learning. We propose an algorithm- and task-agnostic
theory that characterises forgetting as a lack of self-consistency in a
learner's predictive distribution over future experiences, manifesting as a
loss of predictive information. Our theory naturally yields a general measure
of an algorithm's propensity to forget. To validate the theory, we design a
comprehensive set of experiments that span classification, regression,
generative modelling, and reinforcement learning. We empirically demonstrate
how forgetting is present across all learning settings and plays a significant
role in determining learning efficiency. Together, these results establish a
principled understanding of forgetting and lay the foundation for analysing and
improving the information retention capabilities of general learning
algorithms.

Abstract: This study evaluates a 40-item mathematics placement examination administered
to 198 students using a multi-method framework combining Classical Test Theory,
machine learning, and unsupervised clustering. Classical Test Theory analysis
reveals that 55\% of items achieve excellent discrimination ($D \geq 0.40$)
while 30\% demonstrate poor discrimination ($D < 0.20$) requiring replacement.
Question 6 (Graph Interpretation) emerges as the examination's most powerful
discriminator, achieving perfect discrimination ($D = 1.000$), highest ANOVA
F-statistic ($F = 4609.1$), and maximum Random Forest feature importance
(0.206), accounting for 20.6\% of predictive power. Machine learning algorithms
demonstrate exceptional performance, with Random Forest and Gradient Boosting
achieving 97.5\% and 96.0\% cross-validation accuracy. K-means clustering
identifies a natural binary competency structure with a boundary at 42.5\%,
diverging from the institutional threshold of 55\% and suggesting potential
overclassification into remedial categories. The two-cluster solution exhibits
exceptional stability (bootstrap ARI = 0.855) with perfect lower-cluster
purity. Convergent evidence across methods supports specific refinements:
replace poorly discriminating items, implement a two-stage assessment, and
integrate Random Forest predictions with transparency mechanisms. These
findings demonstrate that multi-method integration provides a robust empirical
foundation for evidence-based mathematics placement optimization.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一个紧凑且高度表达性的壳状超材料设计空间，结合高效的GPU均质化管道实现快速评估和逆向设计，能够生成具有广泛机械响应且接近理论极限性能的结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要开发一个既能表达复杂几何形状又计算高效的设计空间，以支持壳状超材料的快速探索和逆向设计，实现特定宏观性能的定制化设计。

Method: 使用少量自由度表示从简单平面到复杂三周期极小曲面的几何形状，开发基于GPU的快速均质化管道（20ms评估结构，0.5s计算有效弹性张量），并实现逆向设计方案。

Result: 生成的结构具有几何多样性和广泛的机械响应，性能达到理论上限的91.86%，与最先进壳状结构相当，并通过增材制造验证了实际可制造性。

Conclusion: 该紧凑设计空间结合快速计算管道为壳状超材料的探索和逆向设计提供了有效工具，生成的优化结构性能优异且具有实际工程应用潜力。

Abstract: We introduce a compact yet highly expressive design space for shellular
metamaterials. By employing only a few dozen degrees of freedom, this design
space represents geometries ranging from simple planar configurations to
complex triply periodic minimal surfaces. Coupled with this representation, we
develop an efficient GPU-based homogenization pipeline that evaluates the
structure in under 20 ms and computes the corresponding effective elastic
tensor in near-real-time (0.5 s). The high speed of this evaluation facilitates
an exhaustive exploration of the design space and supports an inverse-design
scheme that tailors the shellular structure to specific macroscopic target
property. Structures derived through this approach exhibit not only geometric
diversity but also a wide spectrum of mechanical responses, covering a broad
range of material properties. Moreover, they achieve up to 91.86% of
theoretical upper bounds, a level of performance comparable to state-of-the-art
shellular structures with low solid volume. Finally, our prototypes, fabricated
via additive manufacturing, confirm the practical manufacturability of these
designs, underscoring their potential for real-world engineering applications.

TL;DR: DreamGym是一个统一的框架，通过基于推理的经验模型合成多样化经验数据，解决RL训练中昂贵的环境交互、任务多样性不足、奖励信号不可靠等问题，显著提升自主代理的在线强化学习训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决强化学习在大语言模型代理中实际应用的挑战：昂贵的环境交互、有限的任务多样性、不可靠的奖励信号和复杂的基础设施，这些因素阻碍了可扩展经验数据的收集。

Method: 1) 将环境动态提炼为基于推理的经验模型，通过逐步推理获得一致的状态转换和反馈信号；2) 使用离线真实数据初始化经验回放缓冲区并持续丰富；3) 自适应生成挑战当前代理策略的新任务，实现在线课程学习。

Result: 在多样化环境和代理骨干上的实验表明：在非RL就绪任务（如WebArena）上比所有基线方法提升超过30%；在RL就绪但成本高昂的设置中，仅使用合成交互就能达到GRPO和PPO的性能；在纯合成经验训练的策略迁移到真实环境RL时，获得显著额外性能提升且需要更少的真实世界交互。

Conclusion: DreamGym为通用强化学习提供了一个可扩展的预热启动策略，通过合成经验数据有效解决了RL训练中的可扩展性问题。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) can empower large language model (LLM)
agents by enabling self-improvement through interaction, its practical adoption
remains challenging due to costly rollouts, limited task diversity, unreliable
reward signals, and infrastructure complexity, all of which obstruct the
collection of scalable experience data. To address these challenges, we
introduce DreamGym, the first unified framework designed to synthesize diverse
experiences with scalability in mind to enable effective online RL training for
autonomous agents. Rather than relying on expensive real-environment rollouts,
DreamGym distills environment dynamics into a reasoning-based experience model
that derives consistent state transitions and feedback signals through
step-by-step reasoning, enabling scalable agent rollout collection for RL. To
improve the stability and quality of transitions, DreamGym leverages an
experience replay buffer initialized with offline real-world data and
continuously enriched with fresh interactions to actively support agent
training. To improve knowledge acquisition, DreamGym adaptively generates new
tasks that challenge the current agent policy, enabling more effective online
curriculum learning. Experiments across diverse environments and agent
backbones demonstrate that DreamGym substantially improves RL training, both in
fully synthetic settings and in sim-to-real transfer scenarios. On non-RL-ready
tasks like WebArena, DreamGym outperforms all baselines by over 30%. And in
RL-ready but costly settings, it matches GRPO and PPO performance using only
synthetic interactions. When transferring a policy trained purely on synthetic
experiences to real-environment RL, DreamGym yields significant additional
performance gains while requiring far fewer real-world interactions, providing
a scalable warm-start strategy for general-purpose RL.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文评估了NLP分词模型在汇编代码分析中的内在特性，包括词汇量大小、语义覆盖等，并研究其对下游任务（如函数签名预测）的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 汇编代码的分词在代码分析中至关重要，但目前仍是一个未被充分探索的领域。本研究旨在填补这一空白，评估NLP分词模型在汇编代码中的内在特性。

Method: 系统研究多种分词模型，通过内在评估比较分词效率、词汇压缩和表示保真度。使用Llama 3.2、BERT和BART等预训练模型，评估这些分词器在多个性能指标上的有效性。

Result: 初步发现表明分词器选择显著影响下游性能，内在指标只能部分预测外在评估结果。研究揭示了内在分词器特性与实际汇编代码任务效用之间的复杂权衡。

Conclusion: 本研究为优化低层代码分析的分词模型提供了宝贵见解，有助于提升基于自然语言模型的二进制分析工作流程的鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Tokenization is fundamental in assembly code analysis, impacting intrinsic
characteristics like vocabulary size, semantic coverage, and extrinsic
performance in downstream tasks. Despite its significance, tokenization in the
context of assembly code remains an underexplored area. This study aims to
address this gap by evaluating the intrinsic properties of Natural Language
Processing (NLP) tokenization models and parameter choices, such as vocabulary
size. We explore preprocessing customization options and pre-tokenization rules
tailored to the unique characteristics of assembly code. Additionally, we
assess their impact on downstream tasks like function signature prediction -- a
critical problem in binary code analysis.
  To this end, we conduct a thorough study on various tokenization models,
systematically analyzing their efficiency in encoding assembly instructions and
capturing semantic nuances. Through intrinsic evaluations, we compare
tokenizers based on tokenization efficiency, vocabulary compression, and
representational fidelity for assembly code. Using state-of-the-art pre-trained
models such as the decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) Llama 3.2, the
encoder-only transformer BERT, and the encoder-decoder model BART, we evaluate
the effectiveness of these tokenizers across multiple performance metrics.
Preliminary findings indicate that tokenizer choice significantly influences
downstream performance, with intrinsic metrics providing partial but incomplete
predictability of extrinsic evaluation outcomes. These results reveal complex
trade-offs between intrinsic tokenizer properties and their utility in
practical assembly code tasks. Ultimately, this study provides valuable
insights into optimizing tokenization models for low-level code analysis,
contributing to the robustness and scalability of Natural Language Model
(NLM)-based binary analysis workflows.

TL;DR: BehaviorLens框架系统评估了用户行为数据在文本和图像两种模态表示下对多模态大语言模型性能的影响，发现图像表示能显著提升预测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索用户行为数据在文本和图像两种表示形式下，哪种能更有效地提升多模态大语言模型在序列用户行为推理任务中的性能。

Method: 开发BehaviorLens基准测试框架，在6个MLLMs上评估三种数据表示方式：文本段落、散点图和流程图，使用真实购买序列数据集进行测试。

Result: 当数据表示为图像时，MLLMs的下一次购买预测准确率相比等效的文本表示提高了87.5%，且无需额外计算成本。

Conclusion: 图像表示用户行为数据能显著提升多模态大语言模型的推理性能，这为优化MLLMs在序列行为数据分析中的应用提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are reshaping how modern agentic
systems reason over sequential user-behavior data. However, whether textual or
image representations of user behavior data are more effective for maximizing
MLLM performance remains underexplored. We present \texttt{BehaviorLens}, a
systematic benchmarking framework for assessing modality trade-offs in
user-behavior reasoning across six MLLMs by representing transaction data as
(1) a text paragraph, (2) a scatter plot, and (3) a flowchart. Using a
real-world purchase-sequence dataset, we find that when data is represented as
images, MLLMs next-purchase prediction accuracy is improved by 87.5% compared
with an equivalent textual representation without any additional computational
cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM可解释性工具分散且代码密集，需要更易用、整合的解决方案来降低技术门槛。

Method: 使用编排器LLM重新表述用户查询，通过代理路由器分配到专门模块，最后将输出情境化为连贯解释。

Result: 开发了一个可扩展的LLM检查平台，通过对话式工作流程提供强大的可解释性基础。

Conclusion: KnowThyself通过整合现有能力到聊天界面，为LLM可解释性提供了易用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: We develop KnowThyself, an agentic assistant that advances large language
model (LLM) interpretability. Existing tools provide useful insights but remain
fragmented and code-intensive. KnowThyself consolidates these capabilities into
a chat-based interface, where users can upload models, pose natural language
questions, and obtain interactive visualizations with guided explanations. At
its core, an orchestrator LLM first reformulates user queries, an agent router
further directs them to specialized modules, and the outputs are finally
contextualized into coherent explanations. This design lowers technical
barriers and provides an extensible platform for LLM inspection. By embedding
the whole process into a conversational workflow, KnowThyself offers a robust
foundation for accessible LLM interpretability.

### [191] [Extracting Causal Relations in Deep Knowledge Tracing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03948)
*Kevin Hong,Kia Karbasi,Gregory Pottie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文挑战了深度知识追踪(DKT)模型性能源于建模知识组件间双向关系的流行解释，证明DKT的真正优势在于其隐式建模先决条件关系的因果结构能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算教育研究中长期目标是开发可解释的知识追踪模型。DKT作为传统方法的重大进展，其性能提升原因存在争议，需要澄清其真正工作机制。

Method: 通过将练习关系图修剪为有向无环图(DAG)，在Assistments数据集的因果子集上训练DKT，并使用DKT学习表示提取练习关系DAG的替代方法。

Result: 实验表明DKT的预测能力与因果结构高度一致，其学习表示能有效提取练习关系DAG，支持DKT通过近似知识组件间因果依赖而非简单关系映射发挥作用的观点。

Conclusion: DKT的有效性主要源于其建模知识组件间因果依赖关系的能力，而非先前认为的双向关系建模，这为理解深度学习在教育领域的应用提供了新视角。

Abstract: A longstanding goal in computational educational research is to develop
explainable knowledge tracing (KT) models. Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), which
leverages a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict student knowledge and
performance on exercises, has been proposed as a major advancement over
traditional KT methods. Several studies suggest that its performance gains stem
from its ability to model bidirectional relationships between different
knowledge components (KCs) within a course, enabling the inference of a
student's understanding of one KC from their performance on others. In this
paper, we challenge this prevailing explanation and demonstrate that DKT's
strength lies in its implicit ability to model prerequisite relationships as a
causal structure, rather than bidirectional relationships. By pruning exercise
relation graphs into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and training DKT on causal
subsets of the Assistments dataset, we show that DKT's predictive capabilities
align strongly with these causal structures. Furthermore, we propose an
alternative method for extracting exercise relation DAGs using DKT's learned
representations and provide empirical evidence supporting our claim. Our
findings suggest that DKT's effectiveness is largely driven by its capacity to
approximate causal dependencies between KCs rather than simple relational
mappings.

### [192] [LLMs and Cultural Values: the Impact of Prompt Language and Explicit Cultural Framing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03980)
*Bram Bulté,Ayla Rigouts Terryn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs对提示语言和文化框架敏感，但存在系统性偏见，偏向荷兰、德国、美国和日本的文化价值观，无法充分代表文化多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs是否能代表其广泛用户群体的文化多样性，探讨提示语言和文化框架如何影响模型响应与不同国家人类价值观的匹配程度。

Method: 使用10个LLMs测试63个来自霍夫斯泰德价值观调查模块和世界价值观调查的项目，翻译成11种语言，采用有无明确文化视角的提示方式。

Result: 提示语言和文化视角都会导致LLM输出变化，但模型系统性偏向荷兰、德国、美国和日本价值观。明确文化视角比针对性提示语言更能改善与人类受访者文化价值观的匹配度。

Conclusion: LLMs处于尴尬的中间地带：对提示变化足够敏感以产生差异，但又过于固守特定文化默认值而无法充分代表文化多样性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted by users across the
globe, who interact with them in a diverse range of languages. At the same
time, there are well-documented imbalances in the training data and
optimisation objectives of this technology, raising doubts as to whether LLMs
can represent the cultural diversity of their broad user base. In this study,
we look at LLMs and cultural values and examine how prompt language and
cultural framing influence model responses and their alignment with human
values in different countries. We probe 10 LLMs with 63 items from the Hofstede
Values Survey Module and World Values Survey, translated into 11 languages, and
formulated as prompts with and without different explicit cultural
perspectives. Our study confirms that both prompt language and cultural
perspective produce variation in LLM outputs, but with an important caveat:
While targeted prompting can, to a certain extent, steer LLM responses in the
direction of the predominant values of the corresponding countries, it does not
overcome the models' systematic bias toward the values associated with a
restricted set of countries in our dataset: the Netherlands, Germany, the US,
and Japan. All tested models, regardless of their origin, exhibit remarkably
similar patterns: They produce fairly neutral responses on most topics, with
selective progressive stances on issues such as social tolerance. Alignment
with cultural values of human respondents is improved more with an explicit
cultural perspective than with a targeted prompt language. Unexpectedly,
combining both approaches is no more effective than cultural framing with an
English prompt. These findings reveal that LLMs occupy an uncomfortable middle
ground: They are responsive enough to changes in prompts to produce variation,
but too firmly anchored to specific cultural defaults to adequately represent
cultural diversity.

TL;DR: ArchPilot是一个多代理系统，通过集成架构生成、基于代理的评估和自适应搜索来解决LLM代理在自动化ML工程中计算开销大、可扩展性差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于LLM的代理在自动化ML工程中严重依赖重复的完整训练运行来评估候选方案，导致计算开销大、搜索空间扩展性差、迭代周期慢。

Method: 采用三代理协作框架：编排代理使用MCTS启发算法协调搜索过程；生成代理迭代生成、改进和调试候选架构；评估代理执行代理训练运行并生成优化的代理函数。

Result: 在MLE-Bench上的实验表明，ArchPilot优于AIDE和ML-Master等最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: ArchPilot的多代理协作能够在有限预算下优先考虑高潜力候选方案，最小化对昂贵完整训练运行的依赖，实现高效的ML工程。

Abstract: Recent LLM-based agents have demonstrated strong capabilities in automated ML
engineering. However, they heavily rely on repeated full training runs to
evaluate candidate solutions, resulting in significant computational overhead,
limited scalability to large search spaces, and slow iteration cycles. To
address these challenges, we introduce ArchPilot, a multi-agent system that
integrates architecture generation, proxy-based evaluation, and adaptive search
into a unified framework. ArchPilot consists of three specialized agents: an
orchestration agent that coordinates the search process using a Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS)-inspired novel algorithm with a restart mechanism and
manages memory of previous candidates; a generation agent that iteratively
generates, improves, and debugs candidate architectures; and an evaluation
agent that executes proxy training runs, generates and optimizes proxy
functions, and aggregates the proxy scores into a fidelity-aware performance
metric. This multi-agent collaboration allows ArchPilot to prioritize
high-potential candidates with minimal reliance on expensive full training
runs, facilitating efficient ML engineering under limited budgets. Experiments
on MLE-Bench demonstrate that ArchPilot outperforms SOTA baselines such as AIDE
and ML-Master, validating the effectiveness of our multi-agent system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体AI系统具有非确定性，容易出现漂移、循环和输出细节缺失等难以检测的静默故障。

Method: 开发了数据集构建流程，捕捉用户行为、智能体非确定性和LLM变异，并创建了两个基准数据集。使用XGBoost和SVDD方法进行异常检测。

Result: 监督方法(XGBoost)准确率达98%，半监督方法(SVDD)准确率达96%。

Conclusion: 这是首个系统研究多智能体AI系统中异常检测的工作，提供了数据集、基准和见解，指导未来研究。

Abstract: Multi-Agentic AI systems, powered by large language models (LLMs), are
inherently non-deterministic and prone to silent failures such as drift,
cycles, and missing details in outputs, which are difficult to detect. We
introduce the task of anomaly detection in agentic trajectories to identify
these failures and present a dataset curation pipeline that captures user
behavior, agent non-determinism, and LLM variation. Using this pipeline, we
curate and label two benchmark datasets comprising \textbf{4,275 and 894}
trajectories from Multi-Agentic AI systems. Benchmarking anomaly detection
methods on these datasets, we show that supervised (XGBoost) and
semi-supervised (SVDD) approaches perform comparably, achieving accuracies up
to 98% and 96%, respectively. This work provides the first systematic study of
anomaly detection in Multi-Agentic AI systems, offering datasets, benchmarks,
and insights to guide future research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs在数值推理中存在系统错误，研究发现它们编码了真实世界的数值相关性但会放大这些相关性，无关的数值上下文会引发表示偏移，影响下游决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管行为研究已记录LLMs在数值推理中的错误，但其底层表示机制尚不清楚。研究旨在探索LLMs如何内部整合实体的多个数值属性，以及无关数值上下文如何干扰这些表示和输出。

Method: 结合线性探测与偏相关分析，以及基于提示的脆弱性测试，在不同规模的模型上进行实验。

Result: LLMs编码了真实世界的数值相关性但倾向于系统性地放大它们；无关上下文会在量级表示中引发一致的偏移，且下游影响随模型规模变化。

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了LLM决策中的脆弱性，为在多属性纠缠下实现更公平、表示感知的控制奠定了基础。

Abstract: Although behavioral studies have documented numerical reasoning errors in
large language models (LLMs), the underlying representational mechanisms remain
unclear. We hypothesize that numerical attributes occupy shared latent
subspaces and investigate two questions:(1) How do LLMs internally integrate
multiple numerical attributes of a single entity? (2)How does irrelevant
numerical context perturb these representations and their downstream outputs?
To address these questions, we combine linear probing with partial correlation
analysis and prompt-based vulnerability tests across models of varying sizes.
Our results show that LLMs encode real-world numerical correlations but tend to
systematically amplify them. Moreover, irrelevant context induces consistent
shifts in magnitude representations, with downstream effects that vary by model
size. These findings reveal a vulnerability in LLM decision-making and lay the
groundwork for fairer, representation-aware control under multi-attribute
entanglement.

*Hao Li,Haotian Chen,Ruoyuan Gong,Juanjuan Wang,Hao Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Agentmandering框架，将选区重划重新构想为两个代表对立政治利益的智能体之间的回合制谈判，通过LLM智能体将战略互动嵌入选区重划过程，显著减少了党派偏见和不公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有计算方法主要生成大量合法选区重划方案，但忽视了选择过程中的战略动态，这为党派行为者挑选技术上合规但政治上有利的地图创造了机会。仅仅满足形式约束并不能确保公平性。

Method: 基于博弈论思想，特别是"选择并冻结"协议，让代表对立政治利益的LLM智能体轮流从少量候选地图中选择和冻结选区，通过受约束且可解释的选择逐步划分州。

Result: 在2020年美国人口普查数据上的评估显示，Agentmandering显著减少了党派偏见和不公平性，同时实现了比标准基线低2到3个数量级的方差，特别是在摇摆州场景中表现出公平性和稳定性。

Conclusion: Agentmandering框架通过将战略互动嵌入选区重划过程，能够有效减少党派偏见，提高公平性和稳定性，为选区重划提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Redistricting plays a central role in shaping how votes are translated into
political power. While existing computational methods primarily aim to generate
large ensembles of legally valid districting plans, they often neglect the
strategic dynamics involved in the selection process. This oversight creates
opportunities for partisan actors to cherry-pick maps that, while technically
compliant, are politically advantageous. Simply satisfying formal constraints
does not ensure fairness when the selection process itself can be manipulated.
We propose \textbf{Agentmandering}, a framework that reimagines redistricting
as a turn-based negotiation between two agents representing opposing political
interests. Drawing inspiration from game-theoretic ideas, particularly the
\textit{Choose-and-Freeze} protocol, our method embeds strategic interaction
into the redistricting process via large language model (LLM) agents. Agents
alternate between selecting and freezing districts from a small set of
candidate maps, gradually partitioning the state through constrained and
interpretable choices. Evaluation on post-2020 U.S. Census data across all
states shows that Agentmandering significantly reduces partisan bias and
unfairness, while achieving 2 to 3 orders of magnitude lower variance than
standard baselines. These results demonstrate both fairness and stability,
especially in swing-state scenarios. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了LLM-KGFR协作框架，结合大语言模型和知识图谱基础检索器，解决大语言模型在知识密集型问题上的局限性，实现零样本泛化到未见过的知识图谱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在推理方面表现出色，但在知识密集型问题上受限于有限的上下文和参数知识。现有方法依赖微调的大语言模型或图神经网络检索器，存在数据集特定调整和在大型或未见图谱上可扩展性差的问题。

Method: LLM-KGFR框架中，大语言模型与结构化检索器KGFR协作。KGFR使用大语言模型生成的关系描述编码关系，并根据实体在问题中的角色初始化实体。采用非对称渐进传播(APP)策略逐步扩展，选择性限制高度节点同时保留信息路径。通过节点、边和路径级接口，大语言模型迭代请求候选答案、支持事实和推理路径。

Result: 实验表明LLM-KGFR在保持可扩展性和泛化能力的同时实现了强大的性能，为知识图谱增强推理提供了实用解决方案。

Conclusion: LLM-KGFR框架通过大语言模型与结构化检索器的协作，有效解决了知识密集型推理问题，具备零样本泛化能力和良好的可扩展性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning but struggle with
knowledge-intensive questions due to limited context and parametric knowledge.
However, existing methods that rely on finetuned LLMs or GNN retrievers are
limited by dataset-specific tuning and scalability on large or unseen graphs.
We propose the LLM-KGFR collaborative framework, where an LLM works with a
structured retriever, the Knowledge Graph Foundation Retriever (KGFR). KGFR
encodes relations using LLM-generated descriptions and initializes entities
based on their roles in the question, enabling zero-shot generalization to
unseen KGs. To handle large graphs efficiently, it employs Asymmetric
Progressive Propagation (APP)- a stepwise expansion that selectively limits
high-degree nodes while retaining informative paths. Through node-, edge-, and
path-level interfaces, the LLM iteratively requests candidate answers,
supporting facts, and reasoning paths, forming a controllable reasoning loop.
Experiments demonstrate that LLM-KGFR achieves strong performance while
maintaining scalability and generalization, providing a practical solution for
KG-augmented reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了首个系统化框架来评估语音AI测试质量，通过人类中心化基准测试方法，结合心理测量技术和统计验证，为语音AI测试平台提供可复现的质量指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音AI代理正在快速部署到生产环境，但缺乏系统化的测试可靠性验证方法。组织无法客观评估其测试方法是否有效，随着语音AI扩展到数十亿日常交互，这造成了关键的测量差距。

Method: 采用人类中心化基准测试框架，结合心理测量技术（成对比较产生Elo评分、自助法置信区间和置换检验）与严格的统计验证，评估测试平台的两个核心能力：生成真实测试对话（模拟质量）和准确评估代理响应（评估质量）。

Result: 对三个领先商业平台进行了全面实证评估，收集了21,600个人类判断。结果显示显著的性能差异，表现最佳的平台Evalion在评估质量（f1-score）上达到0.92，其他平台为0.73；在模拟质量（联赛评分系统）上达到0.61，其他平台为0.43。

Conclusion: 该框架使研究人员和组织能够实证验证任何平台的测试能力，为大规模语音AI部署提供了必要的测量基础，支持材料已提供以促进复现和采用。

Abstract: Voice AI agents are rapidly transitioning to production deployments, yet
systematic methods for ensuring testing reliability remain underdeveloped.
Organizations cannot objectively assess whether their testing approaches
(internal tools or external platforms) actually work, creating a critical
measurement gap as voice AI scales to billions of daily interactions.
  We present the first systematic framework for evaluating voice AI testing
quality through human-centered benchmarking. Our methodology addresses the
fundamental dual challenge of testing platforms: generating realistic test
conversations (simulation quality) and accurately evaluating agent responses
(evaluation quality). The framework combines established psychometric
techniques (pairwise comparisons yielding Elo ratings, bootstrap confidence
intervals, and permutation tests) with rigorous statistical validation to
provide reproducible metrics applicable to any testing approach.
  To validate the framework and demonstrate its utility, we conducted
comprehensive empirical evaluation of three leading commercial platforms
focused on Voice AI Testing using 21,600 human judgments across 45 simulations
and ground truth validation on 60 conversations. Results reveal statistically
significant performance differences with the proposed framework, with the
top-performing platform, Evalion, achieving 0.92 evaluation quality measured as
f1-score versus 0.73 for others, and 0.61 simulation quality using a league
based scoring system (including ties) vs 0.43 for other platforms.
  This framework enables researchers and organizations to empirically validate
the testing capabilities of any platform, providing essential measurement
foundations for confident voice AI deployment at scale. Supporting materials
are made available to facilitate reproducibility and adoption.

Motivation: 赋能作为AI代理的通用目标无关目标已被提出，但先前研究假设代理在孤立环境中辅助单个人类。多人环境如家庭和医院是AI辅助的有前景场景，需要研究赋能目标在这些环境中的表现。

Method: 引入开源多人网格世界测试套件Disempower-Grid，通过实验展示优化单个人类赋能的辅助RL代理如何影响其他人的环境影响力和奖励。

Result: 实验表明，优化单个人类赋能的代理会显著减少其他人的环境影响力和奖励，即产生去赋能现象。联合赋能可以缓解去赋能，但会以用户奖励为代价。

Conclusion: AI对齐社区面临更广泛挑战：在单智能体环境中看似对齐的目标无关目标，在多智能体环境中可能变得不对齐。

Abstract: Empowerment, a measure of an agent's ability to control its environment, has
been proposed as a universal goal-agnostic objective for motivating assistive
behavior in AI agents. While multi-human settings like homes and hospitals are
promising for AI assistance, prior work on empowerment-based assistance assumes
that the agent assists one human in isolation. We introduce an open source
multi-human gridworld test suite Disempower-Grid. Using Disempower-Grid, we
empirically show that assistive RL agents optimizing for one human's
empowerment can significantly reduce another human's environmental influence
and rewards - a phenomenon we formalize as disempowerment. We characterize when
disempowerment occurs in these environments and show that joint empowerment
mitigates disempowerment at the cost of the user's reward. Our work reveals a
broader challenge for the AI alignment community: goal-agnostic objectives that
seem aligned in single-agent settings can become misaligned in multi-agent
contexts.

TL;DR: Opus工作流评估框架是一个概率-规范化的数学模型，用于量化工作流质量和效率，结合了正确性、可靠性和成本，支持工作流的比较、评分和优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要一种系统化的方法来评估和优化工作流的质量和效率，特别是在现代自动化系统中，需要综合考虑工作流的成功概率、资源使用和输出收益。

Method: 结合Opus工作流奖励（概率函数估计预期性能）和Opus工作流规范惩罚（测量结构性和信息质量），形成一个统一的优化公式，支持自动化评估和强化学习指导的工作流发现与优化。

Result: 提出了一个统一的框架，能够直接比较、评分和优化工作流，支持在自动化系统中进行工作流评估、排名和优化。

Conclusion: Opus工作流评估框架为工作流的质量和效率提供了量化方法，能够通过奖励和惩罚的权衡来识别和排名最优工作流，适用于现代自动化系统的集成和优化。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Opus Workflow Evaluation Framework, a
probabilistic-normative formulation for quantifying Workflow quality and
efficiency. It integrates notions of correctness, reliability, and cost into a
coherent mathematical model that enables direct comparison, scoring, and
optimization of Workflows. The framework combines the Opus Workflow Reward, a
probabilistic function estimating expected performance through success
likelihood, resource usage, and output gain, with the Opus Workflow Normative
Penalties, a set of measurable functions capturing structural and informational
quality across Cohesion, Coupling, Observability, and Information Hygiene. It
supports automated Workflow assessment, ranking, and optimization within modern
automation systems such as Opus and can be integrated into Reinforcement
Learning loops to guide Workflow discovery and refinement. In this paper, we
introduce the Opus Workflow Reward model that formalizes Workflow success as a
probabilistic expectation over costs and outcomes. We define measurable Opus
Workflow Normative Penalties capturing structural, semantic, and signal-related
properties of Workflows. Finally, we propose a unified optimization formulation
for identifying and ranking optimal Workflows under joint Reward-Penalty
trade-offs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出多智能体预测编码框架，通过最小化智能体间互不确定性来解决协调问题，在带宽受限条件下实现高效通信和社会表征学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统中部分可观测性和有限带宽常导致协调失败，需要开发能够自适应通信的协调机制。

Method: 基于信息瓶颈目标，让智能体学习何时、与谁、通信什么；通过自监督运动预测产生网格细胞状空间编码；构建层次强化学习策略主动探索减少联合不确定性。

Result: 在Memory-Maze基准测试中，方法在带宽从128位/步降至4位/步时，成功率从73.5%优雅降至64.4%，而全广播基线从67.6%崩溃至28.6%。

Conclusion: 建立了一个理论原则和生物学上合理的基础，说明复杂社会表征如何从统一的预测驱动中涌现，实现社会集体智能。

Abstract: Sharing and reconstructing a consistent spatial memory is a critical
challenge in multi-agent systems, where partial observability and limited
bandwidth often lead to catastrophic failures in coordination. We introduce a
multi-agent predictive coding framework that formulate coordination as the
minimization of mutual uncertainty among agents. Instantiated as an information
bottleneck objective, it prompts agents to learn not only who and what to
communicate but also when. At the foundation of this framework lies a
grid-cell-like metric as internal spatial coding for self-localization,
emerging spontaneously from self-supervised motion prediction. Building upon
this internal spatial code, agents gradually develop a bandwidth-efficient
communication mechanism and specialized neural populations that encode
partners' locations: an artificial analogue of hippocampal social place cells
(SPCs). These social representations are further enacted by a hierarchical
reinforcement learning policy that actively explores to reduce joint
uncertainty. On the Memory-Maze benchmark, our approach shows exceptional
resilience to bandwidth constraints: success degrades gracefully from 73.5% to
64.4% as bandwidth shrinks from 128 to 4 bits/step, whereas a full-broadcast
baseline collapses from 67.6% to 28.6%. Our findings establish a theoretically
principled and biologically plausible basis for how complex social
representations emerge from a unified predictive drive, leading to social
collective intelligence.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLVR训练中存在RL过拟合问题，模型获得训练奖励但失去泛化能力。RLoop框架通过迭代策略初始化，将训练过程转化为探索-利用循环，有效提升泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决强化学习在可验证奖励训练中的过拟合问题，防止模型在获得训练奖励的同时失去泛化能力。

Method: 提出RLoop框架，通过迭代策略初始化：先用RL从给定策略探索解空间，过滤成功轨迹创建专家数据集，然后通过拒绝采样微调(RFT)优化初始策略，为下一轮迭代提供更好的起点。

Result: RLoop显著缓解遗忘问题并大幅提升泛化能力，相比原始RL平均准确率提升9%，pass@32指标提升超过15%。

Conclusion: RLoop通过将瞬时策略变化转化为稳健性能增益，有效解决了RL训练中的过拟合和泛化问题。

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning for Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is powerful for
training large reasoning models, its training dynamics harbor a critical
challenge: RL overfitting, where models gain training rewards but lose
generalization. Our analysis reveals this is driven by policy
over-specialization and catastrophic forgetting of diverse solutions generated
during training. Standard optimization discards this valuable inter-step policy
diversity. To address this, we introduce RLoop, a self-improving framework
built on iterative policy initialization. RLoop transforms the standard
training process into a virtuous cycle: it first uses RL to explore the
solution space from a given policy, then filters the successful trajectories to
create an expert dataset. This dataset is used via Rejection-sampling
Fine-Tuning (RFT) to refine the initial policy, creating a superior starting
point for the next iteration. This loop of exploration and exploitation via
iterative re-initialization effectively converts transient policy variations
into robust performance gains. Our experiments show RLoop mitigates forgetting
and substantially improves generalization, boosting average accuracy by 9% and
pass@32 by over 15% compared to vanilla RL.

TL;DR: GUI-360°是一个大规模数据集和基准套件，用于推进计算机使用代理（CUAs）的研究，包含120万+执行动作步骤，支持GUI定位、屏幕解析和动作预测三个核心任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决计算机使用代理研究中的三个关键挑战：真实CUA任务稀缺、多模态轨迹自动收集标注流程缺乏、以及缺乏统一评估GUI定位、屏幕解析和动作预测的基准。

Method: 采用LLM增强的自动化流程，包括查询来源、环境模板构建、任务实例化、批量执行和LLM驱动的质量过滤，在Windows办公应用中收集数千条轨迹数据。

Result: 基准测试显示现有视觉语言模型在GUI定位和动作预测方面存在显著不足，监督微调和强化学习虽有改善但未达到人类可靠性水平。

Conclusion: GUI-360°数据集和代码已公开，旨在促进可重复研究并加速稳健桌面CUAs的发展。

Abstract: We introduce GUI-360$^\circ$, a large-scale, comprehensive dataset and
benchmark suite designed to advance computer-using agents (CUAs). CUAs present
unique challenges and is constrained by three persistent gaps: a scarcity of
real-world CUA tasks, the lack of automated collection-and-annotation pipelines
for multi-modal trajectories, and the absence of a unified benchmark that
jointly evaluates GUI grounding, screen parsing, and action prediction.
  GUI-360$^\circ$ addresses these gaps with an LLM-augmented, largely automated
pipeline for query sourcing, environment-template construction, task
instantiation, batched execution, and LLM-driven quality filtering. The
released corpus contains over 1.2M executed action steps across thousands of
trajectories in popular Windows office applications, and includes
full-resolution screenshots, accessibility metadata when available,
instantiated goals, intermediate reasoning traces, and both successful and
failed action trajectories. The dataset supports three canonical tasks, GUI
grounding, screen parsing, and action prediction, and a hybrid GUI+API action
space that reflects modern agent designs. Benchmarking state-of-the-art
vision--language models on GUI-360$^\circ$ reveals substantial out-of-the-box
shortcomings in grounding and action prediction; supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning yield significant gains but do not close the gap to
human-level reliability. We release GUI-360$^\circ$ and accompanying code to
facilitate reproducible research and accelerate progress on robust desktop
CUAs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文指出CAV探针的分类准确性不能可靠衡量概念对齐度，提出了基于空间线性归因的新概念定位方法，并引入三类定量评估概念对齐的指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前可解释AI中，CAV通常通过训练线性分类器探针来检测概念，但高探针准确率并不能保证CAV真实反映目标概念，探针更可能捕捉虚假相关性而非仅代表目标概念。

Method: 提出基于空间线性归因的概念定位方法，与现有特征可视化技术进行比较，并引入三类评估指标：硬准确率、分割分数和增强鲁棒性。

Result: 研究表明具有平移不变性和空间对齐的探针能持续提高概念对齐度，故意构造的错位探针也能达到接近标准探针的准确率。

Conclusion: 需要基于对齐度的评估指标而非探针准确率，探针设计应考虑模型架构和目标概念性质。

Abstract: In explainable AI, Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) are typically obtained
by training linear classifier probes to detect human-understandable concepts as
directions in the activation space of deep neural networks. It is widely
assumed that a high probe accuracy indicates a CAV faithfully representing its
target concept. However, we show that the probe's classification accuracy alone
is an unreliable measure of concept alignment, i.e., the degree to which a CAV
captures the intended concept. In fact, we argue that probes are more likely to
capture spurious correlations than they are to represent only the intended
concept. As part of our analysis, we demonstrate that deliberately misaligned
probes constructed to exploit spurious correlations, achieve an accuracy close
to that of standard probes. To address this severe problem, we introduce a
novel concept localization method based on spatial linear attribution, and
provide a comprehensive comparison of it to existing feature visualization
techniques for detecting and mitigating concept misalignment. We further
propose three classes of metrics for quantitatively assessing concept
alignment: hard accuracy, segmentation scores, and augmentation robustness. Our
analysis shows that probes with translation invariance and spatial alignment
consistently increase concept alignment. These findings highlight the need for
alignment-based evaluation metrics rather than probe accuracy, and the
importance of tailoring probes to both the model architecture and the nature of
the target concept.

Motivation: 当前LLM安全和鲁棒性研究生态系统碎片化严重，存在大量buggy的实现、数据集和评估方法，导致研究难以复现和比较，阻碍了该领域的实质性进展。

Method: 设计了一个以可复现性、正确性和可扩展性为核心的框架，实现了12种对抗攻击算法，集成了7个基准数据集（涵盖危害性、过度拒绝和效用评估），并通过Hugging Face提供对多种开源LLM的访问。

Conclusion: AdversariaLLM通过提供统一的框架和工具，旨在促进LLM安全研究的透明性、可比较性和可复现性，为该领域的健康发展奠定坚实基础。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of research on Large Language Model (LLM) safety and
robustness has produced a fragmented and oftentimes buggy ecosystem of
implementations, datasets, and evaluation methods. This fragmentation makes
reproducibility and comparability across studies challenging, hindering
meaningful progress. To address these issues, we introduce AdversariaLLM, a
toolbox for conducting LLM jailbreak robustness research. Its design centers on
reproducibility, correctness, and extensibility. The framework implements
twelve adversarial attack algorithms, integrates seven benchmark datasets
spanning harmfulness, over-refusal, and utility evaluation, and provides access
to a wide range of open-weight LLMs via Hugging Face. The implementation
includes advanced features for comparability and reproducibility such as
compute-resource tracking, deterministic results, and distributional evaluation
techniques. \name also integrates judging through the companion package
JudgeZoo, which can also be used independently. Together, these components aim
to establish a robust foundation for transparent, comparable, and reproducible
research in LLM safety.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏真实世界数据集和隐私限制，LLMs在药物安全性方面的研究有限，需要系统评估LLMs在临床咨询环境中的药物安全能力。

Method: 构建了包含6725条禁忌症、28781条药物相互作用和14906条适应症-药物对的RxRisk DB数据库，采用两阶段过滤策略确保临床真实性和专业性，通过结构化多选题评估LLMs推荐安全药物的能力。

Result: 当前LLMs难以整合禁忌症和药物相互作用知识，特别是当风险是隐含而非明确时表现更差。

Conclusion: RxSafeBench是首个评估LLMs药物安全性的综合基准，为改进AI驱动的临床决策支持系统的可靠性提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Numerous medical systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have
achieved remarkable progress in diverse healthcare tasks. However, research on
their medication safety remains limited due to the lack of real world datasets,
constrained by privacy and accessibility issues. Moreover, evaluation of LLMs
in realistic clinical consultation settings, particularly regarding medication
safety, is still underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose a framework
that simulates and evaluates clinical consultations to systematically assess
the medication safety capabilities of LLMs. Within this framework, we generate
inquiry diagnosis dialogues with embedded medication risks and construct a
dedicated medication safety database, RxRisk DB, containing 6,725
contraindications, 28,781 drug interactions, and 14,906 indication-drug pairs.
A two-stage filtering strategy ensures clinical realism and professional
quality, resulting in the benchmark RxSafeBench with 2,443 high-quality
consultation scenarios. We evaluate leading open-source and proprietary LLMs
using structured multiple choice questions that test their ability to recommend
safe medications under simulated patient contexts. Results show that current
LLMs struggle to integrate contraindication and interaction knowledge,
especially when risks are implied rather than explicit. Our findings highlight
key challenges in ensuring medication safety in LLM-based systems and provide
insights into improving reliability through better prompting and task-specific
tuning. RxSafeBench offers the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
medication safety in LLMs, advancing safer and more trustworthy AI-driven
clinical decision support.

*Nick Oh,Fernand Gobet*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了Monitor-Generate-Verify（MGV）框架，通过在Generate-Verify范式前添加显式监控组件来解决模型早期陷入次优推理路径的问题，这是对元认知理论的首次系统性计算转化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时推理架构缺少监控过程，导致模型容易陷入前缀主导陷阱（prefix dominance trap），即过早承诺次优推理路径且难以恢复，造成约20%的准确率损失。

Method: 将Flavell以及Nelson和Narens的元认知理论形式化为计算规范，提出MGV框架，在生成前添加显式监控来捕捉元认知体验（如难度评估和置信度判断），并通过验证反馈来优化未来监控。

Result: 虽然未提供实证验证，但该工作为理解推理系统失败提供了原则性词汇，并为未来测试时推理设计提出了具体的架构干预建议。

Conclusion: MGV框架通过整合元认知监控机制，为解决推理系统中的前缀主导陷阱提供了理论基础和架构指导，是元认知理论在计算领域的首次系统性转化。

Abstract: Test-time reasoning architectures such as those following the Generate-Verify
paradigm -- where a model iteratively refines or verifies its own generated
outputs -- prioritise generation and verification but exclude the monitoring
processes that determine when and how reasoning should begin. This omission may
contribute to the prefix dominance trap, in which models commit early to
suboptimal reasoning paths and seldom recover, yielding roughly 20% accuracy
loss. We address this architectural gap by formalising Flavell's and Nelson and
Narens' metacognitive theories into computational specifications, proposing the
Monitor-Generate-Verify (MGV) framework. MGV extends the Generate-Verify
paradigm by adding explicit monitoring that captures metacognitive experiences
(from difficulty assessments to confidence judgements) before generation begins
and refines future monitoring through verification feedback. Though we present
no empirical validation, this work provides the first systematic computational
translation of foundational metacognitive theories, offering a principled
vocabulary for understanding reasoning system failures and suggesting specific
architectural interventions for future test-time reasoning designs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为迭代后悔最小化微调（Iterative RMFT）的后训练方法，通过反复将低后悔决策轨迹蒸馏回基础模型来增强LLMs的决策能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs原本并非为决策设计，在基础在线决策问题中表现不佳，难以实现低后悔或有效的探索-利用权衡。

Method: 在每次迭代中，模型生成多个决策轨迹，选择k个最低后悔的轨迹，并在这些轨迹上微调自身。该方法利用后悔指标来激发模型自身的决策能力和推理原理。

Result: Iterative RMFT提高了LLMs在各种模型中的决策性能，从具有数值输入/输出的Transformer到开源LLMs，再到GPT-4o mini等先进闭源模型。

Conclusion: Iterative RMFT提供了一个原则性和通用的后训练框架，用于增强LLMs的决策能力，其输出和推理格式的灵活性使其能够泛化到具有不同视野、动作空间、奖励过程和自然语言上下文的任务。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as "agents" for
decision-making (DM) in interactive and dynamic environments. Yet, since they
were not originally designed for DM, recent studies show that LLMs can struggle
even in basic online DM problems, failing to achieve low regret or an effective
exploration-exploitation tradeoff. To address this, we introduce Iterative
Regret-Minimization Fine-Tuning (Iterative RMFT), a post-training procedure
that repeatedly distills low-regret decision trajectories back into the base
model. At each iteration, the model rolls out multiple decision trajectories,
selects the k-lowest regret ones, and fine-tunes itself on them. Unlike prior
methods that (a) distill action sequences from known DM algorithms or (b) rely
on manually crafted chain-of-thought templates, our approach leverages the
regret metric to elicit the model's own DM ability and reasoning rationales.
This reliance on model-generated reasoning avoids rigid output engineering and
provides more flexible, natural-language training signals. Empirical results
show that Iterative RMFT improves LLMs' DM performance across diverse models -
from Transformers with numerical input/output, to open-weight LLMs, and
advanced closed-weight models like GPT-4o mini. Its flexibility in output and
reasoning formats enables generalization across tasks with varying horizons,
action spaces, reward processes, and natural-language contexts. Finally, we
provide theoretical insight showing that a single-layer Transformer under this
paradigm can act as a no-regret learner in a simplified setting. Overall,
Iterative RMFT offers a principled and general post-training framework for
enhancing LLMs' decision-making capabilities.

TL;DR: CoRPO解决了GRPO在序数奖励下强化错误行为的问题，通过自适应基线确保失败解不被正向强化，并在达到质量阈值后转向相对偏好模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO的简单性使其在序数奖励下会强化错误行为，需要改进以支持更丰富的非二元反馈。

Method: CoRPO使用自适应基线，设定最低质量阈值防止失败解被正向强化，达到阈值后自动切换到相对偏好模式。

Result: 在代码验证任务中，CoRPO表现出更稳定的收敛和更好的域外泛化能力。

Conclusion: CoRPO是使LLM通过强化学习学习新能力的重要一步，支持从二元奖励到序数奖励的过渡。

Abstract: Group-relative Policy Optimization's (GRPO) simplicity makes it highly
desirable for adapting LLMs to become experts at specific tasks. But this
simplicity also makes it ill-specified as we seek to enhance RL training with
richer, non-binary feedback. When using ordinal rewards to give partial credit,
GRPO's simplicity starts to hurt, as its group-average baseline often assigns a
positive advantage to failed trajectories and reinforces incorrect behavior.
  We introduce Correctness Relative Policy Optimization (CoRPO), a new
formulation that solves this flaw. CoRPO uses an adaptive baseline that
enforces a minimum quality threshold, ensuring failed solutions are never
positively reinforced. Once the policy consistently meets this threshold, the
baseline automatically transitions to a relative preference mode, pushing the
model to find optimal solutions rather than just "acceptable" ones. We
empirically validate CoRPO on a code verification task, where it demonstrates
more stable convergence and better out-of-domain generalization.
  This work represents a critical step in our broader research program to
enable LLMs to learn genuinely new capabilities through reinforcement learning.
We achieve this by enabling LLMs to learn from rich, multi-dimensional feedback
- progressing from binary to ordinal rewards in this work, and onward to
denser, per-step supervision.

TL;DR: PAVe系统结合传统路径规划算法与LLM语义推理，通过多目标Dijkstra算法生成候选路线，再由LLM代理根据用户任务、偏好和规避规则进行上下文评估，实现个性化车辆路由优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统车辆路由系统只能优化单一指标，无法理解人类驾驶员的复杂语义和动态上下文，如多步骤任务、情境约束或紧急需求。

Method: 使用多目标（时间、CO2）Dijkstra算法生成候选路线，然后通过LLM代理结合预处理的地理空间POI缓存，评估路线是否符合用户任务、偏好和规避规则。

Result: 在现实城市场景基准测试中，PAVe成功将复杂用户意图转化为适当的路线修改，使用本地模型在初始路线选择中达到超过88%的准确率。

Conclusion: 将经典路由算法与基于LLM的语义推理层相结合，是创建个性化、自适应和可扩展城市移动优化解决方案的稳健有效方法。

Abstract: Traditional vehicle routing systems efficiently optimize singular metrics
like time or distance, and when considering multiple metrics, they need more
processes to optimize . However, they lack the capability to interpret and
integrate the complex, semantic, and dynamic contexts of human drivers, such as
multi-step tasks, situational constraints, or urgent needs. This paper
introduces and evaluates PAVe (Personalized Agentic Vehicular Routing), a
hybrid agentic assistant designed to augment classical pathfinding algorithms
with contextual reasoning. Our approach employs a Large Language Model (LLM)
agent that operates on a candidate set of routes generated by a multi-objective
(time, CO2) Dijkstra algorithm. The agent evaluates these options against
user-provided tasks, preferences, and avoidance rules by leveraging a
pre-processed geospatial cache of urban Points of Interest (POIs). In a
benchmark of realistic urban scenarios, PAVe successfully used complex user
intent into appropriate route modifications, achieving over 88% accuracy in its
initial route selections with a local model. We conclude that combining
classical routing algorithms with an LLM-based semantic reasoning layer is a
robust and effective approach for creating personalized, adaptive, and scalable
solutions for urban mobility optimization.

Motivation: 尽管网络代理研究蓬勃发展，但其引发的可持续性问题仍未被充分探索。作者旨在揭示网络代理的能源和碳排放成本，强调这一问题的紧迫性。

Method: 采用理论估计和实证基准测试相结合的方法，从理论和实践两个角度分析网络代理的能耗情况。

Result: 研究结果显示，不同的网络代理设计理念会严重影响能耗，且更高的能耗并不一定带来更好的结果。同时发现某些网络代理在披露模型参数和流程方面缺乏透明度，限制了能耗估算的准确性。

Conclusion: 需要改变评估网络代理的方式，在基准测试中引入专门的能耗测量指标，以促进更可持续的网络代理开发。

Abstract: Web agents, like OpenAI's Operator and Google's Project Mariner, are powerful
agentic systems pushing the boundaries of Large Language Models (LLM). They can
autonomously interact with the internet at the user's behest, such as
navigating websites, filling search masks, and comparing price lists. Though
web agent research is thriving, induced sustainability issues remain largely
unexplored. To highlight the urgency of this issue, we provide an initial
exploration of the energy and $CO_2$ cost associated with web agents from both
a theoretical -via estimation- and an empirical perspective -by benchmarking.
Our results show how different philosophies in web agent creation can severely
impact the associated expended energy, and that more energy consumed does not
necessarily equate to better results. We highlight a lack of transparency
regarding disclosing model parameters and processes used for some web agents as
a limiting factor when estimating energy consumption. Our work contributes
towards a change in thinking of how we evaluate web agents, advocating for
dedicated metrics measuring energy consumption in benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLM在多大程度上能模拟人类决策行为至关重要，因为误对齐可能导致实际应用中的有害结果，而无法复制人类行为则使LLM在社会科学模拟中无效。

Method: 通过开发博弈论实验的数字孪生，引入系统提示和探测框架进行机器行为评估，测试了三个开源模型（Llama、Mistral和Qwen）。

Result: Llama能高保真复制人类合作模式，捕捉人类偏离理性选择理论的行为；Qwen则与纳什均衡预测紧密对齐。无需基于角色的提示就能实现群体层面的行为复制。

domains such as health, education and law, and to simulate human behavior. Yet
how closely LLMs mirror actual human decision-making remains poorly understood.
This gap is critical: misalignment could produce harmful outcomes in practical
applications, while failure to replicate human behavior renders LLMs
ineffective for social simulations. Here, we address this gap by developing a
digital twin of game-theoretic experiments and introducing a systematic
prompting and probing framework for machine-behavioral evaluation. Testing
three open-source models (Llama, Mistral and Qwen), we find that Llama
reproduces human cooperation patterns with high fidelity, capturing human
deviations from rational choice theory, while Qwen aligns closely with Nash
equilibrium predictions. Notably, we achieved population-level behavioral
replication without persona-based prompting, simplifying the simulation
process. Extending beyond the original human-tested games, we generate and
preregister testable hypotheses for novel game configurations outside the
original parameter grid. Our findings demonstrate that appropriately calibrated
LLMs can replicate aggregate human behavioral patterns and enable systematic
exploration of unexplored experimental spaces, offering a complementary
approach to traditional research in the social and behavioral sciences that
generates new empirical predictions about human social decision-making.

### [213] [Optimizing Sensor Placement in Urban Storm Sewers: A Data-Driven Sparse Sensing Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04556)
*Zihang Ding,Kun Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出数据驱动的稀疏感知框架，结合EPA-SWMM模型，优化传感器布设并重建雨水系统峰值流量，仅用3个传感器在77个节点中实现高精度流量重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市地表洪水因强降雨超过排水系统容量而日益频发，但高时空分辨率监测受时间、预算和技术限制，如何在资源受限条件下监测排水网络和预测流量是主要挑战。

Method: 使用EPA-SWMM模型生成训练数据集，应用数据驱动稀疏感知框架，利用奇异值分解降维和QR分解进行传感器分配，识别最优监测节点。

Result: 3个优化布设的传感器在77个节点中实现满意重建性能，NSE值0.92-0.95，模型对测量不确定性具有良好鲁棒性，对传感器故障的鲁棒性取决于位置并随传感器数量增加而改善。

Conclusion: 该框架平衡计算效率和物理可解释性，能以最少传感器实现高精度流量重建，可进一步与预测模型集成，在有限传感资源下实现洪水预警和实时控制。

Abstract: Urban surface water flooding, triggered by intense rainfall overwhelming
drainage systems, is increasingly frequent and widespread. While flood
prediction and monitoring in high spatial-temporal resolution are desired,
practical constraints in time, budget, and technology hinder its full
implementation. How to monitor urban drainage networks and predict flow
conditions under constrained resource is a major challenge. This study presents
a data-driven sparse sensing (DSS) framework, integrated with EPA-SWMM, to
optimize sensor placement and reconstruct peak flowrates in a stormwater
system, using the Woodland Avenue catchment in Duluth, Minnesota, as a case
study. We utilized a SWMM model to generate a training dataset of peak flowrate
profiles across the stormwater network. Furthermore, we applied DSS -
leveraging singular value decomposition for dimensionality reduction and QR
factorization for sensor allocation - to identify the optimal monitoring nodes
based on the simulated training dataset. We then validated the
representativeness of these identified monitoring nodes by comparing the
DSS-reconstructed peak flowrate profiles with those obtained from SWMM. Three
optimally placed sensors among 77 nodes achieved satisfactory reconstruction
performance with Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) values of 0.92-0.95 (25th to
75th percentiles). In addition, the model showed good robustness to uncertainty
in measurements. Its robustness to sensor failures is location-dependent and
improves with the number of sensors deployed. The framework balances
computational efficiency and physical interpretability, enabling high-accuracy
flow reconstruction with minimal sensors. This DSS framework can be further
integrated with predictive models to realize flood early warning and real-time
control under limited sensing and monitoring resource.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 开发了Jr. AI Scientist系统，这是一个模拟学生研究流程的自主AI科学家系统，能够分析论文局限性、提出假设、实验验证并撰写论文，在评估中表现优于现有全自动系统，但仍有重要局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解当前AI科学家系统的能力和风险对于确保可信赖和可持续的AI驱动科学进步至关重要，同时需要保护学术生态系统的完整性。

Method: 开发Jr. AI Scientist系统，模拟新手学生研究者的核心研究流程：分析基线论文局限性、制定改进假设、通过严格实验验证、撰写结果论文，利用现代编码代理处理复杂的多文件实现。

Result: Jr. AI Scientist生成的论文在AI评审员评估中获得比现有全自动系统更高的评分，但作者评估和Agents4Science评审仍发现重要局限性。

Abstract: Understanding the current capabilities and risks of AI Scientist systems is
essential for ensuring trustworthy and sustainable AI-driven scientific
progress while preserving the integrity of the academic ecosystem. To this end,
we develop Jr. AI Scientist, a state-of-the-art autonomous AI scientist system
that mimics the core research workflow of a novice student researcher: Given
the baseline paper from the human mentor, it analyzes its limitations,
formulates novel hypotheses for improvement, validates them through rigorous
experimentation, and writes a paper with the results. Unlike previous
approaches that assume full automation or operate on small-scale code, Jr. AI
Scientist follows a well-defined research workflow and leverages modern coding
agents to handle complex, multi-file implementations, leading to scientifically
valuable contributions. For evaluation, we conducted automated assessments
using AI Reviewers, author-led evaluations, and submissions to Agents4Science,
a venue dedicated to AI-driven scientific contributions. The findings
demonstrate that Jr. AI Scientist generates papers receiving higher review
scores than existing fully automated systems. Nevertheless, we identify
important limitations from both the author evaluation and the Agents4Science
reviews, indicating the potential risks of directly applying current AI
Scientist systems and key challenges for future research. Finally, we
comprehensively report various risks identified during development. We hope
these insights will deepen understanding of current progress and risks in AI
Scientist development.

### [215] [Are We Asking the Right Questions? On Ambiguity in Natural Language Queries for Tabular Data Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04584)
*Daniel Gomm,Cornelius Wolff,Madelon Hulsebos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出将自然语言查询中的歧义视为合作交互的特征而非缺陷，开发了一个区分可解析的合作查询与不可解析的非合作查询的框架，并分析了15个流行数据集中的查询类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将查询歧义视为缺陷，但作者认为歧义是合作交互的特征，查询规范的责任应由用户和系统共同承担。

Method: 开发了一个原则性框架来区分合作查询和非合作查询，并将该框架应用于15个流行表格问答和分析数据集的查询分析。

Result: 发现现有数据集混合了不同类型的查询，既不适合评估系统执行准确性，也不适合评估解释能力。

Conclusion: 该框架将视角从消除歧义转向在解析查询中拥抱合作，为表格数据自然语言接口的设计和评估提供了更明智的方法和未来研究方向。

Abstract: Natural language interfaces to tabular data must handle ambiguities inherent
to queries. Instead of treating ambiguity as a deficiency, we reframe it as a
feature of cooperative interaction, where the responsibility of query
specification is shared among the user and the system. We develop a principled
framework distinguishing cooperative queries, i.e., queries that yield a
resolvable interpretation, from uncooperative queries that cannot be resolved.
Applying the framework to evaluations for tabular question answering and
analysis, we analyze the queries in 15 popular datasets, and observe an
uncontrolled mixing of query types neither adequate for evaluating a system's
execution accuracy nor for evaluating interpretation capabilities. Our
framework and analysis of queries shifts the perspective from fixing ambiguity
to embracing cooperation in resolving queries. This reflection enables more
informed design and evaluation for natural language interfaces for tabular
data, for which we outline implications and directions for future research.

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于正当代表性概念的审计框架，用于衡量专家问答环节中问题选择的代表性，并开发了高效的审计算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在公民大会等审议过程中，参与者只能提出有限数量的问题给专家小组，需要确保选出的问题能够充分代表所有参与者的利益。

Method: 基于正当代表性概念建立审计框架，开发了运行时间为O(mn log n)的高效审计算法，并应用于历史审议数据进行比较分析。

Result: 比较了三种问题选择方式：主持人选择、整数线性规划选择和LLM生成的问题，发现LLM在支持审议过程中既有潜力也有当前局限性。

Conclusion: 通过将审计方法集成到在线审议平台，使实践者能够轻松审计和改进未来审议中的代表性。

Abstract: A central feature of many deliberative processes, such as citizens'
assemblies and deliberative polls, is the opportunity for participants to
engage directly with experts. While participants are typically invited to
propose questions for expert panels, only a limited number can be selected due
to time constraints. This raises the challenge of how to choose a small set of
questions that best represent the interests of all participants. We introduce
an auditing framework for measuring the level of representation provided by a
slate of questions, based on the social choice concept known as justified
representation (JR). We present the first algorithms for auditing JR in the
general utility setting, with our most efficient algorithm achieving a runtime
of $O(mn\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of participants and $m$ is the number
of proposed questions. We apply our auditing methods to historical
deliberations, comparing the representativeness of (a) the actual questions
posed to the expert panel (chosen by a moderator), (b) participants' questions
chosen via integer linear programming, (c) summary questions generated by large
language models (LLMs). Our results highlight both the promise and current
limitations of LLMs in supporting deliberative processes. By integrating our
methods into an online deliberation platform that has been used for over
hundreds of deliberations across more than 50 countries, we make it easy for
practitioners to audit and improve representation in future deliberations.

*Narjes Nourzad,Hanqing Yang,Shiyu Chen,Carlee Joe-Wong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DR.WELL是一个去中心化的神经符号框架，用于协作多智能体规划，通过两阶段协商协议和符号规划避免轨迹级协调的脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 协作多智能体规划中，轨迹级协调容易因微小的时间或运动偏差导致冲突，需要更高层次的抽象来确保同步和集体进展。

Method: 采用两阶段协商协议：智能体首先提出候选角色并推理，然后在共识和环境约束下承诺联合分配；承诺后每个智能体独立生成和执行符号计划，通过共享世界模型进行执行结果落地。

Result: 在协作推块任务实验中，动态世界模型通过协商和自我改进提高了任务完成率和效率，虽然有时间开销但获得了更高效的协作策略。

Conclusion: 通过符号规划而非原始轨迹推理，DR.WELL避免了脆弱的步骤级对齐，实现了可重用、可同步和可解释的高层操作，提升了多智能体协作的适应性和效率。

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent planning requires agents to make joint decisions with
partial information and limited communication. Coordination at the trajectory
level often fails, as small deviations in timing or movement cascade into
conflicts. Symbolic planning mitigates this challenge by raising the level of
abstraction and providing a minimal vocabulary of actions that enable
synchronization and collective progress. We present DR. WELL, a decentralized
neurosymbolic framework for cooperative multi-agent planning. Cooperation
unfolds through a two-phase negotiation protocol: agents first propose
candidate roles with reasoning and then commit to a joint allocation under
consensus and environment constraints. After commitment, each agent
independently generates and executes a symbolic plan for its role without
revealing detailed trajectories. Plans are grounded in execution outcomes via a
shared world model that encodes the current state and is updated as agents act.
By reasoning over symbolic plans rather than raw trajectories, DR. WELL avoids
brittle step-level alignment and enables higher-level operations that are
reusable, synchronizable, and interpretable. Experiments on cooperative
block-push tasks show that agents adapt across episodes, with the dynamic world
model capturing reusable patterns and improving task completion rates and
efficiency. Experiments on cooperative block-push tasks show that our dynamic
world model improves task completion and efficiency through negotiation and
self-refinement, trading a time overhead for evolving, more efficient
collaboration strategies.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VeriCoT是一个神经符号方法，通过将CoT推理步骤形式化为一阶逻辑，并使用自动求解器验证逻辑有效性，从而识别有缺陷的推理步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs虽然能进行多步推理，但无法可靠验证自身逻辑，即使在得出正确答案时，底层推理也可能存在缺陷，这在高风险场景中削弱了可信度。

Method: VeriCoT从CoT推理中提取形式逻辑论证，将每个推理步骤形式化为一阶逻辑，识别基于源上下文、常识知识或先前推理步骤的前提，并使用自动求解器验证逻辑有效性。

Result: 在ProofWriter、LegalBench和BioASQ数据集上的实验表明，VeriCoT能有效识别有缺陷的推理，并作为最终答案正确性的强预测指标。

Conclusion: VeriCoT不仅提高了推理的有效性和准确性，还可用于推理时自反思、监督微调和偏好微调，进一步改善推理质量。

Abstract: LLMs can perform multi-step reasoning through Chain-of-Thought (CoT), but
they cannot reliably verify their own logic. Even when they reach correct
answers, the underlying reasoning may be flawed, undermining trust in
high-stakes scenarios. To mitigate this issue, we introduce VeriCoT, a
neuro-symbolic method that extracts and verifies formal logical arguments from
CoT reasoning. VeriCoT formalizes each CoT reasoning step into first-order
logic and identifies premises that ground the argument in source context,
commonsense knowledge, or prior reasoning steps. The symbolic representation
enables automated solvers to verify logical validity while the NL premises
allow humans and systems to identify ungrounded or fallacious reasoning steps.
Experiments on the ProofWriter, LegalBench, and BioASQ datasets show VeriCoT
effectively identifies flawed reasoning, and serves as a strong predictor of
final answer correctness. We also leverage VeriCoT's verification signal for
(1) inference-time self-reflection, (2) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on
VeriCoT-distilled datasets and (3) preference fine-tuning (PFT) with direct
preference optimization (DPO) using verification-based pairwise rewards,
further improving reasoning validity and accuracy.
