TL;DR: 提出RMLP正则化方法，在微调DINOv2时提高注意力图的可解释性，同时保持或提升下游任务性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers在医学影像等领域存在注意力图可解释性差的问题，特别是面对领域偏移时性能和透明度都会下降

Method: 使用基于对比学习的Randomized-MLP正则化方法，在微调DINOv2时鼓励更语义对齐的表征

Result: RMLP在医学和自然图像模态上都提高了注意力图的可解释性，同时保持或提升了下游任务性能

Conclusion: RMLP正则化能有效增强ViT模型的可解释性，并提供了对对比学习机制的新理解

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs), such as DINOv2, achieve strong performance across domains but often repurpose low-informative patch tokens in ways that reduce the interpretability of attention and feature maps. This challenge is especially evident in medical imaging, where domain shifts can degrade both performance and transparency. In this paper, we introduce Randomized-MLP (RMLP) regularization, a contrastive learning-based method that encourages more semantically aligned representations. We use RMLPs when fine-tuning DINOv2 to both medical and natural image modalities, showing that it improves or maintains downstream performance while producing more interpretable attention maps. We also provide a mathematical analysis of RMLPs, offering insights into its role in enhancing ViT-based models and advancing our understanding of contrastive learning.

TL;DR: 针对大尺度弱纹理场景中3D高斯溅射的位姿估计不稳定和场景表示失真问题，提出结合LiDAR-IMU里程计先验位姿约束、法向量约束和有效秩正则化的优化方法，显著提升重建质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大尺度室外弱纹理或重复纹理场景中，由于几何纹理不一致导致的位姿估计不稳定和场景表示失真问题。

Method: 1. 位姿估计：利用LiDAR-IMU里程计提供先验位姿约束，结合COLMAP三角测量和光束法平差优化；2. 场景表示：引入法向量约束和有效秩正则化，与光度损失联合优化高斯基元的方向和形状一致性。

Result: 在公开和自采集数据集上验证：位姿优化时间减少2/3且保持精度；场景重建质量显著优于传统3DGS方法，尤其在弱纹理场景中可视化效果更好。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合先验位姿约束和几何一致性约束，有效解决了大尺度弱纹理场景中3D高斯溅射的稳定性问题，实现了高效高质量的重建。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a key rendering pipeline for digital asset creation due to its balance between efficiency and visual quality. To address the issues of unstable pose estimation and scene representation distortion caused by geometric texture inconsistency in large outdoor scenes with weak or repetitive textures, we approach the problem from two aspects: pose estimation and scene representation. For pose estimation, we leverage LiDAR-IMU Odometry to provide prior poses for cameras in large-scale environments. These prior pose constraints are incorporated into COLMAP's triangulation process, with pose optimization performed via bundle adjustment. Ensuring consistency between pixel data association and prior poses helps maintain both robustness and accuracy. For scene representation, we introduce normal vector constraints and effective rank regularization to enforce consistency in the direction and shape of Gaussian primitives. These constraints are jointly optimized with the existing photometric loss to enhance the map quality. We evaluate our approach using both public and self-collected datasets. In terms of pose optimization, our method requires only one-third of the time while maintaining accuracy and robustness across both datasets. In terms of scene representation, the results show that our method significantly outperforms conventional 3DGS pipelines. Notably, on self-collected datasets characterized by weak or repetitive textures, our approach demonstrates enhanced visualization capabilities and achieves superior overall performance. Codes and data will be publicly available at https://github.com/justinyeah/normal_shape.git.

### [3] [Token Is All You Need: Cognitive Planning through Sparse Intent Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05540)
*Shiyao Sang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 挑战自动驾驶需要详尽场景建模的传统假设，证明少量语义丰富的token足以实现高效规划，在nuPlan基准测试中取得优于现有方法的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质疑端到端自动驾驶必须进行详尽场景建模的长期假设，寻求更高效的规划方法替代计算密集的未来场景生成或受马尔可夫假设约束的视觉-语言-动作系统。

Method: 使用感知引导的BEV表示，基于稀疏语义token进行规划，比较有无未来预测token的条件轨迹解码效果，并测试显式重建损失的作用。

Result: 稀疏表示在无未来预测时达到0.548m ADE；加入未来token预测后ADE降至0.479m，提升12.6%；显式重建损失无益且可能损害性能；观察到时间模糊性现象。

Conclusion: "token即所需"原则标志着从重建世界到理解世界的范式转变，为通过想象而非反应进行规划的认知启发系统奠定基础。

Abstract: We challenge the long-standing assumption that exhaustive scene modeling is required for high-performance end-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD). Unlike world-model approaches that rely on computationally intensive future scene generation or vision-language-action (VLA) systems constrained by Markov assumptions, we show that a minimal set of semantically rich tokens is sufficient for effective planning. Experiments on the nuPlan benchmark (720 scenarios, over 11,000 samples) using perception-informed BEV representations yield three key findings: (1) even without future prediction, our sparse representation achieves 0.548 m ADE, comparable to or surpassing prior methods reporting around 0.75 m on nuScenes; (2) conditioning trajectory decoding on predicted future tokens reduces ADE to 0.479 m, a 12.6% improvement over current-state baselines; and (3) explicit reconstruction loss offers no benefit and may degrade performance under reliable perception inputs. Notably, we observe the emergence of temporal fuzziness, where the model adaptively attends to task-relevant semantics rather than aligning rigidly to fixed timestamps, providing a cognitive advantage for planning under uncertainty. Our "token is all you need" principle marks a paradigm shift from reconstructing the world to understanding it, laying a foundation for cognitively inspired systems that plan through imagination rather than reaction.

### [4] [Automated Invoice Data Extraction: Using LLM and OCR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05547)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合OCR、深度学习、LLM和图分析的整体AI平台，旨在解决传统OCR系统在发票布局变化、手写文本和低质量扫描方面的局限性，实现前所未有的信息提取质量和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统OCR系统对模板依赖性强，难以应对发票布局变化、手写文本和低质量扫描等挑战，限制了其在不同文档结构和布局中的灵活性。

Method: 采用混合架构，结合OCR技术、深度学习模型（CNN和Transformer）、领域特定模型、大型语言模型（LLM）和图分析，构建整体AI平台。

Result: 通过视觉命名实体识别（NER）能力，从发票图像中提取信息具有更高的上下文敏感性和准确性，超越了传统方法。

Conclusion: 混合架构结合OCR和LLM技术能够实现最大可扩展性和最少人工干预，为发票信息提取提供了高质量和一致性的解决方案。

Abstract: Conventional Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems are challenged by
variant invoice layouts, handwritten text, and low- quality scans, which are
often caused by strong template dependencies that restrict their flexibility
across different document structures and layouts. Newer solutions utilize
advanced deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) as
well as Transformers, and domain-specific models for better layout analysis and
accuracy across various sections over varied document types. Large Language
Models (LLMs) have revolutionized extraction pipelines at their core with
sophisticated entity recognition and semantic comprehension to support complex
contextual relationship mapping without direct programming specification.
Visual Named Entity Recognition (NER) capabilities permit extraction from
invoice images with greater contextual sensitivity and much higher accuracy
rates than older approaches. Existing industry best practices utilize hybrid
architectures that blend OCR technology and LLM for maximum scalability and
minimal human intervention. This work introduces a holistic Artificial
Intelligence (AI) platform combining OCR, deep learning, LLMs, and graph
analytics to achieve unprecedented extraction quality and consistency.

### [5] [In-Context-Learning-Assisted Quality Assessment Vision-Language Models for Metal Additive Manufacturing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05551)
*Qiaojie Zheng,Jiucai Zhang,Xiaoli Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 利用视觉语言模型（VLMs）的推理能力和上下文学习（ICL）来评估增材制造中打印件的质量，无需大量应用特定数据集训练，仅需少量样本即可达到与传统机器学习模型相当的分类准确率，并提供可解释的推理依据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于视觉的增材制造质量评估通常需要专门的机器学习模型和应用特定数据集，但数据收集和模型训练成本高、耗时长。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型的推理能力，引入上下文学习为VLMs提供必要的应用特定知识和演示样本，探索不同的ICL采样策略寻找最优配置。

Result: ICL辅助的VLMs在丝材激光直接能量沉积工艺的质量评估任务中，仅需少量样本即可达到与传统机器学习模型相似的分类准确率，并能生成人类可解释的推理依据。

Conclusion: ICL辅助的VLMs能够用有限数据解决应用特定任务，在实现较高准确率的同时提供有效的支持推理，提高决策透明度。

Abstract: Vision-based quality assessment in additive manufacturing often requires dedicated machine learning models and application-specific datasets. However, data collection and model training can be expensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we leverage vision-language models' (VLMs') reasoning capabilities to assess the quality of printed parts and introduce in-context learning (ICL) to provide VLMs with necessary application-specific knowledge and demonstration samples. This method eliminates the requirement for large application-specific datasets for training models. We explored different sampling strategies for ICL to search for the optimal configuration that makes use of limited samples. We evaluated these strategies on two VLMs, Gemini-2.5-flash and Gemma3:27b, with quality assessment tasks in wire-laser direct energy deposition processes. The results show that ICL-assisted VLMs can reach quality classification accuracies similar to those of traditional machine learning models while requiring only a minimal number of samples. In addition, unlike traditional classification models that lack transparency, VLMs can generate human-interpretable rationales to enhance trust. Since there are no metrics to evaluate their interpretability in manufacturing applications, we propose two metrics, knowledge relevance and rationale validity, to evaluate the quality of VLMs' supporting rationales. Our results show that ICL-assisted VLMs can address application-specific tasks with limited data, achieving relatively high accuracy while also providing valid supporting rationales for improved decision transparency.

Abstract: In complex embodied long-horizon manipulation tasks, effective task decomposition and execution require synergistic integration of textual logical reasoning and visual-spatial imagination to ensure efficient and accurate operation. Current methods fail to adopt a unified generation framework for multimodal planning, lead to inconsistent in multimodal planning. To address this challenge, we present \textbf{EVLP (Embodied Vision-Language Planner)}, an innovative multimodal unified generation framework that jointly models linguistic reasoning and visual generation. Our approach achieves multimodal planning for long-horizon tasks through a novel training pipeline incorporating dynamic pretraining and reinforced alignment. Our core innovations consist of three key components: \textbf{1) Unified Multimodal Generation Framework}: For understanding, We integrate semantic information with spatial features to provide comprehensive visual perception. For generation, we directly learn the joint distribution of discrete images for one-step visual synthesis, enabling coordinated language-visual modeling through learnable cross-modal attention mechanisms. \textbf{2) Dynamic Perception Pretraining}: We propose a bidirectional dynamic alignment strategy employing inverse dynamics tasks and forward dynamics tasks, effectively strengthening multimodal correlations within a unified feature space. \textbf{3) Reinforced Supervised Fine-Tuning}: While conducting instruction-based fine-tuning in the unified generation space, we construct a reinforce loss to align the spatial logic between textual actions and generated images, enabling the model to acquire spatio-awared multimodal planning capabilities.

### [7] [MCFCN: Multi-View Clustering via a Fusion-Consensus Graph Convolutional Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05554)
*Chenping Pei,Fadi Dornaika,Jingjun Bi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于融合共识图卷积网络的多视图聚类方法MCFCN，通过端到端学习多视图数据的共识图，解决了现有方法忽视数据拓扑结构、易受噪声干扰、跨视图一致性考虑不足等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于子空间学习的多视图聚类方法侧重于共识表示学习但忽视数据固有拓扑结构；基于图神经网络的方法输入图结构易受噪声干扰；基于多视图图优化的方法存在跨视图一致性考虑不足、难以处理特征空间中难区分样本以及优化过程不连贯等问题。

Conclusion: MCFCN通过端到端学习共识图，有效解决了多视图聚类中的拓扑结构保持、噪声鲁棒性和跨视图一致性问题，显著提升了聚类性能。

Abstract: Existing Multi-view Clustering (MVC) methods based on subspace learning focus on consensus representation learning while neglecting the inherent topological structure of data. Despite the integration of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) into MVC, their input graph structures remain susceptible to noise interference. Methods based on Multi-view Graph Refinement (MGRC) also have limitations such as insufficient consideration of cross-view consistency, difficulty in handling hard-to-distinguish samples in the feature space, and disjointed optimization processes caused by graph construction algorithms. To address these issues, a Multi-View Clustering method via a Fusion-Consensus Graph Convolutional Network (MCFCN) is proposed. The network learns the consensus graph of multi-view data in an end-to-end manner and learns effective consensus representations through a view feature fusion model and a Unified Graph Structure Adapter (UGA). It designs Similarity Matrix Alignment Loss (SMAL) and Feature Representation Alignment Loss (FRAL). With the guidance of consensus, it optimizes view-specific graphs, preserves cross-view topological consistency, promotes the construction of intra-class edges, and realizes effective consensus representation learning with the help of GCN to improve clustering performance. MCFCN demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on eight multi-view benchmark datasets, and its effectiveness is verified by extensive qualitative and quantitative implementations. The code will be provided at https://github.com/texttao/MCFCN.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个多任务模型压缩框架，结合任务感知安全剪枝和特征级知识蒸馏，在BDD100K数据集上实现32.7%参数减少，同时保持实时性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶系统依赖全景感知进行多任务处理，但多任务学习模型参数和复杂度增加，难以在车载设备上部署。

Result: 压缩模型参数减少32.7%，分割性能几乎无损失，检测性能轻微下降（召回率-1.2%，mAP50 -1.8%），仍保持32.7 FPS实时运行。

Conclusion: 剪枝和知识蒸馏结合为多任务全景感知提供了有效的压缩解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems rely on panoptic perception to jointly handle object detection, drivable area segmentation, and lane line segmentation. Although multi-task learning is an effective way to integrate these tasks, its increasing model parameters and complexity make deployment on on-board devices difficult. To address this challenge, we propose a multi-task model compression framework that combines task-aware safe pruning with feature-level knowledge distillation. Our safe pruning strategy integrates Taylor-based channel importance with gradient conflict penalty to keep important channels while removing redundant and conflicting channels. To mitigate performance degradation after pruning, we further design a task head-agnostic distillation method that transfers intermediate backbone and encoder features from a teacher to a student model as guidance. Experiments on the BDD100K dataset demonstrate that our compressed model achieves a 32.7% reduction in parameters while segmentation performance shows negligible accuracy loss and only a minor decrease in detection (-1.2% for Recall and -1.8% for mAP50) compared to the teacher. The compressed model still runs at 32.7 FPS in real-time. These results show that combining pruning and knowledge distillation provides an effective compression solution for multi-task panoptic perception.

### [9] [FilletRec: A Lightweight Graph Neural Network with Intrinsic Features for Automated Fillet Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05561)

Conclusion: 该框架通过数据驱动方法有效解决了CAD圆角特征识别与简化的挑战，为CAE分析提供了高效可靠的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Automated recognition and simplification of fillet features in CAD models is critical for CAE analysis, yet it remains an open challenge. Traditional rule-based methods lack robustness, while existing deep learning models suffer from poor generalization and low accuracy on complex fillets due to their generic design and inadequate training data. To address these issues, this paper proposes an end-to-end, data-driven framework specifically for fillet features. We first construct and release a large-scale, diverse benchmark dataset for fillet recognition to address the inadequacy of existing data. Based on it, we propose FilletRec, a lightweight graph neural network. The core innovation of this network is its use of pose-invariant intrinsic geometric features, such as curvature, enabling it to learn more fundamental geometric patterns and thereby achieve high-precision recognition of complex geometric topologies. Experiments show that FilletRec surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and generalization, while using only 0.2\%-5.4\% of the parameters of baseline models, demonstrating high model efficiency. Finally, the framework completes the automated workflow from recognition to simplification by integrating an effective geometric simplification algorithm.

Conclusion: M2S2L框架在保持高效计算的同时实现了优异的异常检测性能，适合实际监控部署

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is an essential task in the image processing community with prospects in video surveillance, which faces fundamental challenges in balancing detection accuracy with computational efficiency. As video content becomes increasingly complex with diverse behavioral patterns and contextual scenarios, traditional VAD approaches struggle to provide robust assessment for modern surveillance systems. Existing methods either lack comprehensive spatial-temporal modeling or require excessive computational resources for real-time applications. In this regard, we present a Mamba-based multi-scale spatial-temporal learning (M2S2L) framework in this paper. The proposed method employs hierarchical spatial encoders operating at multiple granularities and multi-temporal encoders capturing motion dynamics across different time scales. We also introduce a feature decomposition mechanism to enable task-specific optimization for appearance and motion reconstruction, facilitating more nuanced behavioral modeling and quality-aware anomaly assessment. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that M2S2L framework achieves 98.5%, 92.1%, and 77.9% frame-level AUCs on UCSD Ped2, CUHK Avenue, and ShanghaiTech respectively, while maintaining efficiency with 20.1G FLOPs and 45 FPS inference speed, making it suitable for practical surveillance deployment.

TL;DR: 本文研究了基础视觉语言模型在生物医学显微镜图像上的少样本目标检测能力，提出了Micro-OD基准测试，评估了8个VLM模型，并开发了混合FSOD管道来提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础视觉语言模型在自然图像上表现出色，但在生物医学显微镜领域的应用尚未充分探索，特别是在缺乏大型标注数据集的情况下如何实现少样本目标检测。

Method: 构建了包含252张图像的Micro-OD基准测试集，系统评估了8个VLM模型在少样本条件下的表现，并实现了结合检测头和VLM分类器的混合FSOD管道。

Result: 零样本性能较弱，但少样本支持能持续改善检测效果，6个样本后边际收益递减；带有推理token的模型更适合端到端定位，而简化变体更适合分类预定位裁剪区域。

Conclusion: 上下文适应是显微镜图像处理的实用路径，该基准为推进生物医学成像中的开放词汇检测提供了可复现的测试平台。

Abstract: Foundation vision-language models (VLMs) excel on natural images, but their utility for biomedical microscopy remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate how in-context learning enables state-of-the-art VLMs to perform few-shot object detection when large annotated datasets are unavailable, as is often the case with microscopic images. We introduce the Micro-OD benchmark, a curated collection of 252 images specifically curated for in-context learning, with bounding-box annotations spanning 11 cell types across four sources, including two in-lab expert-annotated sets. We systematically evaluate eight VLMs under few-shot conditions and compare variants with and without implicit test-time reasoning tokens. We further implement a hybrid Few-Shot Object Detection (FSOD) pipeline that combines a detection head with a VLM-based few-shot classifier, which enhances the few-shot performance of recent VLMs on our benchmark. Across datasets, we observe that zero-shot performance is weak due to the domain gap; however, few-shot support consistently improves detection, with marginal gains achieved after six shots. We observe that models with reasoning tokens are more effective for end-to-end localization, whereas simpler variants are more suitable for classifying pre-localized crops. Our results highlight in-context adaptation as a practical path for microscopy, and our benchmark provides a reproducible testbed for advancing open-vocabulary detection in biomedical imaging.

Motivation: 现有传感器人类活动识别的在线持续学习方法计算密集且需要大量标注样本，而预训练模型方法在计算机视觉中表现出色但难以直接应用于HAR领域，因为HAR数据集异构性强且部署后标注数据稀缺。

Method: 使用对比学习在有限数据上预训练特征提取器并在流式学习阶段冻结，用关系模块网络替代传统的密集分类层，降低资源消耗并提高数据效率。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的实验表明，PTRN-HAR在保持高性能的同时显著减少了模型训练所需的资源消耗，并降低了有效持续学习所需的标注数据量，超越了现有最优方法。

Conclusion: PTRN-HAR成功解决了预训练模型在传感器人类活动识别在线持续学习中的应用挑战，为资源受限环境下的HAR系统提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Machine learning models for sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) are
expected to adapt post-deployment to recognize new activities and different
ways of performing existing ones. To address this need, Online Continual
Learning (OCL) mechanisms have been proposed, allowing models to update their
knowledge incrementally as new data become available while preserving
previously acquired information. However, existing OCL approaches for
sensor-based HAR are computationally intensive and require extensive labeled
samples to represent new changes. Recently, pre-trained model-based (PTM-based)
OCL approaches have shown significant improvements in performance and
efficiency for computer vision applications. These methods achieve strong
generalization capabilities by pre-training complex models on large datasets,
followed by fine-tuning on downstream tasks for continual learning. However,
applying PTM-based OCL approaches to sensor-based HAR poses significant
challenges due to the inherent heterogeneity of HAR datasets and the scarcity
of labeled data in post-deployment scenarios. This paper introduces PTRN-HAR,
the first successful application of PTM-based OCL to sensor-based HAR. Unlike
prior PTM-based OCL approaches, PTRN-HAR pre-trains the feature extractor using
contrastive loss with a limited amount of data. This extractor is then frozen
during the streaming stage. Furthermore, it replaces the conventional dense
classification layer with a relation module network. Our design not only
significantly reduces the resource consumption required for model training
while maintaining high performance, but also improves data efficiency by
reducing the amount of labeled data needed for effective continual learning, as
demonstrated through experiments on three public datasets, outperforming the
state-of-the-art. The code can be found here:

Conclusion: 自适应DBN RoadTracer方法显著提高了道路网络识别精度，并可在嵌入式设备上实现轻量级深度学习，适用于灾害应急响应。

Abstract: An adaptive structural learning method of Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) and Deep Belief Network (DBN) has been developed as one of prominent deep learning models. The neuron generation-annihilation algorithm in RBM and layer generation algorithm in DBN make an optimal network structure for given input during the learning. In this paper, our model is applied to an automatic recognition method of road network system, called RoadTracer. RoadTracer can generate a road map on the ground surface from aerial photograph data. A novel method of RoadTracer using the Teacher-Student based ensemble learning model of Adaptive DBN is proposed, since the road maps contain many complicated features so that a model with high representation power to detect should be required. The experimental results showed the detection accuracy of the proposed model was improved from 40.0\% to 89.0\% on average in the seven major cities among the test dataset. In addition, we challenged to apply our method to the detection of available roads when landslide by natural disaster is occurred, in order to rapidly obtain a way of transportation. For fast inference, a small size of the trained model was implemented on a small embedded edge device as lightweight deep learning. We reported the detection results for the satellite image before and after the rainfall disaster in Japan.

TL;DR: 本研究比较了街景图像(SVI)和公众参与GIS(PPGIS)在捕捉城市环境感知方面的一致性，发现两者只有部分对齐，非视觉线索对感知差异有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数字工具日益影响空间规划实践，理解不同数据源如何反映人类对城市环境的体验至关重要。SVI和PPGIS是捕捉基于地点的感知的两种主要方法，但它们的可比性仍未充分探索。

Method: 使用参与者评分的SVI数据和语义图像分割，训练机器学习模型基于视觉特征预测感知吸引力，并将这些预测与PPGIS识别的有吸引力或无吸引力位置进行比较，使用严格和中等标准计算一致性。

Result: 研究发现两个数据集只有部分对齐：中等标准下，有吸引力地点的一致性为67%，无吸引力地点为77%；严格标准下分别降至27%和29%。非视觉线索(如噪音、交通、人群存在和土地使用)显著导致不匹配。

Conclusion: 虽然SVI提供了城市感知的可扩展视觉代理，但不能完全替代PPGIS捕捉的体验丰富性。两种方法都有价值但服务于不同目的，需要更综合的方法来全面捕捉人们对城市环境的感知。

Abstract: As digital tools increasingly shape spatial planning practices, understanding how different data sources reflect human experiences of urban environments is essential. Street View Imagery (SVI) and Public Participation GIS (PPGIS) represent two prominent approaches for capturing place-based perceptions that can support urban planning decisions, yet their comparability remains underexplored. This study investigates the alignment between SVI-based perceived attractiveness and residents' reported experiences gathered via a city-wide PPGIS survey in Helsinki, Finland. Using participant-rated SVI data and semantic image segmentation, we trained a machine learning model to predict perceived attractiveness based on visual features. We compared these predictions to PPGIS-identified locations marked as attractive or unattractive, calculating agreement using two sets of strict and moderate criteria. Our findings reveal only partial alignment between the two datasets. While agreement (with a moderate threshold) reached 67% for attractive and 77% for unattractive places, agreement (with a strict threshold) dropped to 27% and 29%, respectively. By analysing a range of contextual variables, including noise, traffic, population presence, and land use, we found that non-visual cues significantly contributed to mismatches. The model failed to account for experiential dimensions such as activity levels and environmental stressors that shape perceptions but are not visible in images. These results suggest that while SVI offers a scalable and visual proxy for urban perception, it cannot fully substitute the experiential richness captured through PPGIS. We argue that both methods are valuable but serve different purposes; therefore, a more integrated approach is needed to holistically capture how people perceive urban environments.

*Xiaofei Wang,Stephen Price,Chao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: C3-Diff是一个跨模态跨内容对比扩散框架，利用组织学图像指导增强空间转录组学(ST)图谱的分辨率，通过改进对比学习、特征增强和动态跨模态插补策略，在多个数据集上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前空间转录组学平台分辨率较低，限制了空间基因表达的深入理解。虽然超分辨率方法有望通过整合组织学图像和基因表达来增强ST图谱，但如何有效建模组织学图像与基因表达之间的交互仍然是一个挑战。

Method: 提出C3-Diff框架：1)改进传统对比学习范式，提取模态不变和内容不变特征；2)在特征单元超球面上进行基于噪声的信息增强，克服ST图谱测序灵敏度低的问题；3)采用动态跨模态插补训练策略缓解ST数据稀缺问题。

Result: 在四个公共数据集上测试，C3-Diff相比竞争方法取得显著改进。在下游任务评估中，包括细胞类型定位、基因表达相关性和单细胞水平基因表达预测等方面表现优异。

Conclusion: C3-Diff促进了AI增强生物技术在生物医学研究和临床应用中的发展，为空间转录组学增强提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of spatial transcriptomics (ST), i.e., spatial gene expressions, has made it possible to measure gene expression within original tissue, enabling us to discover molecular mechanisms. However, current ST platforms frequently suffer from low resolution, limiting the in-depth understanding of spatial gene expression. Super-resolution approaches promise to enhance ST maps by integrating histology images with gene expressions of profiled tissue spots. However, it remains a challenge to model the interactions between histology images and gene expressions for effective ST enhancement. This study presents a cross-modal cross-content contrastive diffusion framework, called C3-Diff, for ST enhancement with histology images as guidance. In C3-Diff, we firstly analyze the deficiency of traditional contrastive learning paradigm, which is then refined to extract both modal-invariant and content-invariant features of ST maps and histology images. Further, to overcome the problem of low sequencing sensitivity in ST maps, we perform nosing-based information augmentation on the surface of feature unit hypersphere. Finally, we propose a dynamic cross-modal imputation-based training strategy to mitigate ST data scarcity. We tested C3-Diff by benchmarking its performance on four public datasets, where it achieves significant improvements over competing methods. Moreover, we evaluate C3-Diff on downstream tasks of cell type localization, gene expression correlation and single-cell-level gene expression prediction, promoting AI-enhanced biotechnology for biomedical research and clinical applications.

*Ziyang Liu,Kevin Valencia,Justin Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种轻量级方法，通过合成监督改进文本到视频(T2V)扩散模型，解决视频中文本可读性和连贯性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2V模型在生成视频中文本时存在困难，无法正确渲染短短语或单词，且现有解决方案计算成本高，不适合视频生成。

Method: 使用文本到图像(T2I)扩散模型生成含文本图像，再用文本无关的图像到视频(I2V)模型将其动画化为短视频，用这些合成视频-提示对微调预训练T2V模型Wan2.1。

Result: 在短文本可读性和时间一致性方面有所改进，对长文本出现结构先验。

Conclusion: 精心策划的合成数据和弱监督为提高T2V生成中文本保真度提供了实用路径。

Abstract: While Text-To-Video (T2V) models have advanced rapidly, they continue to struggle with generating legible and coherent text within videos. In particular, existing models often fail to render correctly even short phrases or words and previous attempts to address this problem are computationally expensive and not suitable for video generation. In this work, we investigate a lightweight approach to improve T2V diffusion models using synthetic supervision. We first generate text-rich images using a text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model, then animate them into short videos using a text-agnostic image-to-video (I2v) model. These synthetic video-prompt pairs are used to fine-tune Wan2.1, a pre-trained T2V model, without any architectural changes. Our results show improvement in short-text legibility and temporal consistency with emerging structural priors for longer text. These findings suggest that curated synthetic data and weak supervision offer a practical path toward improving textual fidelity in T2V generation.

Abstract: Reflection on one's thought process and making corrections to it if there exists dissatisfaction in its performance is, perhaps, one of the essential traits of intelligence. However, such high-level abstract concepts mandatory for Artificial General Intelligence can be modelled even at the low level of narrow Machine Learning algorithms. Here, we present the self-awareness mechanism emulation in the form of a supervising artificial neural network (ANN) observing patterns in activations of another underlying ANN in a search for indications of the high uncertainty of the underlying ANN and, therefore, the trustworthiness of its predictions. The underlying ANN is a convolutional neural network (CNN) ensemble employed for face recognition and facial expression tasks. The self-awareness ANN has a memory region where its past performance information is stored, and its learnable parameters are adjusted during the training to optimize the performance. The trustworthiness verdict triggers the active learning mode, giving elements of agency to the machine learning algorithm that asks for human help in high uncertainty and confusion conditions.

Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的人脸交换方法在挑战性姿态和表情下存在细粒度伪影和身份保持不佳的问题，主要原因是未能有效利用3D面部结构来解耦身份与姿态/表情。

Method: 提出DiffSwap++管道，在训练中融入3D面部潜在特征，通过3D感知表示引导生成过程，并设计扩散架构在去噪过程中同时条件化身份嵌入和面部关键点。

Conclusion: DiffSwap++通过结合3D面部特征显著提升了人脸交换的质量和身份保持能力，为扩散模型在人脸交换领域的应用提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Diffusion-based approaches have recently achieved strong results in face swapping, offering improved visual quality over traditional GAN-based methods. However, even state-of-the-art models often suffer from fine-grained artifacts and poor identity preservation, particularly under challenging poses and expressions. A key limitation of existing approaches is their failure to meaningfully leverage 3D facial structure, which is crucial for disentangling identity from pose and expression. In this work, we propose DiffSwap++, a novel diffusion-based face-swapping pipeline that incorporates 3D facial latent features during training. By guiding the generation process with 3D-aware representations, our method enhances geometric consistency and improves the disentanglement of facial identity from appearance attributes. We further design a diffusion architecture that conditions the denoising process on both identity embeddings and facial landmarks, enabling high-fidelity and identity-preserving face swaps. Extensive experiments on CelebA, FFHQ, and CelebV-Text demonstrate that DiffSwap++ outperforms prior methods in preserving source identity while maintaining target pose and expression. Additionally, we introduce a biometric-style evaluation and conduct a user study to further validate the realism and effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: 提出一种双分支sigmoid头方法，解决传统CAM方法因softmax分类器导致的两种基本失真问题，在保持分类精度的同时提升定位性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CAM方法依赖最终softmax分类器，存在两种基本失真：加法logit偏移会任意偏置重要性分数，符号崩溃会混淆兴奋性和抑制性特征。

Method: 提出架构无关的双分支sigmoid头，克隆预训练模型的分类头到并行分支，使用sigmoid输出，冻结原始softmax头，仅微调sigmoid分支。

Result: 在细粒度任务和WSOL基准测试中显示改进的解释保真度和一致的Top-1定位增益，且分类精度无下降。

Conclusion: 该方法与大多数CAM变体无缝集成，开销可忽略，在保持识别精度的同时生成更准确的类别证据图。

Abstract: Class Activation Mapping (CAM) and its extensions have become indispensable tools for visualizing the evidence behind deep network predictions. However, by relying on a final softmax classifier, these methods suffer from two fundamental distortions: additive logit shifts that arbitrarily bias importance scores, and sign collapse that conflates excitatory and inhibitory features. We propose a simple, architecture-agnostic dual-branch sigmoid head that decouples localization from classification. Given any pretrained model, we clone its classification head into a parallel branch ending in per-class sigmoid outputs, freeze the original softmax head, and fine-tune only the sigmoid branch with class-balanced binary supervision. At inference, softmax retains recognition accuracy, while class evidence maps are generated from the sigmoid branch -- preserving both magnitude and sign of feature contributions. Our method integrates seamlessly with most CAM variants and incurs negligible overhead. Extensive evaluations on fine-grained tasks (CUB-200-2011, Stanford Cars) and WSOL benchmarks (ImageNet-1K, OpenImages30K) show improved explanation fidelity and consistent Top-1 Localization gains -- without any drop in classification accuracy.

Abstract: This paper proposes a MedGemma-based framework for automatic abnormality detection in musculoskeletal radiographs. Departing from conventional autoencoder and neural network pipelines, the proposed method leverages the MedGemma foundation model, incorporating a SigLIP-derived vision encoder pretrained on diverse medical imaging modalities. Preprocessed X-ray images are encoded into high-dimensional embeddings using the MedGemma vision backbone, which are subsequently passed through a lightweight multilayer perceptron for binary classification. Experimental assessment reveals that the MedGemma-driven classifier exhibits strong performance, exceeding conventional convolutional and autoencoder-based metrics. Additionally, the model leverages MedGemma's transfer learning capabilities, enhancing generalization and optimizing feature engineering. The integration of a modern medical foundation model not only enhances representation learning but also facilitates modular training strategies such as selective encoder block unfreezing for efficient domain adaptation. The findings suggest that MedGemma-powered classification systems can advance clinical radiograph triage by providing scalable and accurate abnormality detection, with potential for broader applications in automated medical image analysis.

Abstract: Additive manufacturing (AM) is an emerging digital manufacturing technology to produce complex and freeform objects through a layer-wise deposition. High deposition rate robotic AM (HDRRAM) processes, such as cold spray additive manufacturing (CSAM), offer significantly increased build speeds by delivering large volumes of material per unit time. However, maintaining shape accuracy remains a critical challenge, particularly due to process instabilities in current open-loop systems. Detecting these deviations as they occur is essential to prevent error propagation, ensure part quality, and minimize post-processing requirements. This study presents a real-time monitoring system to acquire and reconstruct the growing part and directly compares it with a near-net reference model to detect the shape deviation during the manufacturing process. The early identification of shape inconsistencies, followed by segmenting and tracking each deviation region, paves the way for timely intervention and compensation to achieve consistent part quality.

Abstract: Recent advancements in optimization-based text-to-3D generation heavily rely on distilling knowledge from pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models using techniques like Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), which often introduce artifacts such as over-saturation and over-smoothing into the generated 3D assets. In this paper, we address this essential problem by formulating the generation process as learning an optimal, direct transport trajectory between the distribution of the current rendering and the desired target distribution, thereby enabling high-quality generation with smaller Classifier-free Guidance (CFG) values. At first, we theoretically establish SDS as a simplified instance of the Schrödinger Bridge framework. We prove that SDS employs the reverse process of an Schrödinger Bridge, which, under specific conditions (e.g., a Gaussian noise as one end), collapses to SDS's score function of the pre-trained diffusion model. Based upon this, we introduce Trajectory-Centric Distillation (TraCe), a novel text-to-3D generation framework, which reformulates the mathematically trackable framework of Schrödinger Bridge to explicitly construct a diffusion bridge from the current rendering to its text-conditioned, denoised target, and trains a LoRA-adapted model on this trajectory's score dynamics for robust 3D optimization. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TraCe consistently achieves superior quality and fidelity to state-of-the-art techniques.

Abstract: Human pose serves as a cornerstone of action quality assessment (AQA), where subtle spatial-temporal variations in pose often distinguish excellence from mediocrity. In high-level competitions, these nuanced differences become decisive factors in scoring. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-level motion parsing framework for AQA based on enhanced spatial-temporal pose features. On the first level, the Action-Unit Parser is designed with the help of pose extraction to achieve precise action segmentation and comprehensive local-global pose representations. On the second level, Motion Parser is used by spatial-temporal feature learning to capture pose changes and appearance details for each action-unit. Meanwhile, some special conditions other than body-related will impact action scoring, like water splash in diving. In this work, we design an additional Condition Parser to offer users more flexibility in their choices. Finally, Weight-Adjust Scoring Module is introduced to better accommodate the diverse requirements of various action types and the multi-scale nature of action-units. Extensive evaluations on large-scale diving sports datasets demonstrate that our multi-level motion parsing framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in both action segmentation and action scoring tasks.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have made remarkable strides in generating and editing high-fidelity images from text. Yet, these models remain fundamentally generic, failing to adapt to the nuanced aesthetic preferences of individual users. In this work, we present the first framework for personalized image editing in diffusion models, introducing Collaborative Direct Preference Optimization (C-DPO), a novel method that aligns image edits with user-specific preferences while leveraging collaborative signals from like-minded individuals. Our approach encodes each user as a node in a dynamic preference graph and learns embeddings via a lightweight graph neural network, enabling information sharing across users with overlapping visual tastes. We enhance a diffusion model's editing capabilities by integrating these personalized embeddings into a novel DPO objective, which jointly optimizes for individual alignment and neighborhood coherence. Comprehensive experiments, including user studies and quantitative benchmarks, demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines in generating edits that are aligned with user preferences.

Conclusion: CFC-CapsNet有效解决了CapsNet的局限性，是更高效实用的胶囊网络变体。

Abstract: A Capsule Network (CapsNet) is a relatively new classifier and one of the possible successors of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CapsNet maintains the spatial hierarchies between the features and outperforms CNNs at classifying images including overlapping categories. Even though CapsNet works well on small-scale datasets such as MNIST, it fails to achieve a similar level of performance on more complicated datasets and real applications. In addition, CapsNet is slow compared to CNNs when performing the same task and relies on a higher number of parameters. In this work, we introduce Convolutional Fully-Connected Capsule Network (CFC-CapsNet) to address the shortcomings of CapsNet by creating capsules using a different method. We introduce a new layer (CFC layer) as an alternative solution to creating capsules. CFC-CapsNet produces fewer, yet more powerful capsules resulting in higher network accuracy. Our experiments show that CFC-CapsNet achieves competitive accuracy, faster training and inference and uses less number of parameters on the CIFAR-10, SVHN and Fashion-MNIST datasets compared to conventional CapsNet.

Result: 在InHARD和UCF-19-Y-OCC基准测试中优于三个基线模型，特别是在复杂遮挡场景下

Conclusion: 动作识别需要基于空间理解而非统计模式识别

Abstract: For embodied agents to effectively understand and interact within the world around them, they require a nuanced comprehension of human actions grounded in physical space. Current action recognition models, often relying on RGB video, learn superficial correlations between patterns and action labels, so they struggle to capture underlying physical interaction dynamics and human poses in complex scenes. We propose a model architecture that grounds action recognition in physical space by fusing two powerful, complementary representations: V-JEPA 2's contextual, predictive world dynamics and CoMotion's explicit, occlusion-tolerant human pose data. Our model is validated on both the InHARD and UCF-19-Y-OCC benchmarks for general action recognition and high-occlusion action recognition, respectively. Our model outperforms three other baselines, especially within complex, occlusive scenes. Our findings emphasize a need for action recognition to be supported by spatial understanding instead of statistical pattern recognition.

Abstract: Modern sensing technologies have enabled the collection of unstructured point cloud data (PCD) of varying sizes, which are used to monitor the geometric accuracy of 3D objects. PCD are widely applied in advanced manufacturing processes, including additive, subtractive, and hybrid manufacturing. To ensure the consistency of analysis and avoid false alarms, preprocessing steps such as registration and mesh reconstruction are commonly applied prior to monitoring. However, these steps are error-prone, time-consuming and may introduce artifacts, potentially affecting monitoring outcomes. In this paper, we present a novel registration-free approach for monitoring PCD of complex shapes, eliminating the need for both registration and mesh reconstruction. Our proposal consists of two alternative feature learning methods and a common monitoring scheme. Feature learning methods leverage intrinsic geometric properties of the shape, captured via the Laplacian and geodesic distances. In the monitoring scheme, thresholding techniques are used to further select intrinsic features most indicative of potential out-of-control conditions. Numerical experiments and case studies highlight the effectiveness of the proposed approach in identifying different types of defects.

Method: 构建CULTIVate基准，涵盖16个国家文化活动，提供基于描述符的多维度评估框架，提出文化对齐、幻觉、夸张元素和多样性四个指标。

Result: 发现系统差异：模型对全球北方国家表现优于全球南方国家，不同T2I系统有不同失败模式，所提指标与人类判断相关性更强。

Conclusion: CULTIVate基准能有效评估T2I模型的文化忠实度，揭示模型在文化表现上的系统性偏见，所提指标优于现有文本-图像指标。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models achieve impressive photorealism by training on large-scale web data, but models inherit cultural biases and fail to depict underrepresented regions faithfully. Existing cultural benchmarks focus mainly on object-centric categories (e.g., food, attire, and architecture), overlooking the social and daily activities that more clearly reflect cultural norms. Few metrics exist for measuring cultural faithfulness. We introduce CULTIVate, a benchmark for evaluating T2I models on cross-cultural activities (e.g., greetings, dining, games, traditional dances, and cultural celebrations). CULTIVate spans 16 countries with 576 prompts and more than 19,000 images, and provides an explainable descriptor-based evaluation framework across multiple cultural dimensions, including background, attire, objects, and interactions. We propose four metrics to measure cultural alignment, hallucination, exaggerated elements, and diversity. Our findings reveal systematic disparities: models perform better for global north countries than for the global south, with distinct failure modes across T2I systems. Human studies confirm that our metrics correlate more strongly with human judgments than existing text-image metrics.

TL;DR: VMDT是首个统一的视频模态信任度评估平台，用于评估文本到视频和视频到文本模型在安全性、幻觉、公平性、隐私和对抗鲁棒性五个维度的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基础模型变得越来越复杂，确保其可信度变得至关重要，但视频模态目前缺乏全面的可信度基准。

Method: 开发VMDT平台，对7个T2V模型和19个V2T模型进行广泛评估，涵盖五个关键信任维度。

Result: 开源T2V模型无法识别有害查询并经常生成有害视频，公平性低于图像模态模型；V2T模型随规模增大不公平性和隐私风险上升，但幻觉和对抗鲁棒性改善；安全性与模型大小无关。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了开发更强大可信的视频基础模型的紧迫性，VMDT为衡量和跟踪这一目标的进展提供了系统框架。

Abstract: As foundation models become more sophisticated, ensuring their trustworthiness becomes increasingly critical; yet, unlike text and image, the video modality still lacks comprehensive trustworthiness benchmarks. We introduce VMDT (Video-Modal DecodingTrust), the first unified platform for evaluating text-to-video (T2V) and video-to-text (V2T) models across five key trustworthiness dimensions: safety, hallucination, fairness, privacy, and adversarial robustness. Through our extensive evaluation of 7 T2V models and 19 V2T models using VMDT, we uncover several significant insights. For instance, all open-source T2V models evaluated fail to recognize harmful queries and often generate harmful videos, while exhibiting higher levels of unfairness compared to image modality models. In V2T models, unfairness and privacy risks rise with scale, whereas hallucination and adversarial robustness improve -- though overall performance remains low. Uniquely, safety shows no correlation with model size, implying that factors other than scale govern current safety levels. Our findings highlight the urgent need for developing more robust and trustworthy video foundation models, and VMDT provides a systematic framework for measuring and tracking progress toward this goal.

Motivation: 在脊柱手术中，准确匹配前后位和侧位图像中的椎弓根螺钉对于成功的手术至关重要，特别是在侧位视图中建立螺钉对应关系仍然是一个显著的临床挑战。

Method: 通过比较螺钉组合，并采用螺钉CAD 3D模型进行2D-3D配准，从双视图准确配对和估计螺钉姿态。

Result: 在所有测试案例中，正确的螺钉组合始终优于不正确的配对，即使在配准前也是如此。配准后，正确组合进一步增强了投影与图像之间的对齐，显著减少了投影误差。

Conclusion: 该方法通过提供可靠的螺钉位置反馈，有望改善脊柱手术的手术效果。

Abstract: Accurate matching of pedicle screws in both anteroposterior (AP) and lateral (LAT) images is critical for successful spinal decompression and stabilization during surgery. However, establishing screw correspondence, especially in LAT views, remains a significant clinical challenge. This paper introduces a method to address pedicle screw correspondence and pose estimation from dual C-arm images. By comparing screw combinations, the approach demonstrates consistent accuracy in both pairing and registration tasks. The method also employs 2D-3D alignment with screw CAD 3D models to accurately pair and estimate screw pose from dual views. Our results show that the correct screw combination consistently outperforms incorrect pairings across all test cases, even prior to registration. After registration, the correct combination further enhances alignment between projections and images, significantly reducing projection error. This approach shows promise for improving surgical outcomes in spinal procedures by providing reliable feedback on screw positioning.

Motivation: 当前多模态推理进展主要依赖未公开数据集和专有数据合成方法，缺乏系统构建大规模视觉中心推理数据集的方法，特别是超越视觉数学的任务。

Method: 采用两阶段合成框架：规模和复杂度。利用视觉语言模型和推理大语言模型合成推理轨迹，生成包含丰富认知行为的思维链轨迹。

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal reasoning has been driven largely by undisclosed datasets and proprietary data synthesis recipes, leaving open questions about how to systematically build large-scale, vision-centric reasoning datasets, particularly for tasks that go beyond visual math. In this work, we introduce a new reasoning data generation framework spanning diverse skills and levels of complexity with over 1M high-quality synthetic vision-centric questions. The dataset also includes preference data and instruction prompts supporting both offline and online RL. Our synthesis framework proceeds in two stages: (1) scale; and (2) complexity. Reasoning traces are then synthesized through a two-stage process that leverages VLMs and reasoning LLMs, producing CoT traces for VLMs that capture the richness and diverse cognitive behaviors found in frontier reasoning models. Remarkably, we show that finetuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B on our data outperforms all open-data baselines across all evaluated vision-centric benchmarks, and even surpasses strong closed-data models such as MiMo-VL-7B-RL on V* Bench, CV-Bench and MMStar-V. Perhaps most surprising, despite being entirely vision-centric, our data transfers positively to text-only reasoning (MMLU-Pro) and audio reasoning (MMAU), demonstrating its effectiveness. Similarly, despite not containing videos or embodied visual data, we observe notable gains when evaluating on a single-evidence embodied QA benchmark (NiEH). Finally, we use our data to analyze the entire VLM post-training pipeline. Our empirical analysis highlights that (i) SFT on high-quality data with non-linear reasoning traces is essential for effective online RL, (ii) staged offline RL matches online RL's performance while reducing compute demands, and (iii) careful SFT on high quality data can substantially improve out-of-domain, cross-modality transfer.

Motivation: 超声视频分割面临数据集变异性大、运动伪影和标注数据有限等挑战，而基础模型SAM2在医学影像领域性能显著下降，现有研究主要关注架构修改，缺乏对数据特性和训练机制的系统分析。

Method: 通过三种训练范式（任务特定微调、中间适应、多任务联合训练）分析训练集大小、视频时长和增强方案的影响，设计了六种超声特定增强策略，并在五个SAM2变体和多种提示模式下进行实验。

Conclusion: 这项工作为在超声视频分析中开发高效、数据感知的SAM2适应流程提供了实证见解，强调了数据特性在模型适应中的关键作用。

Abstract: Ultrasound (US) video segmentation remains a challenging problem due to strong inter- and intra-dataset variability, motion artifacts, and limited annotated data. Although foundation models such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) demonstrate strong zero-shot and prompt-guided segmentation capabilities, their performance deteriorates substantially when transferred to medical imaging domains. Current adaptation studies mainly emphasize architectural modifications, while the influence of data characteristics and training regimes has not been systematically examined. In this study, we present a comprehensive, data-centric investigation of SAM2 adaptation for ultrasound video segmentation. We analyze how training-set size, video duration, and augmentation schemes affect adaptation performance under three paradigms: task-specific fine-tuning, intermediate adaptation, and multi-task joint training, across five SAM2 variants and multiple prompting modes. We further design six ultrasound-specific augmentations, assessing their effect relative to generic strategies. Experiments on three representative ultrasound datasets reveal that data scale and temporal context play a more decisive role than model architecture or initialization. Moreover, joint training offers an efficient compromise between modality alignment and task specialization. This work aims to provide empirical insights for developing efficient, data-aware adaptation pipelines for SAM2 in ultrasound video analysis.

Abstract: The detection of clinically significant prostate cancer lesions (csPCa) from biparametric magnetic resonance imaging (bp-MRI) has emerged as a noninvasive imaging technique for improving accurate diagnosis. Nevertheless, the analysis of such images remains highly dependent on the subjective expert interpretation. Deep learning approaches have been proposed for csPCa lesions detection and segmentation, but they remain limited due to their reliance on extensively annotated datasets. Moreover, the high lesion variability across prostate zones poses additional challenges, even for expert radiologists. This work introduces a second-order geometric attention (SOGA) mechanism that guides a dedicated segmentation network, through skip connections, to detect csPCa lesions. The proposed attention is modeled on the Riemannian manifold, learning from symmetric positive definitive (SPD) representations. The proposed mechanism was integrated into standard U-Net and nnU-Net backbones, and was validated on the publicly available PI-CAI dataset, achieving an Average Precision (AP) of 0.37 and an Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.83, outperforming baseline networks and attention-based methods. Furthermore, the approach was evaluated on the Prostate158 dataset as an independent test cohort, achieving an AP of 0.37 and an AUC-ROC of 0.75, confirming robust generalization and suggesting discriminative learned representations.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation for medical image segmentation remains a significant challenge due to substantial domain shifts across imaging modalities, such as CT and MRI. While recent vision-language representation learning methods have shown promise, their potential in UDA segmentation tasks remains underexplored. To address this gap, we propose TCSA-UDA, a Text-driven Cross-Semantic Alignment framework that leverages domain-invariant textual class descriptions to guide visual representation learning. Our approach introduces a vision-language covariance cosine loss to directly align image encoder features with inter-class textual semantic relations, encouraging semantically meaningful and modality-invariant feature representations. Additionally, we incorporate a prototype alignment module that aligns class-wise pixel-level feature distributions across domains using high-level semantic prototypes. This mitigates residual category-level discrepancies and enhances cross-modal consistency. Extensive experiments on challenging cross-modality cardiac, abdominal, and brain tumor segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our TCSA-UDA framework significantly reduces domain shift and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art UDA methods, establishing a new paradigm for integrating language-driven semantics into domain-adaptive medical image analysis.

Conclusion: 位置先验的整合为磁粒子成像系统矩阵校准提供了更高效和准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) is a novel medical imaging modality. One of the established methods for MPI reconstruction is based on the System Matrix (SM). However, the calibration of the SM is often time-consuming and requires repeated measurements whenever the system parameters change. Current methodologies utilize deep learning-based super-resolution (SR) techniques to expedite SM calibration; nevertheless, these strategies do not fully exploit physical prior knowledge associated with the SM, such as symmetric positional priors. Consequently, we integrated positional priors into existing frameworks for SM calibration. Underpinned by theoretical justification, we empirically validated the efficacy of incorporating positional priors through experiments involving both 2D and 3D SM SR methods.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation faces challenges due to variations in anatomical structures. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) effectively capture local features, they struggle with modeling long-range dependencies. Transformers mitigate this issue with self-attention mechanisms but lack the ability to preserve local contextual information. State-of-the-art models primarily follow an encoder-decoder architecture, achieving notable success. However, two key limitations remain: (1) Shallow layers, which are closer to the input, capture fine-grained details but suffer from information loss as data propagates through deeper layers. (2) Inefficient integration of local details and global context between the encoder and decoder stages. To address these challenges, we propose the MACMD-based decoder, which enhances attention mechanisms and facilitates channel mixing between encoder and decoder stages via skip connections. This design leverages hierarchical dilated convolutions, attention-driven modulation, and a cross channel-mixing module to capture long-range dependencies while preserving local contextual details, essential for precise medical image segmentation. We evaluated our approach using multiple transformer encoders on both binary and multi-organ segmentation tasks. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of Dice score and computational efficiency, highlighting its effectiveness in achieving accurate and robust segmentation performance.

Abstract: End-to-end text spotting aims to jointly optimize text detection and recognition within a unified framework. Despite significant progress, designing an accurate and efficient end-to-end text spotter for arbitrary-shaped text remains largely unsolved. We identify the primary bottleneck as the lack of a reliable and efficient text detection method. To address this, we propose a novel parameterized text shape method based on low-rank approximation for precise detection and a triple assignment detection head to enable fast inference. Specifically, unlike other shape representation methods that employ data-irrelevant parameterization, our data-driven approach derives a low-rank subspace directly from labeled text boundaries. To ensure this process is robust against the inherent annotation noise in this data, we utilize a specialized recovery method based on an $\ell_1$-norm formulation, which accurately reconstructs the text shape with only a few key orthogonal vectors. By exploiting the inherent shape correlation among different text contours, our method achieves consistency and compactness in shape representation. Next, the triple assignment scheme introduces a novel architecture where a deep sparse branch (for stabilized training) is used to guide the learning of an ultra-lightweight sparse branch (for accelerated inference), while a dense branch provides rich parallel supervision. Building upon these advancements, we integrate the enhanced detection module with a lightweight recognition branch to form an end-to-end text spotting framework, termed LRANet++, capable of accurately and efficiently spotting arbitrary-shaped text. Extensive experiments on several challenging benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of LRANet++ compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: The quadratic compute and memory costs of global self-attention severely limit its use in high-resolution images. Local attention reduces complexity by restricting attention to neighborhoods. Block-sparse kernels can further improve the efficiency of local attention, but conventional local attention patterns often fail to deliver significant speedups because tokens within a window are not contiguous in the 1D sequence. This work proposes a novel method for constructing windows and neighborhoods based on the Hilbert curve. Image tokens are first reordered along a Hilbert curve, and windows and neighborhoods are then formed on the reordered 1D sequence. From a block-sparse perspective, this strategy significantly increases block sparsity and can be combined with existing block-sparse kernels to improve the efficiency of 2D local attention. Experiments show that the proposed Hilbert Window Attention and Hilbert Slide Attention can accelerate window attention and slide attention by about $4\times$ and $18\times$, respectively. To assess practicality, the strategy is instantiated as the Hilbert Window Transformer and the Hilbert Neighborhood Transformer, both of which achieve end-to-end speedups with minimal accuracy loss. Overall, combining Hilbert-guided local attention with block-sparse kernels offers a general and practical approach to enhancing the efficiency of 2D local attention for images.

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) can remotely extract physiological signals from RGB video, which has many advantages in detecting heart rate, such as low cost and no invasion to patients. The existing rPPG model is usually based on the transformer module, which has low computation efficiency. Recently, the Mamba model has garnered increasing attention due to its efficient performance in natural language processing tasks, demonstrating potential as a substitute for transformer-based algorithms. However, the Mambaout model and its variants prove that the SSM module, which is the core component of the Mamba model, is unnecessary for the vision task. Therefore, we hope to prove the feasibility of using the Mambaout-based module to remotely learn the heart rate. Specifically, we propose a novel rPPG algorithm called uncomplicated and enhanced learning capability rPPG (TYrPPG). This paper introduces an innovative gated video understanding block (GVB) designed for efficient analysis of RGB videos. Based on the Mambaout structure, this block integrates 2D-CNN and 3D-CNN to enhance video understanding for analysis. In addition, we propose a comprehensive supervised loss function (CSL) to improve the model's learning capability, along with its weakly supervised variants. The experiments show that our TYrPPG can achieve state-of-the-art performance in commonly used datasets, indicating its prospects and superiority in remote heart rate estimation.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder for which early detection is critical. Handwriting-often disrupted in prodromal AD-provides a non-invasive and cost-effective window into subtle motor and cognitive decline. Existing handwriting-based AD studies, mostly relying on online trajectories and hand-crafted features, have not systematically examined how task type influences diagnostic performance and cross-task generalization. Meanwhile, large-scale vision language models have demonstrated remarkable zero or few-shot anomaly detection in natural images and strong adaptability across medical modalities such as chest X-ray and brain MRI. However, handwriting-based disease detection remains largely unexplored within this paradigm. To close this gap, we introduce a lightweight Cross-Layer Fusion Adapter framework that repurposes CLIP for handwriting-based AD screening. CLFA implants multi-level fusion adapters within the visual encoder to progressively align representations toward handwriting-specific medical cues, enabling prompt-free and efficient zero-shot inference. Using this framework, we systematically investigate cross-task generalization-training on a specific handwriting task and evaluating on unseen ones-to reveal which task types and writing patterns most effectively discriminate AD. Extensive analyses further highlight characteristic stroke patterns and task-level factors that contribute to early AD identification, offering both diagnostic insights and a benchmark for handwriting-based cognitive assessment.

Abstract: Classifier-guided diffusion models have emerged as a powerful approach for conditional image generation, but they suffer from overconfident predictions during early denoising steps, causing the guidance gradient to vanish. This paper introduces two complementary contributions to address this issue. First, we propose a differentiable calibration objective based on the Smooth Expected Calibration Error (Smooth ECE), which improves classifier calibration with minimal fine-tuning and yields measurable improvements in Frechet Inception Distance (FID). Second, we develop enhanced sampling guidance methods that operate on off-the-shelf classifiers without requiring retraining. These include tilted sampling with batch-level reweighting, adaptive entropy-regularized sampling to preserve diversity, and a novel f-divergence-based sampling strategy that strengthens class-consistent guidance while maintaining mode coverage. Experiments on ImageNet 128x128 demonstrate that our divergence-regularized guidance achieves an FID of 2.13 using a ResNet-101 classifier, improving upon existing classifier-guided diffusion methods while requiring no diffusion model retraining. The results show that principled calibration and divergence-aware sampling provide practical and effective improvements for classifier-guided diffusion.

Abstract: The effective segmentation of 3D data is crucial for a wide range of industrial applications, especially for detecting subtle defects in the field of integrated circuits (IC). Ceramic package substrates (CPS), as an important electronic material, are essential in IC packaging owing to their superior physical and chemical properties. However, the complex structure and minor defects of CPS, along with the absence of a publically available dataset, significantly hinder the development of CPS surface defect detection. In this study, we construct a high-quality point cloud dataset for 3D segmentation of surface defects in CPS, i.e., CPS3D-Seg, which has the best point resolution and precision compared to existing 3D industrial datasets. CPS3D-Seg consists of 1300 point cloud samples under 20 product categories, and each sample provides accurate point-level annotations. Meanwhile, we conduct a comprehensive benchmark based on SOTA point cloud segmentation algorithms to validate the effectiveness of CPS3D-Seg. Additionally, we propose a novel 3D segmentation method based on causal inference (CINet), which quantifies potential confounders in point clouds through Structural Refine (SR) and Quality Assessment (QA) Modules. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CINet significantly outperforms existing algorithms in both mIoU and accuracy.

Conclusion: CGCE被证明是安全生成AI的实用有效解决方案，成功应用于各种现代T2I和T2V模型。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large-scale generative models have enabled the creation of high-quality images and videos, but have also raised significant safety concerns regarding the generation of unsafe content. To mitigate this, concept erasure methods have been developed to remove undesirable concepts from pre-trained models. However, existing methods remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can regenerate the erased content. Moreover, achieving robust erasure often degrades the model's generative quality for safe, unrelated concepts, creating a difficult trade-off between safety and performance. To address this challenge, we introduce Classifier-Guided Concept Erasure (CGCE), an efficient plug-and-play framework that provides robust concept erasure for diverse generative models without altering their original weights. CGCE uses a lightweight classifier operating on text embeddings to first detect and then refine prompts containing undesired concepts. This approach is highly scalable, allowing for multi-concept erasure by aggregating guidance from several classifiers. By modifying only unsafe embeddings at inference time, our method prevents harmful content generation while preserving the model's original quality on benign prompts. Extensive experiments show that CGCE achieves state-of-the-art robustness against a wide range of red-teaming attacks. Our approach also maintains high generative utility, demonstrating a superior balance between safety and performance. We showcase the versatility of CGCE through its successful application to various modern T2I and T2V models, establishing it as a practical and effective solution for safe generative AI.

Abstract: A Light Field (LF) camera consists of an additional two-dimensional array of micro-lenses placed between the main lens and sensor, compared to a conventional camera. The sensor pixels under each micro-lens receive light from a sub-aperture of the main lens. This enables the image sensor to capture both spatial information and the angular resolution of a scene point. This additional angular information is used to estimate the depth of a 3-D scene. The continuum of virtual viewpoints in light field data enables efficient depth estimation using Epipolar Line Images (EPIs) with robust occlusion handling. However, the trade-off between angular information and spatial information is very critical and depends on the focal position of the camera. To design, develop, implement, and test novel disparity-based light field depth estimation algorithms, the availability of suitable light field image datasets is essential. In this paper, a publicly available light field image dataset is introduced and thoroughly described. We have also demonstrated the effect of focal position on the disparity of a 3-D point as well as the shortcomings of the currently available light field dataset. The proposed dataset contains 285 light field images captured using a Lytro Illum LF camera and 13 synthetic LF images. The proposed dataset also comprises a synthetic dataset with similar disparity characteristics to those of a real light field camera. A real and synthetic stereo light field dataset is also created by using a mechanical gantry system and Blender. The dataset is available at https://github.com/aupendu/light-field-dataset.

Conclusion: MoEGCL通过样本级的细粒度图融合和对比学习，有效提升了多视图聚类的性能，解决了传统视图级融合的局限性。

Abstract: In recent years, the advancement of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has significantly propelled progress in Multi-View Clustering (MVC). However, existing methods face the problem of coarse-grained graph fusion. Specifically, current approaches typically generate a separate graph structure for each view and then perform weighted fusion of graph structures at the view level, which is a relatively rough strategy. To address this limitation, we present a novel Mixture of Ego-Graphs Contrastive Representation Learning (MoEGCL). It mainly consists of two modules. In particular, we propose an innovative Mixture of Ego-Graphs Fusion (MoEGF), which constructs ego graphs and utilizes a Mixture-of-Experts network to implement fine-grained fusion of ego graphs at the sample level, rather than the conventional view-level fusion. Additionally, we present the Ego Graph Contrastive Learning (EGCL) module to align the fused representation with the view-specific representation. The EGCL module enhances the representation similarity of samples from the same cluster, not merely from the same sample, further boosting fine-grained graph representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoEGCL achieves state-of-the-art results in deep multi-view clustering tasks. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/HackerHyper/MoEGCL.

Motivation: SAR图像固有的斑点噪声限制了其在高精度应用中的使用。现有深度学习方法通常使用单一网络处理整个图像，未能考虑不同空间物理特性对应的不同斑点统计特性，导致伪影、边缘模糊和纹理失真。

Method: 1. 使用小波分解将图像分离到不同频率子带；2. 针对低频部分，通过神经常微分方程将去噪建模为连续动态系统；3. 针对富含边缘和纹理的高频子带，使用增强的U-Net与可变形卷积进行噪声抑制和特征增强。

Conclusion: SAR-FAH模型通过频率自适应和异质网络设计，有效解决了SAR图像去斑中的伪影、边缘模糊和纹理失真问题，在噪声抑制和结构保持方面表现出色。

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images are inherently corrupted by speckle noise, limiting their utility in high-precision applications. While deep learning methods have shown promise in SAR despeckling, most methods employ a single unified network to process the entire image, failing to account for the distinct speckle statistics associated with different spatial physical characteristics. It often leads to artifacts, blurred edges, and texture distortion. To address these issues, we propose SAR-FAH, a frequency-adaptive heterogeneous despeckling model based on a divide-and-conquer architecture. First, wavelet decomposition is used to separate the image into frequency sub-bands carrying different intrinsic characteristics. Inspired by their differing noise characteristics, we design specialized sub-networks for different frequency components. The tailored approach leverages statistical variations across frequencies, improving edge and texture preservation while suppressing noise. Specifically, for the low-frequency part, denoising is formulated as a continuous dynamic system via neural ordinary differential equations, ensuring structural fidelity and sufficient smoothness that prevents artifacts. For high-frequency sub-bands rich in edges and textures, we introduce an enhanced U-Net with deformable convolutions for noise suppression and enhanced features. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real SAR images validate the superior performance of the proposed model in noise removal and structural preservation.

Abstract: Low-rank sparse regression models have been widely applied in the field of face recognition. To further address the challenges caused by complex occlusions and illumination variations, this paper proposes a Hybrid Second-Order Gradient Histogram based Global Low-Rank Sparse Regression (H2H-GLRSR) model. Specifically, a novel feature descriptor called the Hybrid Second-Order Gradient Histogram (H2H) is first designed to more effectively characterize the local structural features of facial images. Then, this descriptor is integrated with the Sparse Regularized Nuclear Norm based Matrix Regression (SR$\_$NMR). Moreover, a global low-rank constraint is imposed on the residual matrix, enabling the model to better capture the global correlations inherent in structured noise. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing regression-based classification approaches under challenging scenarios involving occlusions, illumination changes, and unconstrained environments.

Abstract: Understanding 3D scenes in open-world settings poses fundamental challenges for vision and robotics, particularly due to the limitations of closed-vocabulary supervision and static annotations. To address this, we propose a unified framework for Open-World 3D Scene Graph Generation with Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning, which enables generalizable and interactive 3D scene understanding. Our method integrates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with retrieval-based reasoning to support multimodal exploration and language-guided interaction. The framework comprises two key components: (1) a dynamic scene graph generation module that detects objects and infers semantic relationships without fixed label sets, and (2) a retrieval-augmented reasoning pipeline that encodes scene graphs into a vector database to support text/image-conditioned queries. We evaluate our method on 3DSSG and Replica benchmarks across four tasks-scene question answering, visual grounding, instance retrieval, and task planning-demonstrating robust generalization and superior performance in diverse environments. Our results highlight the effectiveness of combining open-vocabulary perception with retrieval-based reasoning for scalable 3D scene understanding.

Conclusion: 该方法具有强泛化能力，兼容现有QAT技术，模块化设计易于集成，能在不修改原网络架构的情况下有效提升量化模型性能。

Abstract: Despite the effectiveness of quantization-aware training (QAT) in compressing deep neural networks, its performance on multi-task architectures often degrades significantly due to task-specific feature discrepancies and gradient conflicts. To address these challenges, we propose Gradient-Aware Balanced Feature Fusion (GABFusion), which dynamically balances gradient magnitudes and fuses task-specific features in a quantization-friendly manner. We further introduce Attention Distribution Alignment (ADA), a feature-level distillation strategy tailored for quantized models. Our method demonstrates strong generalization across network architectures and QAT algorithms, with theoretical guarantees on gradient bias reduction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our strategy consistently enhances a variety of QAT methods across different network architectures and bit-widths. On PASCAL VOC and COCO datasets, the proposed approach achieves average mAP improvements of approximately 3.3% and 1.6%, respectively. When applied to YOLOv5 under 4-bit quantization, our method narrows the accuracy gap with the full-precision model to only 1.7% on VOC, showcasing its effectiveness in preserving performance under low-bit constraints. Notably, the proposed framework is modular, easy to integrate, and compatible with any existing QAT technique-enhancing the performance of quantized models without requiring modifications to the original network architecture.

Conclusion: FCCT框架提供了对LVLMs机制的系统理解，IRI技术通过精确干预特定组件和层的跨模态表示来增强视觉对象信息流，有效提升感知能力和减少幻觉，同时保持推理速度和其他基础性能。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable advancements of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), the mechanistic interpretability remains underexplored. Existing analyses are insufficiently comprehensive and lack examination covering visual and textual tokens, model components, and the full range of layers. This limitation restricts actionable insights to improve the faithfulness of model output and the development of downstream tasks, such as hallucination mitigation. To address this limitation, we introduce Fine-grained Cross-modal Causal Tracing (FCCT) framework, which systematically quantifies the causal effects on visual object perception. FCCT conducts fine-grained analysis covering the full range of visual and textual tokens, three core model components including multi-head self-attention (MHSA), feed-forward networks (FFNs), and hidden states, across all decoder layers. Our analysis is the first to demonstrate that MHSAs of the last token in middle layers play a critical role in aggregating cross-modal information, while FFNs exhibit a three-stage hierarchical progression for the storage and transfer of visual object representations. Building on these insights, we propose Intermediate Representation Injection (IRI), a training-free inference-time technique that reinforces visual object information flow by precisely intervening on cross-modal representations at specific components and layers, thereby enhancing perception and mitigating hallucination. Consistent improvements across five widely used benchmarks and LVLMs demonstrate IRI achieves state-of-the-art performance, while preserving inference speed and other foundational performance.

Motivation: MAE及其变体采用随机掩码需要更多预训练周期，且ViT在MAE中由于各层固定空间分辨率导致参数使用效率低下。

Method: 提出互补掩码自编码器(CoMA)确保像素均匀采样，以及分层视觉变换器DyViT采用动态多窗口自注意力(DM-MSA)减少参数和计算量。

Conclusion: CoMA和DyViT的组合实现了更有效的学习，显著提升了预训练效率，同时保持了下游任务的优秀性能。

Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAE) achieve self-supervised learning of image representations by randomly removing a portion of visual tokens and reconstructing the original image as a pretext task, thereby significantly enhancing pretraining efficiency and yielding excellent adaptability across downstream tasks. However, MAE and other MAE-style paradigms that adopt random masking generally require more pre-training epochs to maintain adaptability. Meanwhile, ViT in MAE suffers from inefficient parameter use due to fixed spatial resolution across layers. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Complementary Masked Autoencoders (CoMA), which employ a complementary masking strategy to ensure uniform sampling across all pixels, thereby improving effective learning of all features and enhancing the model's adaptability. Furthermore, we introduce DyViT, a hierarchical vision transformer that employs a Dynamic Multi-Window Self-Attention (DM-MSA), significantly reducing the parameters and FLOPs while improving fine-grained feature learning. Pre-trained on ImageNet-1K with CoMA, DyViT matches the downstream performance of MAE using only 12% of the pre-training epochs, demonstrating more effective learning. It also attains a 10% reduction in pre-training time per epoch, further underscoring its superior pre-training efficiency.

Abstract: Generative modeling frameworks have emerged as an effective approach to capture high-dimensional image distributions from large datasets without requiring domain-specific knowledge, a capability essential for longitudinal disease progression modeling. Recent generative modeling approaches have attempted to capture progression by mapping images into a latent representational space and then controlling and guiding the representations to generate follow-up images from a baseline image. However, existing approaches impose constraints on distribution learning, leading to latent spaces with limited controllability to generate follow-up images without explicit supervision from subject-specific longitudinal images. In order to enable controlled movements in the latent representational space and generate progression images from a baseline image in an unsupervised manner, we introduce a conditionable Diffusion Auto-encoder framework. The explicit encoding mechanism of image-diffusion auto-encoders forms a compact latent space capturing high-level semantics, providing means to disentangle information relevant for progression. Our approach leverages this latent space to condition and apply controlled shifts to baseline representations for generating follow-up. Controllability is induced by restricting these shifts to a subspace, thereby isolating progression-related factors from subject identity-preserving components. The shifts are implicitly guided by correlating with progression attributes, without requiring subject-specific longitudinal supervision. We validate the generations through image quality metrics, volumetric progression analysis, and downstream classification in Alzheimer's disease datasets from two different sources and disease categories. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach for Alzheimer's progression modeling and longitudinal image generation.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary scene graph generation (OVSGG) extends traditional SGG by recognizing novel objects and relationships beyond predefined categories, leveraging the knowledge from pre-trained large-scale models. Existing OVSGG methods always adopt a two-stage pipeline: 1) \textit{Infusing knowledge} into large-scale models via pre-training on large datasets; 2) \textit{Transferring knowledge} from pre-trained models with fully annotated scene graphs during supervised fine-tuning. However, due to a lack of explicit interaction modeling, these methods struggle to distinguish between interacting and non-interacting instances of the same object category. This limitation induces critical issues in both stages of OVSGG: it generates noisy pseudo-supervision from mismatched objects during knowledge infusion, and causes ambiguous query matching during knowledge transfer. To this end, in this paper, we propose an inter\textbf{AC}tion-\textbf{C}entric end-to-end OVSGG framework (\textbf{ACC}) in an interaction-driven paradigm to minimize these mismatches. For \textit{interaction-centric knowledge infusion}, ACC employs a bidirectional interaction prompt for robust pseudo-supervision generation to enhance the model's interaction knowledge. For \textit{interaction-centric knowledge transfer}, ACC first adopts interaction-guided query selection that prioritizes pairing interacting objects to reduce interference from non-interacting ones. Then, it integrates interaction-consistent knowledge distillation to bolster robustness by pushing relational foreground away from the background while retaining general knowledge. Extensive experimental results on three benchmarks show that ACC achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating the potential of interaction-centric paradigms for real-world applications.

Abstract: Facial expression recognition, as a vital computer vision task, is garnering significant attention and undergoing extensive research. Although facial expression recognition algorithms demonstrate impressive performance on high-resolution images, their effectiveness tends to degrade when confronted with low-resolution images. We find it is because: 1) low-resolution images lack detail information; 2) current methods complete weak global modeling, which make it difficult to extract discriminative features. To alleviate the above issues, we proposed a novel global multiple extraction network (GME-Net) for low-resolution facial expression recognition, which incorporates 1) a hybrid attention-based local feature extraction module with attention similarity knowledge distillation to learn image details from high-resolution network; 2) a multi-scale global feature extraction module with quasi-symmetric structure to mitigate the influence of local image noise and facilitate capturing global image features. As a result, our GME-Net is capable of extracting expression-related discriminative features. Extensive experiments conducted on several widely-used datasets demonstrate that the proposed GME-Net can better recognize low-resolution facial expression and obtain superior performance than existing solutions.

Conclusion: 该方法通过将道路元素重新解释为栅格化多边形并采用实例分割框架，显著提升了高清地图感知的泛化性能。

Abstract: The perception of high-definition maps is an integral component of environmental perception in autonomous driving systems. Existing research have often focused on online construction of high-definition maps. For instance, the Maptr[9] series employ a detection-based method to output vectorized map instances parallelly in an end-to-end manner. However, despite their capability for real-time construction, detection-based methods are observed to lack robust generalizability[19], which hampers their applicability in auto-labeling systems. Therefore, aiming to improve the generalizability, we reinterpret road elements as rasterized polygons and design a concise framework based on instance segmentation. Initially, a segmentation-based transformer is employed to deliver instance masks in an end-to-end manner; succeeding this step, a Potrace-based[17] post-processing module is used to ultimately yield vectorized map elements. Quantitative results attained on the Nuscene[1] dataset substantiate the effectiveness and generaliz-ability of our method.

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is an emerging contactless physiological sensing technique that leverages subtle color variations in facial videos to estimate vital signs such as heart rate and respiratory rate. This non-invasive method has gained traction across diverse domains, including telemedicine, affective computing, driver fatigue detection, and health monitoring, owing to its scalability and convenience. Despite significant progress in remote physiological signal measurement, a crucial characteristic - the intrinsic periodicity - has often been underexplored or insufficiently modeled in previous approaches, limiting their ability to capture fine-grained temporal dynamics under real-world conditions. To bridge this gap, we propose Reperio-rPPG, a novel framework that strategically integrates Relational Convolutional Networks with a Graph Transformer to effectively capture the periodic structure inherent in physiological signals. Additionally, recognizing the limited diversity of existing rPPG datasets, we further introduce a tailored CutMix augmentation to enhance the model's generalizability. Extensive experiments conducted on three widely used benchmark datasets - PURE, UBFC-rPPG, and MMPD - demonstrate that Reperio-rPPG not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also exhibits remarkable robustness under various motion (e.g., stationary, rotation, talking, walking) and illumination conditions (e.g., nature, low LED, high LED). The code is publicly available at https://github.com/deconasser/Reperio-rPPG.

Abstract: Stereo image matching is a fundamental task in computer vision, photogrammetry and remote sensing, but there is an almost unexplored field, i.e., polygon matching, which faces the following challenges: disparity discontinuity, scale variation, training requirement, and generalization. To address the above-mentioned issues, this paper proposes a novel U(PM)$^2$: low-cost unsupervised polygon matching with pre-trained models by uniting automatically learned and handcrafted features, of which pipeline is as follows: firstly, the detector leverages the pre-trained segment anything model to obtain masks; then, the vectorizer converts the masks to polygons and graphic structure; secondly, the global matcher addresses challenges from global viewpoint changes and scale variation based on bidirectional-pyramid strategy with pre-trained LoFTR; finally, the local matcher further overcomes local disparity discontinuity and topology inconsistency of polygon matching by local-joint geometry and multi-feature matching strategy with Hungarian algorithm. We benchmark our U(PM)$^2$ on the ScanNet and SceneFlow datasets using our proposed new metric, which achieved state-of-the-art accuracy at a competitive speed and satisfactory generalization performance at low cost without any training requirement.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法通过有效选择可靠代理并指导跨模态交互，显著提升了配准的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Typical detection-free methods for image-to-point cloud registration leverage transformer-based architectures to aggregate cross-modal features and establish correspondences. However, they often struggle under challenging conditions, where noise disrupts similarity computation and leads to incorrect correspondences. Moreover, without dedicated designs, it remains difficult to effectively select informative and correlated representations across modalities, thereby limiting the robustness and accuracy of registration. To address these challenges, we propose a novel cross-modal registration framework composed of two key modules: the Iterative Agents Selection (IAS) module and the Reliable Agents Interaction (RAI) module. IAS enhances structural feature awareness with phase maps and employs reinforcement learning principles to efficiently select reliable agents. RAI then leverages these selected agents to guide cross-modal interactions, effectively reducing mismatches and improving overall robustness. Extensive experiments on the RGB-D Scenes v2 and 7-Scenes benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Few-shot multimodal industrial anomaly detection is a critical yet underexplored task, offering the ability to quickly adapt to complex industrial scenarios. In few-shot settings, insufficient training samples often fail to cover the diverse patterns present in test samples. This challenge can be mitigated by extracting structural commonality from a small number of training samples. In this paper, we propose a novel few-shot unsupervised multimodal industrial anomaly detection method based on structural commonality, CIF (Commonality In Few). To extract intra-class structural information, we employ hypergraphs, which are capable of modeling higher-order correlations, to capture the structural commonality within training samples, and use a memory bank to store this intra-class structural prior. Firstly, we design a semantic-aware hypergraph construction module tailored for single-semantic industrial images, from which we extract common structures to guide the construction of the memory bank. Secondly, we use a training-free hypergraph message passing module to update the visual features of test samples, reducing the distribution gap between test features and features in the memory bank. We further propose a hyperedge-guided memory search module, which utilizes structural information to assist the memory search process and reduce the false positive rate. Experimental results on the MVTec 3D-AD dataset and the Eyecandies dataset show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in few-shot settings.

Method: 使用DINOv2-based Medical Slice Transformer评估四种简化MRI协议：T1加权早期减影、扩散加权成像、DWI1500+T2加权、T1sub+T2加权，采用五折交叉验证和AUC分析。

Result: T1sub+T2w协议AUC为0.77±0.04，在97.5%灵敏度下特异性达19%±7%；漏诊病灶平均直径<10mm，主要为非肿块强化；外部验证AUC为0.77，88%注意力图评级良好或中等。

Conclusion: MST框架在97.5%灵敏度下能正确分流无BI-RADS≥4的病例，对比增强和非对比增强MRI分别达到19%和17%的特异性，但需进一步研究才能临床实施。

Abstract: Background: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has high sensitivity for breast cancer detection, but interpretation is time-consuming. Artificial intelligence may aid in pre-screening. Purpose: To evaluate the DINOv2-based Medical Slice Transformer (MST) for ruling out significant findings (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System [BI-RADS] >=4) in contrast-enhanced and non-contrast-enhanced abbreviated breast MRI. Materials and Methods: This institutional review board approved retrospective study included 1,847 single-breast MRI examinations (377 BI-RADS >=4) from an in-house dataset and 924 from an external validation dataset (Duke). Four abbreviated protocols were tested: T1-weighted early subtraction (T1sub), diffusion-weighted imaging with b=1500 s/mm2 (DWI1500), DWI1500+T2-weighted (T2w), and T1sub+T2w. Performance was assessed at 90%, 95%, and 97.5% sensitivity using five-fold cross-validation and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis. AUC differences were compared with the DeLong test. False negatives were characterized, and attention maps of true positives were rated in the external dataset. Results: A total of 1,448 female patients (mean age, 49 +/- 12 years) were included. T1sub+T2w achieved an AUC of 0.77 +/- 0.04; DWI1500+T2w, 0.74 +/- 0.04 (p=0.15). At 97.5% sensitivity, T1sub+T2w had the highest specificity (19% +/- 7%), followed by DWI1500+T2w (17% +/- 11%). Missed lesions had a mean diameter <10 mm at 95% and 97.5% thresholds for both T1sub and DWI1500, predominantly non-mass enhancements. External validation yielded an AUC of 0.77, with 88% of attention maps rated good or moderate. Conclusion: At 97.5% sensitivity, the MST framework correctly triaged cases without BI-RADS >=4, achieving 19% specificity for contrast-enhanced and 17% for non-contrast-enhanced MRI. Further research is warranted before clinical implementation.

Motivation: 当前自动化方法依赖资源密集型大语言模型或静态知识图谱，难以处理真实临床数据中的两个核心挑战：缺失模态（如不完整的临床背景）和特征纠缠（混合模态特定与共享信息导致次优融合和临床不忠实的幻觉发现）。

Conclusion: DiA-gnostic VLVAE通过解耦对齐实现了稳健的放射学报告生成，能够有效处理缺失模态问题并避免特征纠缠导致的临床不忠实发现。

Abstract: The integration of medical images with clinical context is essential for generating accurate and clinically interpretable radiology reports. However, current automated methods often rely on resource-heavy Large Language Models (LLMs) or static knowledge graphs and struggle with two fundamental challenges in real-world clinical data: (1) missing modalities, such as incomplete clinical context , and (2) feature entanglement, where mixed modality-specific and shared information leads to suboptimal fusion and clinically unfaithful hallucinated findings. To address these challenges, we propose the DiA-gnostic VLVAE, which achieves robust radiology reporting through Disentangled Alignment. Our framework is designed to be resilient to missing modalities by disentangling shared and modality-specific features using a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) based Vision-Language Variational Autoencoder (VLVAE). A constrained optimization objective enforces orthogonality and alignment between these latent representations to prevent suboptimal fusion. A compact LLaMA-X decoder then uses these disentangled representations to generate reports efficiently. On the IU X-Ray and MIMIC-CXR datasets, DiA has achieved competetive BLEU@4 scores of 0.266 and 0.134, respectively. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models.

In addition, we highlight open challenges and future research directions.

Abstract: In breast ultrasound images, precise lesion segmentation is essential for early diagnosis; however, low contrast, speckle noise, and unclear boundaries make this difficult. Even though deep learning models have demonstrated potential, standard convolutional architectures frequently fall short in capturing enough global context, resulting in segmentations that are anatomically inconsistent. To overcome these drawbacks, we suggest a flexible, conditional Denoising Diffusion Model that combines an enhanced UNet-based generative decoder with a Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder for global feature extraction. We introduce three primary innovations: 1) an Adaptive Conditioning Bridge (ACB) for efficient, multi-scale fusion of semantic features; 2) a novel Topological Denoising Consistency (TDC) loss component that regularizes training by penalizing structural inconsistencies during denoising; and 3) a dual-head architecture that leverages the denoising objective as a powerful regularizer, enabling a lightweight auxiliary head to perform rapid and accurate inference on smaller datasets and a noise prediction head. Our framework establishes a new state-of-the-art on public breast ultrasound datasets, achieving Dice scores of 0.96 on BUSI, 0.90 on BrEaST and 0.97 on BUS-UCLM. Comprehensive ablation studies empirically validate that the model components are critical for achieving these results and for producing segmentations that are not only accurate but also anatomically plausible.

Abstract: Articulated objects are prevalent in daily life and robotic manipulation tasks. However, compared to rigid objects, pose tracking for articulated objects remains an underexplored problem due to their inherent kinematic constraints. To address these challenges, this work proposes a novel point-pair-based pose tracking framework, termed \textbf{PPF-Tracker}. The proposed framework first performs quasi-canonicalization of point clouds in the SE(3) Lie group space, and then models articulated objects using Point Pair Features (PPF) to predict pose voting parameters by leveraging the invariance properties of SE(3). Finally, semantic information of joint axes is incorporated to impose unified kinematic constraints across all parts of the articulated object. PPF-Tracker is systematically evaluated on both synthetic datasets and real-world scenarios, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse and challenging environments. Experimental results highlight the effectiveness and robustness of PPF-Tracker in multi-frame pose tracking of articulated objects. We believe this work can foster advances in robotics, embodied intelligence, and augmented reality. Codes are available at https://github.com/mengxh20/PPFTracker.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image models have enabled a new era of creative and controllable image generation. However, generating compositional scenes with multiple subjects and attributes remains a significant challenge. To enhance user control over subject placement, several layout-guided methods have been proposed. However, these methods face numerous challenges, particularly in compositional scenes. Unintended subjects often appear outside the layouts, generated images can be out-of-distribution and contain unnatural artifacts, or attributes bleed across subjects, leading to incorrect visual outputs. In this work, we propose MALeR, a method that addresses each of these challenges. Given a text prompt and corresponding layouts, our method prevents subjects from appearing outside the given layouts while being in-distribution. Additionally, we propose a masked, attribute-aware binding mechanism that prevents attribute leakage, enabling accurate rendering of subjects with multiple attributes, even in complex compositional scenes. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation demonstrates that our method achieves superior performance in compositional accuracy, generation consistency, and attribute binding compared to previous work. MALeR is particularly adept at generating images of scenes with multiple subjects and multiple attributes per subject.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型的训练数据往往编码了社会偏见，这些偏见会在输出中体现。与人类通过上下文和社会线索解读图像不同，VLM通过统计关联处理图像，导致推理与人类推理产生分歧。

Method: 在FairFace数据集上，对32种职业使用三种不同的提示风格，系统地分析了五种开源VLM的社会偏见，同时获取预测结果和推理过程。

Result: 研究发现，有偏见的推理模式系统地导致了交叉性差异，表明在VLM部署到下游任务之前，需要将其推理与人类价值观对齐。

Conclusion: VLM的推理过程存在系统性社会偏见，这些偏见会延续到下游任务中，因此需要在部署前将VLM推理与人类价值观对齐。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed across downstream tasks, yet their training data often encode social biases that surface in outputs. Unlike humans, who interpret images through contextual and social cues, VLMs process them through statistical associations, often leading to reasoning that diverges from human reasoning. By analyzing how a VLM reasons, we can understand how inherent biases are perpetuated and can adversely affect downstream performance. To examine this gap, we systematically analyze social biases in five open-source VLMs for an occupation prediction task, on the FairFace dataset. Across 32 occupations and three different prompting styles, we elicit both predictions and reasoning. Our findings reveal that the biased reasoning patterns systematically underlie intersectional disparities, highlighting the need to align VLM reasoning with human values prior to its downstream deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像去噪对于提高图像质量同时最小化敏感信息暴露至关重要，特别是在处理大规模临床数据集时。

Method: 使用U-Net和U-Net++架构，在单GPU、标准多GPU和优化的多GPU训练配置下进行实验，采用PyTorch的DistributedDataParallel和自动混合精度技术。

Result: U-Net++在去噪性能上表现更优，优化的训练管道将训练时间减少了60%以上，比标准DataParallel快40%以上，仅有轻微精度损失。

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了结合架构设计、轻量级混淆和先进分布式训练策略在医学图像处理中的实际可行性。

Abstract: Medical image denoising is essential for improving image quality while minimizing the exposure of sensitive information, particularly when working with large-scale clinical datasets. This study explores distributed deep learning for denoising chest X-ray images from the NIH Chest X-ray14 dataset, using additive Gaussian noise as a lightweight obfuscation technique. We implement and evaluate U-Net and U-Net++ architectures under single-GPU, standard multi-GPU (DataParallel), and optimized multi-GPU training configurations using PyTorch's DistributedDataParallel (DDP) and Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP). Our results show that U-Net++ consistently delivers superior denoising performance, achieving competitive Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structured Similarity Index Method (SSIM) scores, though with less performance in Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) compared to U-Net under low and moderate noise levels. This indicates U-Net++'s enhanced structural fidelity and low perceptual similarity. Meanwhile, our optimized training pipeline reduces training time by over 60% for both models compared to single-GPU training, and outperforms standard DataParallel by over 40%, with only a minor accuracy drop for both models (trading some accuracy for speed). These findings highlight the effectiveness of software-level optimization in distributed learning for medical imaging. This work demonstrates the practical viability of combining architectural design, lightweight obfuscation, and advanced distributed training strategies to accelerate and enhance medical image processing pipelines in real-world clinical and research environments.

TL;DR: 提出OSKT方法，通过一次性知识转移解决ReID中多尺寸模型重复计算问题，使用权重链作为中间载体实现按需扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘计算中需要不同尺寸模型适应不同资源条件，传统压缩方法需要为每个学生模型单独计算，导致重复繁琐的计算负担。

Method: 提出OSKT方法，将教师模型知识整合到权重链中，当需要特定资源约束的模型时，权重链可扩展到目标尺寸而无需额外计算。

Result: OSKT显著优于现有压缩方法，具有一次性知识转移的优势，无需为每个目标模型频繁计算。

Conclusion: OSKT方法有效解决了多尺寸模型重复计算问题，在边缘计算ReID场景中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Edge computing in person re-identification (ReID) is crucial for reducing the load on central cloud servers and ensuring user privacy. Conventional compression methods for obtaining compact models require computations for each individual student model. When multiple models of varying sizes are needed to accommodate different resource conditions, this leads to repetitive and cumbersome computations. To address this challenge, we propose a novel knowledge inheritance approach named OSKT (One-Shot Knowledge Transfer), which consolidates the knowledge of the teacher model into an intermediate carrier called a weight chain. When a downstream scenario demands a model that meets specific resource constraints, this weight chain can be expanded to the target model size without additional computation. OSKT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art compression methods, with the added advantage of one-time knowledge transfer that eliminates the need for frequent computations for each target model.

Conclusion: 自监督扩散先验在时间一致性帧合成中具有强大潜力，为可访问和泛化的视频帧插值系统提供了可扩展路径。

Abstract: Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) remains a cornerstone in video enhancement, enabling temporal upscaling for tasks like slow-motion rendering, frame rate conversion, and video restoration. While classical methods rely on optical flow and learning-based models assume access to dense ground-truth, both struggle with occlusions, domain shifts, and ambiguous motion. This article introduces MiVID, a lightweight, self-supervised, diffusion-based framework for video interpolation. Our model eliminates the need for explicit motion estimation by combining a 3D U-Net backbone with transformer-style temporal attention, trained under a hybrid masking regime that simulates occlusions and motion uncertainty. The use of cosine-based progressive masking and adaptive loss scheduling allows our network to learn robust spatiotemporal representations without any high-frame-rate supervision. Our framework is evaluated on UCF101-7 and DAVIS-7 datasets. MiVID is trained entirely on CPU using the datasets and 9-frame video segments, making it a low-resource yet highly effective pipeline. Despite these constraints, our model achieves optimal results at just 50 epochs, competitive with several supervised baselines.This work demonstrates the power of self-supervised diffusion priors for temporally coherent frame synthesis and provides a scalable path toward accessible and generalizable VFI systems.

Conclusion: 证明了在transformer架构中，无需专门聚合器即可获得鲁棒的全局描述符，为视觉位置识别提供了更简单有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual place recognition (VPR) is typically regarded as a specific image retrieval task, whose core lies in representing images as global descriptors. Over the past decade, dominant VPR methods (e.g., NetVLAD) have followed a paradigm that first extracts the patch features/tokens of the input image using a backbone, and then aggregates these patch features into a global descriptor via an aggregator. This backbone-plus-aggregator paradigm has achieved overwhelming dominance in the CNN era and remains widely used in transformer-based models. In this paper, however, we argue that a dedicated aggregator is not necessary in the transformer era, that is, we can obtain robust global descriptors only with the backbone. Specifically, we introduce some learnable aggregation tokens, which are prepended to the patch tokens before a particular transformer block. All these tokens will be jointly processed and interact globally via the intrinsic self-attention mechanism, implicitly aggregating useful information within the patch tokens to the aggregation tokens. Finally, we only take these aggregation tokens from the last output tokens and concatenate them as the global representation. Although implicit aggregation can provide robust global descriptors in an extremely simple manner, where and how to insert additional tokens, as well as the initialization of tokens, remains an open issue worthy of further exploration. To this end, we also propose the optimal token insertion strategy and token initialization method derived from empirical studies. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several VPR datasets with higher efficiency and ranks 1st on the MSLS challenge leaderboard.

TL;DR: 提出了S2ML框架，通过空间域和频域的相互学习来提升深度补全精度，在NYU-Depth V2和SUN RGB-D数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB-D相机捕获的原始深度图像常因弱反射、边界阴影和伪影导致深度值不完整，现有方法在图像域进行深度补全但忽略了原始深度图像的物理特性。

Method: 提出空间-频谱相互学习框架(S2ML)，设计了专门的频谱融合模块处理振幅和相位谱的不同特性，在统一嵌入空间中计算空间域和频域特征的局部和全局相关性。

Result: 在NYU-Depth V2和SUN RGB-D数据集上分别比最先进方法CFormer提升0.828 dB和0.834 dB。

Conclusion: S2ML框架能够充分利用空间域和频域的互补物理特性和先验知识，实现更准确的深度补全。

Abstract: The raw depth images captured by RGB-D cameras using Time-of-Flight (TOF) or structured light often suffer from incomplete depth values due to weak reflections, boundary shadows, and artifacts, which limit their applications in downstream vision tasks. Existing methods address this problem through depth completion in the image domain, but they overlook the physical characteristics of raw depth images. It has been observed that the presence of invalid depth areas alters the frequency distribution pattern. In this work, we propose a Spatio-Spectral Mutual Learning framework (S2ML) to harmonize the advantages of both spatial and frequency domains for depth completion. Specifically, we consider the distinct properties of amplitude and phase spectra and devise a dedicated spectral fusion module. Meanwhile, the local and global correlations between spatial-domain and frequency-domain features are calculated in a unified embedding space. The gradual mutual representation and refinement encourage the network to fully explore complementary physical characteristics and priors for more accurate depth completion. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed S2ML method, outperforming the state-of-the-art method CFormer by 0.828 dB and 0.834 dB on the NYU-Depth V2 and SUN RGB-D datasets, respectively.

TL;DR: StreamSTGS是一种用于实时流式自由视点视频的新表示方法，通过将3D高斯属性编码为2D图像和视频，显著压缩数据量，支持自适应码率控制，在保持竞争力的同时将平均帧大小降至170KB。

Motivation: 解决现有基于3D高斯泼溅的自由视点视频方法存储需求过高（每帧可达10MB），无法实现实时流式传输的问题。

Conclusion: StreamSTGS实现了实时流式自由视点视频，支持自适应码率控制，在压缩效率和渲染质量方面都表现出色。

Abstract: Streaming free-viewpoint video~(FVV) in real-time still faces significant challenges, particularly in training, rendering, and transmission efficiency. Harnessing superior performance of 3D Gaussian Splatting~(3DGS), recent 3DGS-based FVV methods have achieved notable breakthroughs in both training and rendering. However, the storage requirements of these methods can reach up to $10$MB per frame, making stream FVV in real-time impossible. To address this problem, we propose a novel FVV representation, dubbed StreamSTGS, designed for real-time streaming. StreamSTGS represents a dynamic scene using canonical 3D Gaussians, temporal features, and a deformation field. For high compression efficiency, we encode canonical Gaussian attributes as 2D images and temporal features as a video. This design not only enables real-time streaming, but also inherently supports adaptive bitrate control based on network condition without any extra training. Moreover, we propose a sliding window scheme to aggregate adjacent temporal features to learn local motions, and then introduce a transformer-guided auxiliary training module to learn global motions. On diverse FVV benchmarks, StreamSTGS demonstrates competitive performance on all metrics compared to state-of-the-art methods. Notably, StreamSTGS increases the PSNR by an average of $1$dB while reducing the average frame size to just $170$KB. The code is publicly available on https://github.com/kkkzh/StreamSTGS.

Abstract: We introduce Neodragon, a text-to-video system capable of generating 2s (49 frames @24 fps) videos at the 640x1024 resolution directly on a Qualcomm Hexagon NPU in a record 6.7s (7 FPS). Differing from existing transformer-based offline text-to-video generation models, Neodragon is the first to have been specifically optimised for mobile hardware to achieve efficient and high-fidelity video synthesis. We achieve this through four key technical contributions: (1) Replacing the original large 4.762B T5xxl Text-Encoder with a much smaller 0.2B DT5 (DistilT5) with minimal quality loss, enabled through a novel Text-Encoder Distillation procedure. (2) Proposing an Asymmetric Decoder Distillation approach allowing us to replace the native codec-latent-VAE decoder with a more efficient one, without disturbing the generative latent-space of the generation pipeline. (3) Pruning of MMDiT blocks within the denoiser backbone based on their relative importance, with recovery of original performance through a two-stage distillation process. (4) Reducing the NFE (Neural Functional Evaluation) requirement of the denoiser by performing step distillation using DMD adapted for pyramidal flow-matching, thereby substantially accelerating video generation. When paired with an optimised SSD1B first-frame image generator and QuickSRNet for 2x super-resolution, our end-to-end Neodragon system becomes a highly parameter (4.945B full model), memory (3.5GB peak RAM usage), and runtime (6.7s E2E latency) efficient mobile-friendly model, while achieving a VBench total score of 81.61. By enabling low-cost, private, and on-device text-to-video synthesis, Neodragon democratizes AI-based video content creation, empowering creators to generate high-quality videos without reliance on cloud services.

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，LoopExpose在曝光校正和融合性能上优于现有的最先进无监督方法。

Conclusion: LoopExpose通过伪标签和自监督约束实现了有效的无监督曝光校正，解决了对标注数据的依赖问题。

Abstract: Exposure correction is essential for enhancing image quality under challenging lighting conditions. While supervised learning has achieved significant progress in this area, it relies heavily on large-scale labeled datasets, which are difficult to obtain in practical scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a pseudo label-based unsupervised method called LoopExpose for arbitrary-length exposure correction. A nested loop optimization strategy is proposed to address the exposure correction problem, where the correction model and pseudo-supervised information are jointly optimized in a two-level framework. Specifically, the upper-level trains a correction model using pseudo-labels generated through multi-exposure fusion at the lower level. A feedback mechanism is introduced where corrected images are fed back into the fusion process to refine the pseudo-labels, creating a self-reinforcing learning loop. Considering the dominant role of luminance calibration in exposure correction, a Luminance Ranking Loss is introduced to leverage the relative luminance ordering across the input sequence as a self-supervised constraint. Extensive experiments on different benchmark datasets demonstrate that LoopExpose achieves superior exposure correction and fusion performance, outperforming existing state-of-the-art unsupervised methods.

Motivation: 运动模糊严重影响场景文本图像的可读性，传统去模糊方法难以处理空间变化模糊和长距离依赖关系，限制了计算机视觉任务的可靠性。

Method: 采用CNN编码器-解码器保持结构细节，结合transformer模块通过自注意力增强全局感知，使用合成模糊数据集训练，采用复合损失函数优化。

Conclusion: CNN-ViT混合设计在运动模糊场景文本恢复中表现出高效性和计算效率，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Motion blur in scene text images severely impairs readability and hinders the reliability of computer vision tasks, including autonomous driving, document digitization, and visual information retrieval. Conventional deblurring approaches are often inadequate in handling spatially varying blur and typically fall short in modeling the long-range dependencies necessary for restoring textual clarity. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a hybrid deep learning framework that combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with vision transformers (ViTs), thereby leveraging both local feature extraction and global contextual reasoning. The architecture employs a CNN-based encoder-decoder to preserve structural details, while a transformer module enhances global awareness through self-attention. Training is conducted on a curated dataset derived from TextOCR, where sharp scene-text samples are paired with synthetically blurred versions generated using realistic motion-blur kernels of multiple sizes and orientations. Model optimization is guided by a composite loss that incorporates mean absolute error (MAE), squared error (MSE), perceptual similarity, and structural similarity (SSIM). Quantitative evaluations show that the proposed method attains 32.20 dB in PSNR and 0.934 in SSIM, while remaining lightweight with 2.83 million parameters and an average inference time of 61 ms. These results highlight the effectiveness and computational efficiency of the CNN-ViT hybrid design, establishing its practicality for real-world motion-blurred scene-text restoration.

Conclusion: LFlow通过潜在空间流先验和理论推导的后验协方差，有效解决了现有流基逆问题求解器的局限性，在重建质量上取得了显著提升。

Abstract: Recent advances in inverse problem solving have increasingly adopted flow priors over diffusion models due to their ability to construct straight probability paths from noise to data, thereby enhancing efficiency in both training and inference. However, current flow-based inverse solvers face two primary limitations: (i) they operate directly in pixel space, which demands heavy computational resources for training and restricts scalability to high-resolution images, and (ii) they employ guidance strategies with prior-agnostic posterior covariances, which can weaken alignment with the generative trajectory and degrade posterior coverage. In this paper, we propose LFlow (Latent Refinement via Flows), a training-free framework for solving linear inverse problems via pretrained latent flow priors. LFlow leverages the efficiency of flow matching to perform ODE sampling in latent space along an optimal path. This latent formulation further allows us to introduce a theoretically grounded posterior covariance, derived from the optimal vector field, enabling effective flow guidance. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art latent diffusion solvers in reconstruction quality across most tasks.

Abstract: Real-time processing of UAV imagery is crucial for applications requiring urgent geospatial information, such as disaster response, where rapid decision-making and accurate spatial data are essential. However, processing high-resolution imagery in real time presents significant challenges due to the computational demands of feature extraction, matching, and bundle adjustment (BA). Conventional BA methods either downsample images, sacrificing important details, or require extensive processing time, making them unsuitable for time-critical missions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel real-time BA framework that operates directly on fullresolution UAV imagery without downsampling. Our lightweight, onboard-compatible approach divides each image into user-defined patches (e.g., NxN grids, default 150x150 pixels) and dynamically tracks them across frames using UAV GNSS/IMU data and a coarse, globally available digital surface model (DSM). This ensures spatial consistency for robust feature extraction and matching between patches. Overlapping relationships between images are determined in real time using UAV navigation system, enabling the rapid selection of relevant neighbouring images for localized BA. By limiting optimization to a sliding cluster of overlapping images, including those from adjacent flight strips, the method achieves real-time performance while preserving the accuracy of global BA. The proposed algorithm is designed for seamless integration into the DLR Modular Aerial Camera System (MACS), supporting largearea mapping in real time for disaster response, infrastructure monitoring, and coastal protection. Validation on MACS datasets with 50MP images demonstrates that the method maintains precise camera orientations and high-fidelity mapping across multiple strips, running full bundle adjustment in under 2 seconds without GPU acceleration.

Method: 提出基于Mamba的多尺度融合网络MambaOVSR，包含三个核心组件：全局融合模块（GFM）通过多尺度交替扫描机制进行运动建模，多尺度协同Mamba模块（MSMM）实现不同序列长度的对齐，以及MambaVR块解决对齐过程中的特征伪影和位置信息丢失问题。

Result: 在COVC数据集上的实验结果表明，MambaOVSR在PSNR指标上平均比现有最佳STVSR方法高出1.86 dB。

Conclusion: MambaOVSR有效解决了戏曲视频超分辨率中的大运动建模挑战，为古典艺术数字化保护提供了有力工具，数据集和代码将公开。

Abstract: Chinese opera is celebrated for preserving classical art. However, early filming equipment limitations have degraded videos of last-century performances by renowned artists (e.g., low frame rates and resolution), hindering archival efforts. Although space-time video super-resolution (STVSR) has advanced significantly, applying it directly to opera videos remains challenging. The scarcity of datasets impedes the recovery of high frequency details, and existing STVSR methods lack global modeling capabilities, compromising visual quality when handling opera's characteristic large motions. To address these challenges, we pioneer a large scale Chinese Opera Video Clip (COVC) dataset and propose the Mamba-based multiscale fusion network for space-time Opera Video Super-Resolution (MambaOVSR). Specifically, MambaOVSR involves three novel components: the Global Fusion Module (GFM) for motion modeling through a multiscale alternating scanning mechanism, and the Multiscale Synergistic Mamba Module (MSMM) for alignment across different sequence lengths. Additionally, our MambaVR block resolves feature artifacts and positional information loss during alignment. Experimental results on the COVC dataset show that MambaOVSR significantly outperforms the SOTA STVSR method by an average of 1.86 dB in terms of PSNR. Dataset and Code will be publicly released.

Conclusion: 该框架能够直接从文本生成高质量的3D CAD模型，代码和数据集将公开发布。

Abstract: Generating editable 3D CAD models from natural language remains challenging, as existing text-to-CAD systems either produce meshes or rely on scarce design-history data. We present NURBGen, the first framework to generate high-fidelity 3D CAD models directly from text using Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS). To achieve this, we fine-tune a large language model (LLM) to translate free-form texts into JSON representations containing NURBS surface parameters (\textit{i.e}, control points, knot vectors, degrees, and rational weights) which can be directly converted into BRep format using Python. We further propose a hybrid representation that combines untrimmed NURBS with analytic primitives to handle trimmed surfaces and degenerate regions more robustly, while reducing token complexity. Additionally, we introduce partABC, a curated subset of the ABC dataset consisting of individual CAD components, annotated with detailed captions using an automated annotation pipeline. NURBGen demonstrates strong performance on diverse prompts, surpassing prior methods in geometric fidelity and dimensional accuracy, as confirmed by expert evaluations. Code and dataset will be released publicly.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoRA是一种参数高效的微调方法，通过显式建模跨模态交互来处理多模态视觉识别中的模态缺失问题，在保持模态特定适应的同时实现双向知识转移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中多模态输入可能因隐私约束、收集困难或资源限制而缺失某些模态，现有方法未能有效捕捉跨模态关系且存在计算开销问题。

Method: 引入模态通用参数在文本和视觉编码器之间，实现双向知识转移，结合模态特定参数保持模态间交互和模态内灵活性。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，MoRA在模态缺失场景下平均性能提升5.24%，推理时间仅为SOTA方法的25.90%，可训练参数仅为全微调的0.11%。

Conclusion: MoRA在模态缺失场景下实现了更好的性能，同时显著减少了计算开销和参数需求，为多模态视觉识别提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision language models have shown remarkable performance on visual recognition tasks, but they typically assume the availability of complete multimodal inputs during both training and inference. In real-world scenarios, however, modalities may be missing due to privacy constraints, collection difficulties, or resource limitations. While previous approaches have addressed this challenge using prompt learning techniques, they fail to capture the cross-modal relationships necessary for effective multimodal visual recognition and suffer from inevitable computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce MoRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that explicitly models cross-modal interactions while maintaining modality-specific adaptations. MoRA introduces modality-common parameters between text and vision encoders, enabling bidirectional knowledge transfer. Additionally, combined with the modality-specific parameters, MoRA allows the backbone model to maintain inter-modality interaction and enable intra-modality flexibility. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that MoRA achieves an average performance improvement in missing-modality scenarios by 5.24% and uses only 25.90% of the inference time compared to the SOTA method while requiring only 0.11% of trainable parameters compared to full fine-tuning.

Abstract: Event cameras offer unique advantages for vision tasks in challenging environments, yet processing asynchronous event streams remains an open challenge. While existing methods rely on specialized architectures or resource-intensive training, the potential of leveraging modern Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) pretrained on image data remains under-explored for event-based vision. To address this, we propose Temporal-Guided VFM (TGVFM), a novel framework that integrates VFMs with our temporal context fusion block seamlessly to bridge this gap. Our temporal block introduces three key components: (1) Long-Range Temporal Attention to model global temporal dependencies, (2) Dual Spatiotemporal Attention for multi-scale frame correlation, and (3) Deep Feature Guidance Mechanism to fuse semantic-temporal features. By retraining event-to-video models on real-world data and leveraging transformer-based VFMs, TGVFM preserves spatiotemporal dynamics while harnessing pretrained representations. Experiments demonstrate SoTA performance across semantic segmentation, depth estimation, and object detection, with improvements of 16%, 21%, and 16% over existing methods, respectively. Overall, this work unlocks the cross-modality potential of image-based VFMs for event-based vision with temporal reasoning. Code is available at https://github.com/XiaRho/TGVFM.

Conclusion: 通过基于PDE的全局层整合数学物理原理可以增强基于深度学习的图像恢复，为计算机视觉应用中物理信息神经网络设计确立了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Motion blur, caused by relative movement between camera and scene during exposure, significantly degrades image quality and impairs downstream computer vision tasks such as object detection, tracking, and recognition in dynamic environments. While deep learning-based motion deblurring methods have achieved remarkable progress, existing approaches face fundamental challenges in capturing the long-range spatial dependencies inherent in motion blur patterns. Traditional convolutional methods rely on limited receptive fields and require extremely deep networks to model global spatial relationships. These limitations motivate the need for alternative approaches that incorporate physical priors to guide feature evolution during restoration. In this paper, we propose a progressive training framework that integrates physics-informed PDE dynamics into state-of-the-art restoration architectures. By leveraging advection-diffusion equations to model feature evolution, our approach naturally captures the directional flow characteristics of motion blur while enabling principled global spatial modeling. Our PDE-enhanced deblurring models achieve superior restoration quality with minimal overhead, adding only approximately 1\% to inference GMACs while providing consistent improvements in perceptual quality across multiple state-of-the-art architectures. Comprehensive experiments on standard motion deblurring benchmarks demonstrate that our physics-informed approach improves PSNR and SSIM significantly across four diverse architectures, including FFTformer, NAFNet, Restormer, and Stripformer. These results validate that incorporating mathematical physics principles through PDE-based global layers can enhance deep learning-based image restoration, establishing a promising direction for physics-informed neural network design in computer vision applications.

Motivation: 虽然判别模型在步态识别领域取得了显著成功，但生成模型的潜力尚未充分探索。本文旨在结合两种模型的优势来提取更鲁棒的步态特征。

Method: 提出多级条件控制策略：高层身份感知语义条件（通过判别提取器提取）指导生成身份一致的步态序列，低层视觉细节（外观和运动）被保留以增强一致性。生成的序列反过来促进判别提取器的学习。

Conclusion: CoD²框架成功结合了生成和判别模型的优势，为步态识别提供了更鲁棒的特征提取方法，并在多个数据集上验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Gait recognition offers a non-intrusive biometric solution by identifying individuals through their walking patterns. Although discriminative models have achieved notable success in this domain, the full potential of generative models remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{CoD$^2$}, a novel framework that combines the data distribution modeling capabilities of diffusion models with the semantic representation learning strengths of discriminative models to extract robust gait features. We propose a Multi-level Conditional Control strategy that incorporates both high-level identity-aware semantic conditions and low-level visual details. Specifically, the high-level condition, extracted by the discriminative extractor, guides the generation of identity-consistent gait sequences, whereas low-level visual details, such as appearance and motion, are preserved to enhance consistency. Furthermore, the generated sequences facilitate the discriminative extractor's learning, enabling it to capture more comprehensive high-level semantic features. Extensive experiments on four datasets (SUSTech1K, CCPG, GREW, and Gait3D) demonstrate that CoD$^2$ achieves state-of-the-art performance and can be seamlessly integrated with existing discriminative methods, yielding consistent improvements.

Conclusion: AdaDrive提供了一个灵活、上下文感知的框架，在不影响实时性能的前提下最大化决策准确性。

Abstract: Effectively integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into autonomous driving requires a balance between leveraging high-level reasoning and maintaining real-time efficiency. Existing approaches either activate LLMs too frequently, causing excessive computational overhead, or use fixed schedules, failing to adapt to dynamic driving conditions. To address these challenges, we propose AdaDrive, an adaptively collaborative slow-fast framework that optimally determines when and how LLMs contribute to decision-making. (1) When to activate the LLM: AdaDrive employs a novel adaptive activation loss that dynamically determines LLM invocation based on a comparative learning mechanism, ensuring activation only in complex or critical scenarios. (2) How to integrate LLM assistance: Instead of rigid binary activation, AdaDrive introduces an adaptive fusion strategy that modulates a continuous, scaled LLM influence based on scene complexity and prediction confidence, ensuring seamless collaboration with conventional planners. Through these strategies, AdaDrive provides a flexible, context-aware framework that maximizes decision accuracy without compromising real-time performance. Extensive experiments on language-grounded autonomous driving benchmarks demonstrate that AdaDrive state-of-the-art performance in terms of both driving accuracy and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: VLDrive证明了轻量级多模态语言模型在自动驾驶中的有效性，在显著减少参数的同时实现了优越的驾驶性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in language-grounded autonomous driving have been significantly promoted by the sophisticated cognition and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, current LLM-based approaches encounter critical challenges: (1) Failure analysis reveals that frequent collisions and obstructions, stemming from limitations in visual representations, remain primary obstacles to robust driving performance.

To address these limitations, we introduce VLDrive, a novel approach featuring a lightweight MLLM architecture with enhanced vision components. VLDrive achieves compact visual tokens through innovative strategies, including cycle-consistent dynamic visual pruning and memory-enhanced feature aggregation. Furthermore, we propose a distance-decoupled instruction attention mechanism to improve joint visual-linguistic feature learning, particularly for long-range visual tokens. Extensive experiments conducted in the CARLA simulator demonstrate VLDrive`s effectiveness. Notably, VLDrive achieves state-of-the-art driving performance while reducing parameters by 81% (from 7B to 1.3B), yielding substantial driving score improvements of 15.4%, 16.8%, and 7.6% at tiny, short, and long distances, respectively, in closed-loop evaluations.

Motivation: 当前最近邻检索实践依赖于手动调整特征层和距离度量，存在局限性。需要一种更稳健、语义感知的检索方法，能够在噪声环境下表现更好。

Method: 通过向查询图像添加轻量级触发补丁，弱后门网络将带有补丁的输入导向虚拟类。相似图像只需轻微偏移即可被分类为虚拟类，而不相似图像受影响较小。通过按此置信度对候选者排序实现检索。

Conclusion: TMM-NN通过重新定义邻域概念，提供了一种更语义感知的检索方法，在噪声鲁棒性和任务适应性方面优于传统距离度量方法。

Abstract: Nearest-neighbour retrieval is central to classification and explainable-AI pipelines, but current practice relies on hand-tuning feature layers and distance metrics. We propose Targeted Manifold Manipulation-Nearest Neighbour (TMM-NN), which reconceptualises retrieval by assessing how readily each sample can be nudged into a designated region of the feature manifold; neighbourhoods are defined by a sample's responsiveness to a targeted perturbation rather than absolute geometric distance. TMM-NN implements this through a lightweight, query-specific trigger patch. The patch is added to the query image, and the network is weakly ``backdoored'' so that any input with the patch is steered toward a dummy class. Images similar to the query need only a slight shift and are classified as the dummy class with high probability, while dissimilar ones are less affected. By ranking candidates by this confidence, TMM-NN retrieves the most semantically related neighbours. Robustness analysis and benchmark experiments confirm this trigger-based ranking outperforms traditional metrics under noise and across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Cross-modal retrieval is essential for interpreting cultural heritage data, but its effectiveness is often limited by incomplete or inconsistent textual descriptions, caused by historical data loss and the high cost of expert annotation. While large language models (LLMs) offer a promising solution by enriching textual descriptions, their outputs frequently suffer from hallucinations or miss visually grounded details. To address these challenges, we propose $C^3$, a data augmentation framework that enhances cross-modal retrieval performance by improving the completeness and consistency of LLM-generated descriptions. $C^3$ introduces a completeness evaluation module to assess semantic coverage using both visual cues and language-model outputs. Furthermore, to mitigate factual inconsistencies, we formulate a Markov Decision Process to supervise Chain-of-Thought reasoning, guiding consistency evaluation through adaptive query control. Experiments on the cultural heritage datasets CulTi and TimeTravel, as well as on general benchmarks MSCOCO and Flickr30K, demonstrate that $C^3$ achieves state-of-the-art performance in both fine-tuned and zero-shot settings.

Motivation: 当前扩散模型在视频生成和编辑方面取得进展，但精确的重光照控制仍未被探索。主流文本到视频模型由于文本描述光照细节的固有局限性和光照相关提示预训练不足，缺乏细粒度光照控制。高质量重光照训练数据构建也很困难。

Method: 1. 基于Unreal Engine构建RelightVideo数据集；2. 引入多平面光图像(MPLI)作为视觉提示，通过K个深度对齐平面建模3D光源位置、强度和颜色；3. 设计光图像适配器，将MPLI压缩并通过预训练视频VAE注入到视频扩散变换器中。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了视频重光照的挑战，通过视觉提示和适配器设计实现了精确可控的光照编辑，为视频后期制作提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models enable high-quality video generation and editing, but precise relighting with consistent video contents, which is critical for shaping scene atmosphere and viewer attention, remains unexplored. Mainstream text-to-video (T2V) models lack fine-grained lighting control due to text's inherent limitation in describing lighting details and insufficient pre-training on lighting-related prompts. Additionally, constructing high-quality relighting training data is challenging, as real-world controllable lighting data is scarce. To address these issues, we propose RelightMaster, a novel framework for accurate and controllable video relighting. First, we build RelightVideo, the first dataset with identical dynamic content under varying precise lighting conditions based on the Unreal Engine. Then, we introduce Multi-plane Light Image (MPLI), a novel visual prompt inspired by Multi-Plane Image (MPI). MPLI models lighting via K depth-aligned planes, representing 3D light source positions, intensities, and colors while supporting multi-source scenarios and generalizing to unseen light setups. Third, we design a Light Image Adapter that seamlessly injects MPLI into pre-trained Video Diffusion Transformers (DiT): it compresses MPLI via a pre-trained Video VAE and injects latent light features into DiT blocks, leveraging the base model's generative prior without catastrophic forgetting. Experiments show that RelightMaster generates physically plausible lighting and shadows and preserves original scene content. Demos are available at https://wkbian.github.io/Projects/RelightMaster/.

Conclusion: LaneDiffusion在中心线图学习中实现了最先进的性能，为这一任务的生成模型提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Centerline graphs, crucial for path planning in autonomous driving, are traditionally learned using deterministic methods. However, these methods often lack spatial reasoning and struggle with occluded or invisible centerlines. Generative approaches, despite their potential, remain underexplored in this domain. We introduce LaneDiffusion, a novel generative paradigm for centerline graph learning. LaneDiffusion innovatively employs diffusion models to generate lane centerline priors at the Bird's Eye View (BEV) feature level, instead of directly predicting vectorized centerlines. Our method integrates a Lane Prior Injection Module (LPIM) and a Lane Prior Diffusion Module (LPDM) to effectively construct diffusion targets and manage the diffusion process. Furthermore, vectorized centerlines and topologies are then decoded from these prior-injected BEV features. Extensive evaluations on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate that LaneDiffusion significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving improvements of 4.2%, 4.6%, 4.7%, 6.4% and 1.8% on fine-grained point-level metrics (GEO F1, TOPO F1, JTOPO F1, APLS and SDA) and 2.3%, 6.4%, 6.8% and 2.1% on segment-level metrics (IoU, mAP_cf, DET_l and TOP_ll). These results establish state-of-the-art performance in centerline graph learning, offering new insights into generative models for this task.

TL;DR: 本文提出VideoSSR框架，通过三个自监督预训练任务（异常定位、物体计数、时间拼图）从视频内在信息中自动生成高质量可验证训练数据，显著提升多模态大语言模型的视频理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频数据集复杂度跟不上MLLMs的快速发展，而人工标注高质量数据成本过高，因此探索能否利用视频内在信息自生成高质量可验证训练数据。

Method: 提出三个自监督预训练任务构建VideoSSR-30K数据集，开发VideoSSR视频自监督强化学习框架用于RLVR训练。

Result: 在17个基准测试中，涵盖四大视频领域（通用视频问答、长视频问答、时间定位、复杂推理），VideoSSR持续提升模型性能，平均改进超过5%。

Conclusion: VideoSSR为开发更先进的MLLMs视频理解能力提供了一个有效的基础框架。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has substantially advanced the video understanding capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, the rapid progress of MLLMs is outpacing the complexity of existing video datasets, while the manual annotation of new, high-quality data remains prohibitively expensive. This work investigates a pivotal question: Can the rich, intrinsic information within videos be harnessed to self-generate high-quality, verifiable training data? To investigate this, we introduce three self-supervised pretext tasks: Anomaly Grounding, Object Counting, and Temporal Jigsaw. We construct the Video Intrinsic Understanding Benchmark (VIUBench) to validate their difficulty, revealing that current state-of-the-art MLLMs struggle significantly on these tasks. Building upon these pretext tasks, we develop the VideoSSR-30K dataset and propose VideoSSR, a novel video self-supervised reinforcement learning framework for RLVR. Extensive experiments across 17 benchmarks, spanning four major video domains (General Video QA, Long Video QA, Temporal Grounding, and Complex Reasoning), demonstrate that VideoSSR consistently enhances model performance, yielding an average improvement of over 5\%. These results establish VideoSSR as a potent foundational framework for developing more advanced video understanding in MLLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/lcqysl/VideoSSR.

TL;DR: 该研究比较了放射科医生使用O-RADS v2022系统与深度学习模型在卵巢附件病变诊断中的表现，发现深度学习模型显著优于单纯放射科医生评估，而人机混合框架能进一步提升诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: O-RADS v2022系统虽然改进了附件病变的风险分层，但人工判读仍存在变异性和保守阈值问题，而深度学习模型在卵巢病变特征化方面显示出潜力，需要评估放射科医生表现并与AI模型比较，探索人机混合框架的诊断增益。

Method: 单中心回顾性队列研究，纳入227名患者的512个附件肿块图像，训练和验证了16个深度学习模型（包括DenseNets、EfficientNets、ResNets、VGGs、Xception和ViTs），并构建了整合放射科医生O-RADS评分与DL预测概率的混合模型。

Result: 放射科医生单独O-RADS评估的AUC为0.683，准确率68.0%；CNN模型AUC为0.620-0.908，准确率59.2%-86.4%；ViT16-384表现最佳，AUC 0.941，准确率87.4%；人机混合框架显著提升了CNN模型性能，但对ViT模型改善不显著。

Conclusion: 深度学习模型显著优于单纯放射科医生O-RADS v2022评估，专家评分与AI整合可获得最高诊断准确性和区分度，人机混合范式在标准化盆腔超声判读、减少假阳性和改善高风险病变检测方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Background: The 2022 update of the Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting and Data System (O-RADS) ultrasound classification refines risk stratification for adnexal lesions, yet human interpretation remains subject to variability and conservative thresholds. Concurrently, deep learning (DL) models have demonstrated promise in image-based ovarian lesion characterization. This study evaluates radiologist performance applying O-RADS v2022, compares it to leading convolutional neural network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) models, and investigates the diagnostic gains achieved by hybrid human-AI frameworks. Methods: In this single-center, retrospective cohort study, a total of 512 adnexal mass images from 227 patients (110 with at least one malignant cyst) were included. Sixteen DL models, including DenseNets, EfficientNets, ResNets, VGGs, Xception, and ViTs, were trained and validated. A hybrid model integrating radiologist O-RADS scores with DL-predicted probabilities was also built for each scheme. Results: Radiologist-only O-RADS assessment achieved an AUC of 0.683 and an overall accuracy of 68.0%. CNN models yielded AUCs of 0.620 to 0.908 and accuracies of 59.2% to 86.4%, while ViT16-384 reached the best performance, with an AUC of 0.941 and an accuracy of 87.4%. Hybrid human-AI frameworks further significantly enhanced the performance of CNN models; however, the improvement for ViT models was not statistically significant (P-value >0.05). Conclusions: DL models markedly outperform radiologist-only O-RADS v2022 assessment, and the integration of expert scores with AI yields the highest diagnostic accuracy and discrimination. Hybrid human-AI paradigms hold substantial potential to standardize pelvic ultrasound interpretation, reduce false positives, and improve detection of high-risk lesions.

Conclusion: 通过协同设计模型架构和任务复杂度，构建了高效而强大的化学领域视觉语言模型。

Abstract: While Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in general visual understanding, their application in the chemical domain has been limited, with previous works predominantly focusing on text and thus overlooking critical visual information, such as molecular structures. Current approaches that directly adopt standard VLMs for chemical tasks suffer from two primary issues: (i) computational inefficiency of processing entire chemical images with non-informative backgrounds. (ii) a narrow scope on molecular-level tasks that restricts progress in chemical reasoning. In this work, we propose \textbf{TinyChemVL}, an efficient and powerful chemical VLM that leverages visual token reduction and reaction-level tasks to improve model efficiency and reasoning capacity. Also, we propose \textbf{ChemRxn-V}, a reaction-level benchmark for assessing vision-based reaction recognition and prediction tasks. Directly predicting reaction products from molecular images poses a non-trivial challenge, as it requires models to integrate both recognition and reasoning capacities. Our results demonstrate that with only 4B parameters, TinyChemVL achieves superior performance on both molecular and reaction tasks while demonstrating faster inference and training speeds compared to existing models. Notably, TinyChemVL outperforms ChemVLM while utilizing only 1/16th of the visual tokens. This work builds efficient yet powerful VLMs for chemical domains by co-designing model architecture and task complexity.

Conclusion: 通过文本分割和图像生成增强多模态表示，能有效提升虚假信息检测性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Misinformation Detection (MMD) refers to the task of detecting social media posts involving misinformation, where the post often contains text and image modalities. However, by observing the MMD posts, we hold that the text modality may be much more informative than the image modality because the text generally describes the whole event/story of the current post but the image often presents partial scenes only. Our preliminary empirical results indicate that the image modality exactly contributes less to MMD. Upon this idea, we propose a new MMD method named RETSIMD. Specifically, we suppose that each text can be divided into several segments, and each text segment describes a partial scene that can be presented by an image. Accordingly, we split the text into a sequence of segments, and feed these segments into a pre-trained text-to-image generator to augment a sequence of images. We further incorporate two auxiliary objectives concerning text-image and image-label mutual information, and further post-train the generator over an auxiliary text-to-image generation benchmark dataset. Additionally, we propose a graph structure by defining three heuristic relationships between images, and use a graph neural network to generate the fused features. Extensive empirical results validate the effectiveness of RETSIMD.

An innovative pallet hole mapping module converts the detections into actionable spatial representations, enabling accurate pallet and pallet hole association for forklift operation. Experiments on a custom dataset augmented with real warehouse imagery show that YOLOv8 achieves high pallet and pallet hole detection accuracy, while YOLOv11, particularly under optimized configurations, offers superior precision and stable convergence. The results demonstrate the feasibility of a cost effective, retrofittable visual perception module for forklifts.

Abstract: Recent multispectral object detection methods have primarily focused on spatial-domain feature fusion based on CNNs or Transformers, while the potential of frequency-domain feature remains underexplored. In this work, we propose a novel Spatial and Frequency Feature Reconstruction method (SFFR) method, which leverages the spatial-frequency feature representation mechanisms of the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) to reconstruct complementary representations in both spatial and frequency domains prior to feature fusion. The core components of SFFR are the proposed Frequency Component Exchange KAN (FCEKAN) module and Multi-Scale Gaussian KAN (MSGKAN) module. The FCEKAN introduces an innovative selective frequency component exchange strategy that effectively enhances the complementarity and consistency of cross-modal features based on the frequency feature of RGB and IR images. The MSGKAN module demonstrates excellent nonlinear feature modeling capability in the spatial domain. By leveraging multi-scale Gaussian basis functions, it effectively captures the feature variations caused by scale changes at different UAV flight altitudes, significantly enhancing the model's adaptability and robustness to scale variations. It is experimentally validated that our proposed FCEKAN and MSGKAN modules are complementary and can effectively capture the frequency and spatial semantic features respectively for better feature fusion. Extensive experiments on the SeaDroneSee, DroneVehicle and DVTOD datasets demonstrate the superior performance and significant advantages of the proposed method in UAV multispectral object perception task.

Conclusion: PIDG方法成功地将物理约束引入3D高斯泼溅，有效提升了动态场景重建的物理准确性和泛化能力

Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), an explicit scene representation technique, has shown significant promise for dynamic novel-view synthesis from monocular video input. However, purely data-driven 3DGS often struggles to capture the diverse physics-driven motion patterns in dynamic scenes. To fill this gap, we propose Physics-Informed Deformable Gaussian Splatting (PIDG), which treats each Gaussian particle as a Lagrangian material point with time-varying constitutive parameters and is supervised by 2D optical flow via motion projection. Specifically, we adopt static-dynamic decoupled 4D decomposed hash encoding to reconstruct geometry and motion efficiently. Subsequently, we impose the Cauchy momentum residual as a physics constraint, enabling independent prediction of each particle's velocity and constitutive stress via a time-evolving material field. Finally, we further supervise data fitting by matching Lagrangian particle flow to camera-compensated optical flow, which accelerates convergence and improves generalization. Experiments on a custom physics-driven dataset as well as on standard synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate significant gains in physical consistency and monocular dynamic reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: 该方法验证了其在实践应用中的效率和适应性，支持通过简单的算子替换处理各种输入模态，无需重新训练。

Abstract: Reconstructing high-quality point clouds from images remains challenging in computer vision. Existing generative-model-based approaches, particularly diffusion-model approaches that directly learn the posterior, may suffer from inflexibility -- they require conditioning signals during training, support only a fixed number of input views, and need complete retraining for different measurements. Recent diffusion-based methods have attempted to address this by combining prior models with likelihood updates, but they rely on heuristic fixed step sizes for the likelihood update that lead to slow convergence and suboptimal reconstruction quality. We advance this line of approach by integrating our novel Forward Curvature-Matching (FCM) update method with diffusion sampling. Our method dynamically determines optimal step sizes using only forward automatic differentiation and finite-difference curvature estimates, enabling precise optimization of the likelihood update. This formulation enables high-fidelity reconstruction from both single-view and multi-view inputs, and supports various input modalities through simple operator substitution -- all without retraining. Experiments on ShapeNet and CO3D datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior reconstruction quality at matched or lower NFEs, yielding higher F-score and lower CD and EMD, validating its efficiency and adaptability for practical applications.

Abstract: Jigsaw puzzles are primarily visual objects, whose algorithmic solutions have traditionally been framed from a visual perspective. In this work, however, we explore a fundamentally different approach: solving square jigsaw puzzles using language models, without access to raw visual input. By introducing a specialized tokenizer that converts each puzzle piece into a discrete sequence of tokens, we reframe puzzle reassembly as a sequence-to-sequence prediction task. Treated as "blind" solvers, encoder-decoder transformers accurately reconstruct the original layout by reasoning over token sequences alone. Despite being deliberately restricted from accessing visual input, our models achieve state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks, often outperforming vision-based methods. These findings highlight the surprising capability of language models to solve problems beyond their native domain, and suggest that unconventional approaches can inspire promising directions for puzzle-solving research.

Conclusion: 上下文条件重建不确定性为AIGC检测提供了鲁棒且可迁移的信号。

Abstract: While context-based detectors have achieved strong generalization for AI-generated text by measuring distributional inconsistencies, image-based detectors still struggle with overfitting to generator-specific artifacts. We introduce CINEMAE, a novel paradigm for AIGC image detection that adapts the core principles of text detection methods to the visual domain. Our key insight is that Masked AutoEncoder (MAE), trained to reconstruct masked patches conditioned on visible context, naturally encodes semantic consistency expectations. We formalize this reconstruction process probabilistically, computing conditional Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL, p(masked | visible)) to quantify local semantic anomalies. By aggregating these patch-level statistics with global MAE features through learned fusion, CINEMAE achieves strong cross-generator generalization. Trained exclusively on Stable Diffusion v1.4, our method achieves over 95% accuracy on all eight unseen generators in the GenImage benchmark, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art detectors. This demonstrates that context-conditional reconstruction uncertainty provides a robust, transferable signal for AIGC detection.

Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) aims to predict sentiment from language, acoustic, and visual data in videos. However, imbalanced unimodal performance often leads to suboptimal fused representations. Existing approaches typically adopt fixed primary modality strategies to maximize dominant modality advantages, yet fail to adapt to dynamic variations in modality importance across different samples. Moreover, non-language modalities suffer from sequential redundancy and noise, degrading model performance when they serve as primary inputs. To address these issues, this paper proposes a modality optimization and dynamic primary modality selection framework (MODS). First, a Graph-based Dynamic Sequence Compressor (GDC) is constructed, which employs capsule networks and graph convolution to reduce sequential redundancy in acoustic/visual modalities. Then, we develop a sample-adaptive Primary Modality Selector (MSelector) for dynamic dominance determination. Finally, a Primary-modality-Centric Cross-Attention (PCCA) module is designed to enhance dominant modalities while facilitating cross-modal interaction. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that MODS outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance by effectively balancing modality contributions and eliminating redundant noise.

Abstract: Detailed structural and species information on individual tree level is increasingly important to support precision forestry, biodiversity conservation, and provide reference data for biomass and carbon mapping. Point clouds from airborne and ground-based laser scanning are currently the most suitable data source to rapidly derive such information at scale. Recent advancements in deep learning improved segmenting and classifying individual trees and identifying semantic tree components. However, deep learning models typically require large amounts of annotated training data which limits further improvement. Producing dense, high-quality annotations for 3D point clouds, especially in complex forests, is labor-intensive and challenging to scale. We explore strategies to reduce dependence on large annotated datasets using self-supervised and transfer learning architectures. Our objective is to improve performance across three tasks: instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and tree classification using realistic and operational training sets. Our findings indicate that combining self-supervised learning with domain adaptation significantly enhances instance segmentation compared to training from scratch (AP50 +16.98%), self-supervised learning suffices for semantic segmentation (mIoU +1.79%), and hierarchical transfer learning enables accurate classification of unseen species (Jaccard +6.07%). To simplify use and encourage uptake, we integrated the tasks into a unified framework, streamlining the process from raw point clouds to tree delineation, structural analysis, and species classification. Pretrained models reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions by ~21%. This open-source contribution aims to accelerate operational extraction of individual tree information from laser scanning point clouds to support forestry, biodiversity, and carbon mapping.

Abstract: As digital twins become central to the transformation of modern cities, accurate and structured 3D building models emerge as a key enabler of high-fidelity, updatable urban representations. These models underpin diverse applications including energy modeling, urban planning, autonomous navigation, and real-time reasoning. Despite recent advances in 3D urban modeling, most learning-based models are trained on building datasets with limited architectural diversity, which significantly undermines their generalizability across heterogeneous urban environments. To address this limitation, we present BuildingWorld, a comprehensive and structured 3D building dataset designed to bridge the gap in stylistic diversity. It encompasses buildings from geographically and architecturally diverse regions -- including North America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Oceania -- offering a globally representative dataset for urban-scale foundation modeling and analysis. Specifically, BuildingWorld provides about five million LOD2 building models collected from diverse sources, accompanied by real and simulated airborne LiDAR point clouds. This enables comprehensive research on 3D building reconstruction, detection and segmentation. Cyber City, a virtual city model, is introduced to enable the generation of unlimited training data with customized and structurally diverse point cloud distributions. Furthermore, we provide standardized evaluation metrics tailored for building reconstruction, aiming to facilitate the training, evaluation, and comparison of large-scale vision models and foundation models in structured 3D urban environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GazeVLM是一个新颖的视觉语言模型，用于图像中的多任务注视理解，包括人物检测、注视目标检测和注视物体识别。它首次将VLM应用于这些组合任务，通过融合RGB图像和HHA编码深度图，在GazeFollow和VideoAttentionTarget数据集上取得了最先进的性能。

Result: 消融研究表明，RGB图像与HHA编码深度图的融合在文本提示引导下表现最佳。GazeVLM在GazeFollow和VideoAttentionTarget数据集上取得了最先进的评估分数。

Conclusion: GazeVLM成功地将视觉语言模型应用于多任务注视理解，通过视觉和语言模态的融合显著提升了性能，为注视分析提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Gaze understanding unifies the detection of people, their gaze targets, and objects of interest into a single framework, offering critical insight into visual attention and intent estimation. Although prior research has modelled gaze cues in visual scenes, a unified system is still needed for gaze understanding using both visual and language prompts. This paper introduces GazeVLM, a novel Vision-Language Model (VLM) for multi-task gaze understanding in images, addressing person detection, gaze target detection, and gaze object identification. While other transformer-based methods exist for gaze analysis, GazeVLM represents, to our knowledge, the first application of a VLM to these combined tasks, allowing for selective execution of each task. Through the integration of visual (RGB and depth) and textual modalities, our ablation study on visual input combinations revealed that a fusion of RGB images with HHA-encoded depth maps, guided by text prompts, yields superior performance. We also introduce an object-level gaze detection metric for gaze object identification ($AP_{ob}$). Through experiments, GazeVLM demonstrates significant improvements, notably achieving state-of-the-art evaluation scores on GazeFollow and VideoAttentionTarget datasets.

*Guolong Wang,Heng Huang,Zhiqiang Zhang,Wentian Li,Feilong Ma,Xin Jin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了AesTest基准测试，用于评估多模态大语言模型的美学感知和生成能力，涵盖10个任务和多种美学查询类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像美学评估基准在感知范围上较窄，缺乏评估系统性美学生成所需的多样性。

Method: 构建包含10个任务的综合基准，整合专业编辑流程、摄影构图教程和众包偏好等多样化数据源，支持基于属性分析、情感共鸣、构图选择和风格推理等多种美学查询类型。

Result: 评估显示，在构建美学智能方面存在显著挑战。

Conclusion: AesTest将公开发布，以支持该领域的未来研究。

Abstract: Perceiving and producing aesthetic judgments is a fundamental yet underexplored capability for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, existing benchmarks for image aesthetic assessment (IAA) are narrow in perception scope or lack the diversity needed to evaluate systematic aesthetic production. To address this gap, we introduce AesTest, a comprehensive benchmark for multimodal aesthetic perception and production, distinguished by the following features: 1) It consists of curated multiple-choice questions spanning ten tasks, covering perception, appreciation, creation, and photography. These tasks are grounded in psychological theories of generative learning. 2) It integrates data from diverse sources, including professional editing workflows, photographic composition tutorials, and crowdsourced preferences. It ensures coverage of both expert-level principles and real-world variation. 3) It supports various aesthetic query types, such as attribute-based analysis, emotional resonance, compositional choice, and stylistic reasoning. We evaluate both instruction-tuned IAA MLLMs and general MLLMs on AesTest, revealing significant challenges in building aesthetic intelligence. We will publicly release AesTest to support future research in this area.

*Haojun Tang,Qiwei Lin,Tongda Xu,Lida Huang,Yan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: V-Shuffle是一种零样本风格迁移方法，通过打乱扩散模型中自注意力层的值特征来破坏风格图像的语义内容，同时保留低层风格表示，有效解决内容泄漏问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于注意力注入的风格迁移方法经常遭受内容泄漏问题，即风格图像中不期望的语义内容错误地出现在风格化输出中。

Method: 提出V-Shuffle方法，利用同一风格域的多个风格图像，在扩散模型的自注意力层中打乱值特征来隐式破坏风格图像的语义内容，同时引入混合风格正则化来补充高层风格纹理。

Result: 实证结果表明，V-Shuffle在使用多个风格图像时表现优异，在单张风格图像应用时也优于先前的最先进方法。

Conclusion: V-Shuffle通过破坏风格图像的语义内容同时保留风格表示，有效平衡了内容保持和风格保真度之间的权衡。

Abstract: Attention injection-based style transfer has achieved remarkable progress in recent years. However, existing methods often suffer from content leakage, where the undesired semantic content of the style image mistakenly appears in the stylized output. In this paper, we propose V-Shuffle, a zero-shot style transfer method that leverages multiple style images from the same style domain to effectively navigate the trade-off between content preservation and style fidelity. V-Shuffle implicitly disrupts the semantic content of the style images by shuffling the value features within the self-attention layers of the diffusion model, thereby preserving low-level style representations. We further introduce a Hybrid Style Regularization that complements these low-level representations with high-level style textures to enhance style fidelity. Empirical results demonstrate that V-Shuffle achieves excellent performance when utilizing multiple style images. Moreover, when applied to a single style image, V-Shuffle outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 信息图被广泛用于传达复杂信息，但其情感维度因数据资源稀缺而未被充分探索。

Method: 从六个领域收集原始数据，通过预处理、文本优先方法和三种质量保证策略构建数据集；使用多模态大语言模型分析双模态，通过互惠排名融合算法生成稳健的情感和置信度。

Result: 通过用户研究验证可用性，使用复合情感一致性指数评估数据集，总体得分0.986，表明高准确性。

Conclusion: InfoAffect数据集填补了信息图情感分析的数据空白，为相关研究提供了高质量资源。

Abstract: Infographics are widely used to convey complex information, yet their affective dimensions remain underexplored due to the scarcity of data resources. We introduce a 3.5k-sample affect-annotated InfoAffect dataset, which combines textual content with real-world infographics. We first collect the raw data from six domains and aligned them via preprocessing, the accompanied-text-priority method, and three strategies to guarantee the quality and compliance. After that we construct an affect table and use it to constrain annotation. Five state-of-the-art multimodal large language models (MLLMs) then analyze both modalities, and their outputs are fused with Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) algorithm to yield robust affects and confidences. We conducted a user study with two experiments to validate usability and assess InfoAffect dataset using the Composite Affect Consistency Index (CACI), achieving an overall score of 0.986, which indicates high accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Scarf-DETR方法，通过模态无关的可变形注意力机制和伪模态丢弃策略，解决红外-可见光目标检测中模态缺失问题，在模态完整和不完整场景下均表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前红外-可见光目标检测模型在面对模态不完整数据时性能显著下降，特别是当主导模态缺失时。需要从架构兼容性角度解决模态不完整问题。

Method: 提出可插拔的Scarf Neck模块，采用模态无关的可变形注意力机制；设计伪模态丢弃训练策略，充分利用多模态信息；构建模态不完整IVOD基准测试。

Result: Scarf-DETR在模态缺失场景下表现优异，同时在标准IVOD模态完整基准测试中也达到了优越性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够灵活适应单模态或双模态场景，提高了红外-可见光目标检测系统在模态不完整情况下的鲁棒性和兼容性。

Abstract: Infrared and visible object detection (IVOD) is essential for numerous around-the-clock applications. Despite notable advancements, current IVOD models exhibit notable performance declines when confronted with incomplete modality data, particularly if the dominant modality is missing. In this paper, we take a thorough investigation on modality incomplete IVOD problem from an architecture compatibility perspective. Specifically, we propose a plug-and-play Scarf Neck module for DETR variants, which introduces a modality-agnostic deformable attention mechanism to enable the IVOD detector to flexibly adapt to any single or double modalities during training and inference. When training Scarf-DETR, we design a pseudo modality dropout strategy to fully utilize the multi-modality information, making the detector compatible and robust to both working modes of single and double modalities. Moreover, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark for the modality-incomplete IVOD task aimed at thoroughly assessing situations where the absent modality is either dominant or secondary. Our proposed Scarf-DETR not only performs excellently in missing modality scenarios but also achieves superior performances on the standard IVOD modality complete benchmarks. Our code will be available at https://github.com/YinghuiXing/Scarf-DETR.

*Zhengyu Zou,Jingfeng Li,Hao Li,Xiaolei Hou,Jinwen Hu,Jingkun Chen,Lechao Cheng,Dingwen Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VDNeRF是一种无需相机姿态信息的动态NeRF方法，能够同时恢复相机轨迹并学习动态城市场景的时空表示，在相机姿态估计和动态新视图合成方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有NeRF方法在自动驾驶和机器人感知应用中面临的挑战：难以获取准确相机姿态以及处理大规模动态环境的能力有限。

Method: 使用两个独立的NeRF模型联合重建场景：静态NeRF模型优化相机姿态和静态背景，动态NeRF模型结合3D场景流确保动态物体的准确重建；设计了有效的训练框架解决相机运动与物体运动之间的模糊性问题。

Result: 在主流的城市驾驶数据集上的广泛评估表明，VDNeRF在相机姿态估计和动态新视图合成方面超越了最先进的基于NeRF的无姿态方法。

Conclusion: VDNeRF能够在无需额外相机姿态信息或昂贵传感器数据的情况下，准确恢复相机轨迹并学习动态城市场景的时空表示，为自动驾驶和机器人感知应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) implicitly model continuous three-dimensional scenes using a set of images with known camera poses, enabling the rendering of photorealistic novel views. However, existing NeRF-based methods encounter challenges in applications such as autonomous driving and robotic perception, primarily due to the difficulty of capturing accurate camera poses and limitations in handling large-scale dynamic environments. To address these issues, we propose Vision-only Dynamic NeRF (VDNeRF), a method that accurately recovers camera trajectories and learns spatiotemporal representations for dynamic urban scenes without requiring additional camera pose information or expensive sensor data. VDNeRF employs two separate NeRF models to jointly reconstruct the scene. The static NeRF model optimizes camera poses and static background, while the dynamic NeRF model incorporates the 3D scene flow to ensure accurate and consistent reconstruction of dynamic objects. To address the ambiguity between camera motion and independent object motion, we design an effective and powerful training framework to achieve robust camera pose estimation and self-supervised decomposition of static and dynamic elements in a scene. Extensive evaluations on mainstream urban driving datasets demonstrate that VDNeRF surpasses state-of-the-art NeRF-based pose-free methods in both camera pose estimation and dynamic novel view synthesis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiMo-CLIP通过层次分解和单调性感知对比损失增强CLIP模型，解决了传统模型在处理复杂、组合式长文本描述时的局限性，在图像-文本检索任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对比视觉语言模型（如CLIP）将文本视为扁平序列，无法有效处理复杂、组合式和长文本描述，特别是无法捕捉语言的语义层次结构和语义单调性。

Method: 提出HiMo-CLIP框架，包含两个关键组件：层次分解模块（HiDe）通过批内PCA提取潜在语义组件，实现多粒度语义对齐；单调性感知对比损失（MoLo）联合对齐全局和组件级表示，鼓励模型学习语义排序和对齐强度。

Result: 在多个图像-文本检索基准测试中，HiMo-CLIP始终优于强基线模型，特别是在处理长文本或组合式描述时表现突出。

Conclusion: HiMo-CLIP能够生成结构化、认知对齐的跨模态表示，有效提升了CLIP类模型处理复杂语言描述的能力。

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models like CLIP have achieved impressive results in image-text retrieval by aligning image and text representations in a shared embedding space. However, these models often treat text as flat sequences, limiting their ability to handle complex, compositional, and long-form descriptions. In particular, they fail to capture two essential properties of language: semantic hierarchy, which reflects the multi-level compositional structure of text, and semantic monotonicity, where richer descriptions should result in stronger alignment with visual content.To address these limitations, we propose HiMo-CLIP, a representation-level framework that enhances CLIP-style models without modifying the encoder architecture. HiMo-CLIP introduces two key components: a hierarchical decomposition (HiDe) module that extracts latent semantic components from long-form text via in-batch PCA, enabling flexible, batch-aware alignment across different semantic granularities, and a monotonicity-aware contrastive loss (MoLo) that jointly aligns global and component-level representations, encouraging the model to internalize semantic ordering and alignment strength as a function of textual completeness.These components work in concert to produce structured, cognitively-aligned cross-modal representations. Experiments on multiple image-text retrieval benchmarks show that HiMo-CLIP consistently outperforms strong baselines, particularly under long or compositional descriptions. The code is available at https://github.com/UnicomAI/HiMo-CLIP.

*Tao Liu,Kan Ren,Qian Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DiffusionUavLoc框架，通过训练无关的几何渲染合成伪卫星图像作为结构提示，设计无文本条件扩散模型融合多模态结构线索，解决无人机在GNSS拒绝环境中的跨视角定位问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着低空经济发展，无人机在智能巡检系统中成为关键平台，但在GNSS拒绝环境中，仅依赖卫星信号的定位方案容易失效。跨视角图像检索定位是可行替代方案，但无人机倾斜视角与卫星正射影像之间存在显著的几何和外观域差距。

Method: 使用训练无关的几何渲染从无人机图像合成伪卫星图像作为结构提示，设计无文本条件扩散模型融合多模态结构线索，学习对视角变化鲁棒的特征。推理时在固定时间步t计算描述符并使用余弦相似度比较。

Result: 在University-1652和SUES-200数据集上，该方法在跨视角定位方面表现具有竞争力，特别是在University-1652的卫星到无人机定位任务中。

Conclusion: DiffusionUavLoc框架通过扩散模型和VAE统一表示，有效解决了无人机在GNSS拒绝环境中的跨视角定位问题，无需复杂网络架构、文本提示或大量标注，具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of the low-altitude economy, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become key platforms for measurement and tracking in intelligent patrol systems. However, in GNSS-denied environments, localization schemes that rely solely on satellite signals are prone to failure. Cross-view image retrieval-based localization is a promising alternative, yet substantial geometric and appearance domain gaps exist between oblique UAV views and nadir satellite orthophotos. Moreover, conventional approaches often depend on complex network architectures, text prompts, or large amounts of annotation, which hinders generalization. To address these issues, we propose DiffusionUavLoc, a cross-view localization framework that is image-prompted, text-free, diffusion-centric, and employs a VAE for unified representation. We first use training-free geometric rendering to synthesize pseudo-satellite images from UAV imagery as structural prompts. We then design a text-free conditional diffusion model that fuses multimodal structural cues to learn features robust to viewpoint changes. At inference, descriptors are computed at a fixed time step t and compared using cosine similarity. On University-1652 and SUES-200, the method performs competitively for cross-view localization, especially for satellite-to-drone in University-1652.Our data and code will be published at the following URL: https://github.com/liutao23/DiffusionUavLoc.git.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了两种新颖的难度感知采样策略（PISM和CMAB）来量化样本难度，并设计了分层训练框架，在六个基准数据集上验证了仅使用GRPO在难度分层样本上的优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后训练范式存在两个关键问题：缺乏可量化的难度指标来筛选样本进行后训练优化，以及未能联合优化感知和推理能力的次优后训练范式。

Method: 提出渐进式图像语义掩码（PISM）通过系统图像退化量化样本难度，交叉模态注意力平衡（CMAB）通过注意力分布分析评估跨模态交互复杂性。基于这些指标设计分层训练框架，包含GRPO-only和SFT+GRPO混合训练范式。

Result: 实验表明，在难度分层样本上应用GRPO相比传统SFT+GRPO流程具有一致优越性，表明策略性数据采样可以避免监督微调需求同时提高模型准确性。

Conclusion: 策略性难度感知采样能够有效提升多模态大语言模型的后训练效果，仅使用GRPO在难度分层样本上即可超越传统混合训练范式。

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have spurred significant progress in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. Building on the success of Deepseek-R1, researchers extended multimodal reasoning to post-training paradigms based on reinforcement learning (RL), focusing predominantly on mathematical datasets. However, existing post-training paradigms tend to neglect two critical aspects: (1) The lack of quantifiable difficulty metrics capable of strategically screening samples for post-training optimization. (2) Suboptimal post-training paradigms that fail to jointly optimize perception and reasoning capabilities. To address this gap, we propose two novel difficulty-aware sampling strategies: Progressive Image Semantic Masking (PISM) quantifies sample hardness through systematic image degradation, while Cross-Modality Attention Balance (CMAB) assesses cross-modal interaction complexity via attention distribution analysis. Leveraging these metrics, we design a hierarchical training framework that incorporates both GRPO-only and SFT+GRPO hybrid training paradigms, and evaluate them across six benchmark datasets. Experiments demonstrate consistent superiority of GRPO applied to difficulty-stratified samples compared to conventional SFT+GRPO pipelines, indicating that strategic data sampling can obviate the need for supervised fine-tuning while improving model accuracy. Our code will be released at https://github.com/qijianyu277/DifficultySampling.

Motivation: 现有多分辨率MIL方法只关注性能提升，缺乏对校准可靠性的研究，临床专家需要可信赖的诊断结果。

Method: 使用多分辨率图像，提出新颖的patch-wise损失函数学习实例潜在模式并表达不确定性，采用注意力架构和邻域patch聚合模块收集特征，通过patch级不确定性校准聚合预测。

Result: 在挑战性公共数据集上，UFC-MIL在模型校准方面表现优异，同时达到与最先进方法相当的分类准确率。

Conclusion: UFC-MIL成功模拟病理学家检查行为，提供校准的诊断预测，具有实际应用优势。

Abstract: With the increasing demand for histopathological specimen examination and diagnostic reporting, Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has received heightened research focus as a viable solution for AI-centric diagnostic aid. Recently, to improve its performance and make it work more like a pathologist, several MIL approaches based on the use of multiple-resolution images have been proposed, delivering often higher performance than those that use single-resolution images. Despite impressive recent developments of multiple-resolution MIL, previous approaches only focus on improving performance, thereby lacking research on well-calibrated MIL that clinical experts can rely on for trustworthy diagnostic results. In this study, we propose Uncertainty-Focused Calibrated MIL (UFC-MIL), which more closely mimics the pathologists' examination behaviors while providing calibrated diagnostic predictions, using multiple images with different resolutions. UFC-MIL includes a novel patch-wise loss that learns the latent patterns of instances and expresses their uncertainty for classification. Also, the attention-based architecture with a neighbor patch aggregation module collects features for the classifier. In addition, aggregated predictions are calibrated through patch-level uncertainty without requiring multiple iterative inferences, which is a key practical advantage. Against challenging public datasets, UFC-MIL shows superior performance in model calibration while achieving classification accuracy comparable to that of state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于有效秩的多模态融合框架，通过选择性融合互补特征来同时解决特征崩溃和模态崩溃问题，在动作预期任务中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态融合方法存在两种表示崩溃：特征崩溃（单个维度失去判别能力）和模态崩溃（一个主导模态压倒其他模态）。现有方法分别处理这两种问题，缺乏统一框架。

Method: 提出Rank-enhancing Token Fuser框架，利用有效秩作为量化指标，选择性融合一个模态中信息量较少的特征与另一个模态的互补特征，提升融合表示的有效秩。

Result: 在NTURGBD、UTKinect和DARai数据集上的实验表明，该方法在动作预期任务中显著优于现有最先进方法，提升幅度达3.74%。

Conclusion: 有效秩是一个有信息量的度量指标，可用于量化并应对表示崩溃问题。深度信息与RGB融合能保持表示平衡，避免模态崩溃。

Abstract: Multi-modal fusion methods often suffer from two types of representation collapse: feature collapse where individual dimensions lose their discriminative power (as measured by eigenspectra), and modality collapse where one dominant modality overwhelms the other. Applications like human action anticipation that require fusing multifarious sensor data are hindered by both feature and modality collapse. However, existing methods attempt to counter feature collapse and modality collapse separately. This is because there is no unifying framework that efficiently addresses feature and modality collapse in conjunction. In this paper, we posit the utility of effective rank as an informative measure that can be utilized to quantify and counter both the representation collapses. We propose \textit{Rank-enhancing Token Fuser}, a theoretically grounded fusion framework that selectively blends less informative features from one modality with complementary features from another modality. We show that our method increases the effective rank of the fused representation. To address modality collapse, we evaluate modality combinations that mutually increase each others' effective rank. We show that depth maintains representational balance when fused with RGB, avoiding modality collapse. We validate our method on action anticipation, where we present \texttt{R3D}, a depth-informed fusion framework. Extensive experiments on NTURGBD, UTKinect, and DARai demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods by up to 3.74\%.

Motivation: 现有遥感方法依赖昂贵的航空图像和专家标注，只能生成二值损坏图用于早期评估，而社交媒体提供的地面图像可以填补这一空白，但缺乏像素级标注数据集。

Method: 提出了实用的三阶段跨学科标注协议，使非专家标注者能够进行一致的分割标注，标注者间一致性超过70%。

Result: 基准测试了多种最先进的分割模型，发现Encoder-only Mask Transformer (EoMT)表现最佳，平均交并比(mIoU)达到80.8%。

Conclusion: 通过解锁社交媒体丰富的地面视角，为震后场景中更快、更细粒度的损坏评估铺平了道路。

Abstract: Rapid post-earthquake damage assessment is crucial for rescue and resource planning. Still, existing remote sensing methods depend on costly aerial images, expert labeling, and produce only binary damage maps for early-stage evaluation. Although ground-level images from social networks provide a valuable source to fill this gap, a large pixel-level annotated dataset for this task is still unavailable. We introduce EIDSeg, the first large-scale semantic segmentation dataset specifically for post-earthquake social media imagery. The dataset comprises 3,266 images from nine major earthquakes (2008-2023), annotated across five classes of infrastructure damage: Undamaged Building, Damaged Building, Destroyed Building, Undamaged Road, and Damaged Road. We propose a practical three-phase cross-disciplinary annotation protocol with labeling guidelines that enables consistent segmentation by non-expert annotators, achieving over 70% inter-annotator agreement. We benchmark several state-of-the-art segmentation models, identifying Encoder-only Mask Transformer (EoMT) as the top-performing method with a Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 80.8%. By unlocking social networks' rich ground-level perspective, our work paves the way for a faster, finer-grained damage assessment in the post-earthquake scenario.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于NeRF和3DGS的单目标正面修复方法在复杂360°场景中面临三大挑战：目标识别困难、严重遮挡问题以及跨视角一致性保持。

Method: 通过将2D分割蒸馏到3D空间，并利用虚拟相机视角提供上下文指导，实现精确的对象级编辑和一致的场景补全。

Result: 实验表明Inpaint360GS超越了现有基线方法，达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂360°场景的多目标修复提供了有效的解决方案，并发布了专门的数据集来支持该领域的研究。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in single-object front-facing inpainting using NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), inpainting in complex 360° scenes remains largely underexplored. This is primarily due to three key challenges: (i) identifying target objects in the 3D field of 360° environments, (ii) dealing with severe occlusions in multi-object scenes, which makes it hard to define regions to inpaint, and (iii) maintaining consistent and high-quality appearance across views effectively. To tackle these challenges, we propose Inpaint360GS, a flexible 360° editing framework based on 3DGS that supports multi-object removal and high-fidelity inpainting in 3D space. By distilling 2D segmentation into 3D and leveraging virtual camera views for contextual guidance, our method enables accurate object-level editing and consistent scene completion. We further introduce a new dataset tailored for 360° inpainting, addressing the lack of ground truth object-free scenes. Experiments demonstrate that Inpaint360GS outperforms existing baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Project page: https://dfki-av.github.io/inpaint360gs/

TL;DR: NOAH是一个评估视频大语言模型中叙事先验引起幻觉和遗漏错误的大规模基准，通过构建复合视频来系统分析模型对叙事一致性的偏好超过视觉证据的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型强调事件连续性以增强叙事连贯性，但这引入了叙事先验偏差，导致幻觉（引入不存在事件）和遗漏（抑制不符合上下文的事实事件）两种错误。

Method: 构建NOAH基准，通过将其他来源的片段插入目标视频来创建复合视频，控制语义相似度和插入位置，设计包含字幕生成和三种问答任务（存在性、时序性、叙事性）的评估框架。

Result: 实验发现：(i)大多数视频大语言模型存在叙事先验驱动的幻觉和遗漏；(ii)错误模式因架构而异，受事件相似度和插入位置影响；(iii)帧数较少时对叙事先验的依赖加剧，在事件连续性弱时放大错误。

Conclusion: NOAH是首个标准化评估视频大语言模型中叙事先验引起幻觉和遗漏的基准，为开发更可靠可信的模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Video large language models (Video LLMs) have recently achieved strong performance on tasks such as captioning, summarization, and question answering. Many models and training methods explicitly encourage continuity across events to enhance narrative coherence. While this improves fluency, it also introduces an inductive bias that prioritizes storyline consistency over strict grounding in visual evidence. We identify this bias, which we call narrative prior, as a key driver of two errors: hallucinations, where non-existent events are introduced or existing ones are misinterpreted, and omissions, where factual events are suppressed because they are misaligned with surrounding context. To systematically evaluate narrative prior-induced errors, we introduce NOAH, a large-scale benchmark that constructs composite videos by inserting clips from other sources into target videos. By varying semantic similarity and insertion position, our benchmark enables controlled and scalable analysis of narrative priors. We design one captioning task with tailored metrics and three QA tasks - Existence, Temporal, and Narrative - yielding more than 60K evaluation samples. Extensive experiments yield three key findings: (i) most Video LLMs exhibit hallucinations and omissions driven by narrative priors, (ii) the patterns of these errors vary across architectures and depend on event similarity and insertion position, and (iii) reliance on narrative priors intensifies under sampling with fewer frames, amplifying errors when event continuity is weak. We establish NOAH as the first standardized evaluation of narrative prior-induced hallucination and omission in Video LLMs, providing a foundation for developing more reliable and trustworthy models. Our benchmark and code are available at https://anonymous550520.github.io/.

Conclusion: 结合空间监督与奖励对齐推理能够以有限数据实现稳健的3D空间理解，推动多模态大语言模型向人类级视觉推理迈进。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in vision-language tasks, but they continue to struggle with spatial understanding. Existing spatial MLLMs often rely on explicit 3D inputs or architecture-specific modifications, and remain constrained by large-scale datasets or sparse supervision. To address these limitations, we introduce SpatialThinker, a 3D-aware MLLM trained with RL to integrate structured spatial grounding with multi-step reasoning. The model simulates human-like spatial perception by constructing a scene graph of task-relevant objects and spatial relations, and reasoning towards an answer via dense spatial rewards. SpatialThinker consists of two key contributions: (1) a data synthesis pipeline that generates STVQA-7K, a high-quality spatial VQA dataset, and (2) online RL with a multi-objective dense spatial reward enforcing spatial grounding. SpatialThinker-7B outperforms supervised fine-tuning and the sparse RL baseline on spatial understanding and real-world VQA benchmarks, nearly doubling the base-model gain compared to sparse RL, and surpassing GPT-4o. These results showcase the effectiveness of combining spatial supervision with reward-aligned reasoning in enabling robust 3D spatial understanding with limited data and advancing MLLMs towards human-level visual reasoning.

Conclusion: 漫画理解仍是一个未解决的挑战，但通过适当的后训练策略特别是RARL方法，可以显著提升视觉语言模型在漫画领域的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Complex visual narratives, such as comics, present a significant challenge to Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Despite excelling on natural images, VLMs often struggle with stylized line art, onomatopoeia, and densely packed multi-panel layouts. To address this gap, we introduce AI4VA-FG, the first fine-grained and comprehensive benchmark for VLM-based comic understanding. It spans tasks from foundational recognition and detection to high-level character reasoning and narrative construction, supported by dense annotations for characters, poses, and depth. Beyond that, we evaluate state-of-the-art proprietary models, including GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5, and open-source models such as Qwen2.5-VL, revealing substantial performance deficits across core tasks of our benchmarks and underscoring that comic understanding remains an unsolved challenge. To enhance VLMs' capabilities in this domain, we systematically investigate post-training strategies, including supervised fine-tuning on solutions (SFT-S), supervised fine-tuning on reasoning trajectories (SFT-R), and reinforcement learning (RL). Beyond that, inspired by the emerging "Thinking with Images" paradigm, we propose Region-Aware Reinforcement Learning (RARL) for VLMs, which trains models to dynamically attend to relevant regions through zoom-in operations. We observe that when applied to the Qwen2.5-VL model, RL and RARL yield significant gains in low-level entity recognition and high-level storyline ordering, paving the way for more accurate and efficient VLM applications in the comics domain.

Conclusion: SportR为社区提出了新的挑战，为推动多模态体育推理的未来研究提供了关键资源，突显了当前模型能力与体育智能需求之间的显著差距。

Abstract: Deeply understanding sports requires an intricate blend of fine-grained visual perception and rule-based reasoning - a challenge that pushes the limits of current multimodal models. To succeed, models must master three critical capabilities: perceiving nuanced visual details, applying abstract sport rule knowledge, and grounding that knowledge in specific visual evidence. Current sports benchmarks either cover single sports or lack the detailed reasoning chains and precise visual grounding needed to robustly evaluate these core capabilities in a multi-sport context. To address this gap, we introduce SportR, the first multi-sports large-scale benchmark designed to train and evaluate MLLMs on the fundamental reasoning required for sports intelligence. Our benchmark provides a dataset of 5,017 images and 2,101 videos. To enable granular evaluation, we structure our benchmark around a progressive hierarchy of question-answer (QA) pairs designed to probe reasoning at increasing depths - from simple infraction identification to complex penalty prediction. For the most advanced tasks requiring multi-step reasoning, such as determining penalties or explaining tactics, we provide 7,118 high-quality, human-authored Chain of Thought (CoT) annotations. In addition, our benchmark incorporates both image and video modalities and provides manual bounding box annotations to test visual grounding in the image part directly. Extensive experiments demonstrate the profound difficulty of our benchmark. State-of-the-art baseline models perform poorly on our most challenging tasks. While training on our data via Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning improves these scores, they remain relatively low, highlighting a significant gap in current model capabilities. SportR presents a new challenge for the community, providing a critical resource to drive future research in multimodal sports reasoning.

Abstract: Robotic- and computer-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS) is increasingly relying on computer vision methods for reliable instrument recognition and surgical workflow understanding. Developing such systems often requires large, well-annotated datasets, but existing resources often address isolated tasks, neglect temporal dependencies, or lack multi-center variability. We present the Surgical Procedure Phase, Keypoint, and Instrument Recognition (PhaKIR) dataset, comprising eight complete laparoscopic cholecystectomy videos recorded at three medical centers. The dataset provides frame-level annotations for three interconnected tasks: surgical phase recognition (485,875 frames), instrument keypoint estimation (19,435 frames), and instrument instance segmentation (19,435 frames). PhaKIR is, to our knowledge, the first multi-institutional dataset to jointly provide phase labels, instrument pose information, and pixel-accurate instrument segmentations, while also enabling the exploitation of temporal context since full surgical procedure sequences are available. It served as the basis for the PhaKIR Challenge as part of the Endoscopic Vision (EndoVis) Challenge at MICCAI 2024 to benchmark methods in surgical scene understanding, thereby further validating the dataset's quality and relevance. The dataset is publicly available upon request via the Zenodo platform.

Method: 提出三分支结构耦合图像融合和重建任务，设计空间-频率增强Mamba块(SFMB)增强特征提取，使用动态融合Mamba块(DFMB)进行跨分支特征融合

Result: 在六个多模态图像融合数据集上超越了大多数最先进方法

Conclusion: SFMFusion通过空间-频率增强和动态融合机制，有效解决了多模态图像融合中的关键挑战，取得了优异性能

Abstract: Multi-Modal Image Fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate complementary image information from different modalities to produce informative images. Previous deep learning-based MMIF methods generally adopt Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Transformers for feature extraction. However, these methods deliver unsatisfactory performances due to the limited receptive field of CNNs and the high computational cost of Transformers. Recently, Mamba has demonstrated a powerful potential for modeling long-range dependencies with linear complexity, providing a promising solution to MMIF. Unfortunately, Mamba lacks full spatial and frequency perceptions, which are very important for MMIF. Moreover, employing Image Reconstruction (IR) as an auxiliary task has been proven beneficial for MMIF. However, a primary challenge is how to leverage IR efficiently and effectively. To address the above issues, we propose a novel framework named Spatial-Frequency Enhanced Mamba Fusion (SFMFusion) for MMIF. More specifically, we first propose a three-branch structure to couple MMIF and IR, which can retain complete contents from source images. Then, we propose the Spatial-Frequency Enhanced Mamba Block (SFMB), which can enhance Mamba in both spatial and frequency domains for comprehensive feature extraction. Finally, we propose the Dynamic Fusion Mamba Block (DFMB), which can be deployed across different branches for dynamic feature fusion. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves better results than most state-of-the-art methods on six MMIF datasets. The source code is available at https://github.com/SunHui1216/SFMFusion.

Method: 采用几何原理框架，包含两个创新：基于共形几何代数和RANSAC的稳健3D圆中心估计器；通过弦长方差最小化恢复真实2D投影中心，利用单应性验证或准RANSAC回退解决双极小值模糊问题。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的评估表明，该框架显著优于现有方法，减少了外参估计误差，并在不同传感器和目标类型（包括自然圆形物体）上实现了稳健标定。

Conclusion: 该几何原理框架有效解决了LiDAR-相机标定中的圆形中心对应问题，提高了标定精度和鲁棒性，代码将公开以确保可复现性。

Abstract: Circular targets are widely used in LiDAR-camera extrinsic calibration due to their geometric consistency and ease of detection. However, achieving accurate 3D-2D circular center correspondence remains challenging. Existing methods often fail due to decoupled 3D fitting and erroneous 2D ellipse-center estimation. To address this, we propose a geometrically principled framework featuring two innovations: (i) a robust 3D circle center estimator based on conformal geometric algebra and RANSAC; and (ii) a chord-length variance minimization method to recover the true 2D projected center, resolving its dual-minima ambi- guity via homography validation or a quasi-RANSAC fallback. Evaluated on synthetic and real-world datasets, our framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. It reduces extrinsic estimation error and enables robust calibration across diverse sensors and target types, including natural circular objects. Our code will be publicly released for reproducibility.

Motivation: 现有的低剂量胸部CT方法通常将肺部和心血管评估视为独立任务，忽略了它们之间的生理相互作用和共享的成像生物标志物。

Method: 框架包含三个协同组件：肺部感知模块总结肺部异常，知识引导推理模块推断其心血管影响，心脏表征模块编码结构生物标志物，通过模拟临床诊断思维进行推理。

Conclusion: 这项工作为从LDCT进行心血管分析建立了一个统一且可解释的范式，弥合了基于图像的预测和基于机制的医学解释之间的差距。

Abstract: Low-dose chest computed tomography (LDCT) inherently captures both pulmonary and cardiac structures, offering a unique opportunity for joint assessment of lung and cardiovascular health. However, most existing approaches treat these domains as independent tasks, overlooking their physiological interplay and shared imaging biomarkers. We propose an Explainable Cross-Disease Reasoning Framework that enables interpretable cardiopulmonary risk assessment from a single LDCT scan. The framework introduces an agentic reasoning process that emulates clinical diagnostic thinking-first perceiving pulmonary findings, then reasoning through established medical knowledge, and finally deriving a cardiovascular judgment with explanatory rationale. It integrates three synergistic components: a pulmonary perception module that summarizes lung abnormalities, a knowledge-guided reasoning module that infers their cardiovascular implications, and a cardiac representation module that encodes structural biomarkers. Their outputs are fused to produce a holistic cardiovascular risk prediction that is both accurate and physiologically grounded. Experiments on the NLST cohort demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance for CVD screening and mortality prediction, outperforming single-disease and purely image-based baselines. Beyond quantitative gains, the framework provides human-verifiable reasoning that aligns with cardiological understanding, revealing coherent links between pulmonary abnormalities and cardiac stress mechanisms. Overall, this work establishes a unified and explainable paradigm for cardiovascular analysis from LDCT, bridging the gap between image-based prediction and mechanism-based medical interpretation.

Abstract: Urban scene reconstruction is critical for autonomous driving, enabling structured 3D representations for data synthesis and closed-loop testing. Supervised approaches rely on costly human annotations and lack scalability, while current self-supervised methods often confuse static and dynamic elements and fail to distinguish individual dynamic objects, limiting fine-grained editing. We propose DIAL-GS, a novel dynamic instance-aware reconstruction method for label-free street scenes with 4D Gaussian Splatting. We first accurately identify dynamic instances by exploiting appearance-position inconsistency between warped rendering and actual observation. Guided by instance-level dynamic perception, we employ instance-aware 4D Gaussians as the unified volumetric representation, realizing dynamic-adaptive and instance-aware reconstruction. Furthermore, we introduce a reciprocal mechanism through which identity and dynamics reinforce each other, enhancing both integrity and consistency. Experiments on urban driving scenarios show that DIAL-GS surpasses existing self-supervised baselines in reconstruction quality and instance-level editing, offering a concise yet powerful solution for urban scene modeling.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the task of unified anomaly detection and classification, which aims to simultaneously detect anomalous regions in images and identify their specific categories. Existing methods typically treat anomaly detection and classification as separate tasks, thereby neglecting their inherent correlation, limiting information sharing, and resulting in suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose UniADC, a unified anomaly detection and classification model that can effectively perform both tasks with only a few or even no anomaly images. Specifically, UniADC consists of two key components: a training-free controllable inpainting network and a multi-task discriminator. The inpainting network can synthesize anomaly images of specific categories by repainting normal regions guided by anomaly priors, and can also repaint few-shot anomaly samples to augment the available anomaly data. The multi-task discriminator is then trained on these synthesized samples, enabling precise anomaly detection and classification by aligning fine-grained image features with anomaly-category embeddings. We conduct extensive experiments on three anomaly detection and classification datasets, including MVTec-FS, MTD, and WFDD, and the results demonstrate that UniADC consistently outperforms existing methods in anomaly detection, localization, and classification.

Motivation: 跨域小样本学习中，源域数据丰富而目标域数据稀缺的严重不平衡问题阻碍了有效的表示学习。从频域视角分析发现模型容易偏向源域特定的低频知识，且目标数据稀疏阻碍了高频、跨域可泛化特征的学习。

Method: 提出FreqGRL框架：1）低频替换模块用目标域低频成分替换源任务低频成分，减少源域特定偏差；2）高频增强模块在频域直接学习高频特征；3）全局频率过滤模块抑制噪声频率，强调信息频率。

Result: 在五个标准CD-FSL基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该频域引导框架实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 频域视角为解决跨域小样本学习中的数据不平衡问题提供了有效途径，FreqGRL框架通过频域操作显著提升了跨域泛化能力。

Abstract: Cross-domain few-shot learning (CD-FSL) aims to recognize novel classes with only a few labeled examples under significant domain shifts. While recent approaches leverage a limited amount of labeled target-domain data to improve performance, the severe imbalance between abundant source data and scarce target data remains a critical challenge for effective representation learning. We present the first frequency-space perspective to analyze this issue and identify two key challenges: (1) models are easily biased toward source-specific knowledge encoded in the low-frequency components of source data, and (2) the sparsity of target data hinders the learning of high-frequency, domain-generalizable features. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{FreqGRL}, a novel CD-FSL framework that mitigates the impact of data imbalance in the frequency space. Specifically, we introduce a Low-Frequency Replacement (LFR) module that substitutes the low-frequency components of source tasks with those from the target domain to create new source tasks that better align with target characteristics, thus reducing source-specific biases and promoting generalizable representation learning. We further design a High-Frequency Enhancement (HFE) module that filters out low-frequency components and performs learning directly on high-frequency features in the frequency space to improve cross-domain generalization. Additionally, a Global Frequency Filter (GFF) is incorporated to suppress noisy or irrelevant frequencies and emphasize informative ones, mitigating overfitting risks under limited target supervision. Extensive experiments on five standard CD-FSL benchmarks demonstrate that our frequency-guided framework achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将文本派生的SEG token嵌入输入分割模型，但这种方法可能无法充分利用SAM的预训练能力。NOVO旨在通过纯视觉提示更好地桥接视觉语言模型和分割模型。

Method: 从VLM输出生成粗掩码和点提示作为视觉提示输入SAM，并引入无训练细化模块来减少视觉伪影并提升分割掩码质量。

Result: 在包含918张图像、2533个实例级掩码的RISeg基准测试中，NOVO在多个指标和模型规模上均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: NOVO在推理分割任务中表现出有效性和可扩展性，通过视觉提示成功桥接了视觉语言模型和分割模型。

Abstract: In this study, we propose NOVO (NO text, Visual-Only prompts), a novel framework that bridges vision-language models (VLMs) and segmentation models through visual-only prompts. Unlike prior approaches that feed text-derived SEG token embeddings into segmentation models, NOVO instead generates a coarse mask and point prompts from the VLM output. These visual prompts are compatible with the Segment Anything Model (SAM), preserving alignment with its pretrained capabilities. To further enhance boundary quality and enable instance-level segmentation, we introduce a training-free refinement module that reduces visual artifacts and improves the quality of segmentation masks. We also present RISeg, a new benchmark comprising 918 images, 2,533 instance-level masks, and diverse reasoning queries to evaluate this task. Experiments demonstrate that NOVO achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics and model sizes, demonstrating its effectiveness and scalability in reasoning segmentation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的主动学习动物重识别框架，通过互补聚类方法挖掘嵌入空间中结构模糊区域，仅需0.033%的标注就能显著超越现有基础模型、无监督学习和主动学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型在动物重识别的零样本性能存在显著差距，而无监督和主动学习方法在动物重识别任务中表现不佳，需要大量标注数据但标注成本高昂。

Method: 提出主动学习重识别框架，利用互补聚类方法识别嵌入空间中的结构模糊区域，挖掘信息丰富且具有代表性的样本对，通过must-link和cannot-link约束进行标注，并与无监督学习方法集成。

Conclusion: 该方法通过极少量标注（0.033%）实现了动物重识别任务的显著性能提升，为生物多样性监测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Animal Re-ID has recently gained substantial attention in the AI research community due to its high impact on biodiversity monitoring and unique research challenges arising from environmental factors. The subtle distinguishing patterns, handling new species and the inherent open-set nature make the problem even harder. To address these complexities, foundation models trained on labeled, large-scale and multi-species animal Re-ID datasets have recently been introduced to enable zero-shot Re-ID. However, our benchmarking reveals significant gaps in their zero-shot Re-ID performance for both known and unknown species. While this highlights the need for collecting labeled data in new domains, exhaustive annotation for Re-ID is laborious and requires domain expertise. Our analyses show that existing unsupervised (USL) and AL Re-ID methods underperform for animal Re-ID. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel AL Re-ID framework that leverages complementary clustering methods to uncover and target structurally ambiguous regions in the embedding space for mining pairs of samples that are both informative and broadly representative. Oracle feedback on these pairs, in the form of must-link and cannot-link constraints, facilitates a simple annotation interface, which naturally integrates with existing USL methods through our proposed constrained clustering refinement algorithm. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that, by utilizing only 0.033% of all annotations, our approach consistently outperforms existing foundational, USL and AL baselines. Specifically, we report an average improvement of 10.49%, 11.19% and 3.99% (mAP) on 13 wildlife datasets over foundational, USL and AL methods, respectively, while attaining state-of-the-art performance on each dataset. Furthermore, we also show an improvement of 11.09%, 8.2% and 2.06% for unknown individuals in an open-world setting.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in pixel-level medical image analysis, existing medical image segmentation models rarely explore medical segmentation and diagnosis tasks jointly. However, it is crucial for patients that models can provide explainable diagnoses along with medical segmentation results. In this paper, we introduce a medical vision-language task named Medical Diagnosis Segmentation (MDS), which aims to understand clinical queries for medical images and generate the corresponding segmentation masks as well as diagnostic results. To facilitate this task, we first present the Multimodal Multi-disease Medical Diagnosis Segmentation (M3DS) dataset, containing diverse multimodal multi-disease medical images paired with their corresponding segmentation masks and diagnosis chain-of-thought, created via an automated diagnosis chain-of-thought generation pipeline. Moreover, we propose Sim4Seg, a novel framework that improves the performance of diagnosis segmentation by taking advantage of the Region-Aware Vision-Language Similarity to Mask (RVLS2M) module. To improve overall performance, we investigate a test-time scaling strategy for MDS tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the baselines in both segmentation and diagnosis.

Abstract: Vision-based 3D occupancy prediction has made significant advancements, but its reliance on cameras alone struggles in challenging environments. This limitation has driven the adoption of sensor fusion, among which camera-radar fusion stands out as a promising solution due to their complementary strengths. However, the sparsity and noise of the radar data limits its effectiveness, leading to suboptimal fusion performance. In this paper, we propose REOcc, a novel camera-radar fusion network designed to enrich radar feature representations for 3D occupancy prediction. Our approach introduces two main components, a Radar Densifier and a Radar Amplifier, which refine radar features by integrating spatial and contextual information, effectively enhancing spatial density and quality. Extensive experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that REOcc achieves significant performance gains over the camera-only baseline model, particularly in dynamic object classes. These results underscore REOcc's capability to mitigate the sparsity and noise of the radar data. Consequently, radar complements camera data more effectively, unlocking the full potential of camera-radar fusion for robust and reliable 3D occupancy prediction.

Conclusion: FCBM展示了强大的适应性和灵活性，能够无缝集成新概念而无需完全重新训练。

Abstract: Concept bottleneck models (CBMs) improve neural network interpretability by introducing an intermediate layer that maps human-understandable concepts to predictions. Recent work has explored the use of vision-language models (VLMs) to automate concept selection and annotation. However, existing VLM-based CBMs typically require full model retraining when new concepts are involved, which limits their adaptability and flexibility in real-world scenarios, especially considering the rapid evolution of vision-language foundation models. To address these issues, we propose Flexible Concept Bottleneck Model (FCBM), which supports dynamic concept adaptation, including complete replacement of the original concept set. Specifically, we design a hypernetwork that generates prediction weights based on concept embeddings, allowing seamless integration of new concepts without retraining the entire model. In addition, we introduce a modified sparsemax module with a learnable temperature parameter that dynamically selects the most relevant concepts, enabling the model to focus on the most informative features. Extensive experiments on five public benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art baselines with a similar number of effective concepts. Moreover, the model generalizes well to unseen concepts with just a single epoch of fine-tuning, demonstrating its strong adaptability and flexibility.

Conclusion: AnoStyler通过文本引导的风格转换方法，有效解决了异常生成的三个关键限制，提供了一种轻量级且有效的零样本异常生成解决方案。

Abstract: Anomaly generation has been widely explored to address the scarcity of anomaly images in real-world data. However, existing methods typically suffer from at least one of the following limitations, hindering their practical deployment: (1) lack of visual realism in generated anomalies; (2) dependence on large amounts of real images; and (3) use of memory-intensive, heavyweight model architectures. To overcome these limitations, we propose AnoStyler, a lightweight yet effective method that frames zero-shot anomaly generation as text-guided style transfer. Given a single normal image along with its category label and expected defect type, an anomaly mask indicating the localized anomaly regions and two-class text prompts representing the normal and anomaly states are generated using generalizable category-agnostic procedures. A lightweight U-Net model trained with CLIP-based loss functions is used to stylize the normal image into a visually realistic anomaly image, where anomalies are localized by the anomaly mask and semantically aligned with the text prompts. Extensive experiments on the MVTec-AD and VisA datasets show that AnoStyler outperforms existing anomaly generation methods in generating high-quality and diverse anomaly images. Furthermore, using these generated anomalies helps enhance anomaly detection performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPAN提出空间投影对齐方法，通过空间点对齐和3D-2D投影对齐两个关键组件，解决单目3D检测中解耦预测范式忽略几何约束的问题，提升检测性能。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单目3D检测器采用解耦预测范式分别估计几何中心、深度、尺寸和旋转角度，但忽略了不同属性间的几何协同约束，导致缺乏几何一致性先验，性能次优。

Method: 提出空间投影对齐(SPAN)：1) 空间点对齐 - 在预测和真实3D边界框间施加显式全局空间约束；2) 3D-2D投影对齐 - 确保投影的3D框在图像平面上与其对应的2D检测框紧密对齐；3) 分层任务学习策略 - 渐进式引入空间投影对齐以防止早期错误传播。

Result: 该方法可轻松集成到任何现有单目3D检测器中，并带来显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: SPAN通过空间投影对齐有效解决了单目3D检测中几何约束缺失的问题，提高了检测的几何一致性和准确性。

Abstract: Existing monocular 3D detectors typically tame the pronounced nonlinear regression of 3D bounding box through decoupled prediction paradigm, which employs multiple branches to estimate geometric center, depth, dimensions, and rotation angle separately. Although this decoupling strategy simplifies the learning process, it inherently ignores the geometric collaborative constraints between different attributes, resulting in the lack of geometric consistency prior, thereby leading to suboptimal performance. To address this issue, we propose novel Spatial-Projection Alignment (SPAN) with two pivotal components: (i). Spatial Point Alignment enforces an explicit global spatial constraint between the predicted and ground-truth 3D bounding boxes, thereby rectifying spatial drift caused by decoupled attribute regression. (ii). 3D-2D Projection Alignment ensures that the projected 3D box is aligned tightly within its corresponding 2D detection bounding box on the image plane, mitigating projection misalignment overlooked in previous works. To ensure training stability, we further introduce a Hierarchical Task Learning strategy that progressively incorporates spatial-projection alignment as 3D attribute predictions refine, preventing early stage error propagation across attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can be easily integrated into any established monocular 3D detector and delivers significant performance improvements.

Result: 实验表明K-Stain在定量指标和视觉质量上均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 基于关键点的空间和语义关系能有效提升合成IHC图像的保真度，为虚拟染色提供了更准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Virtual staining offers a promising method for converting Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) images into Immunohistochemical (IHC) images, eliminating the need for costly chemical processes. However, existing methods often struggle to utilize spatial information effectively due to misalignment in tissue slices. To overcome this challenge, we leverage keypoints as robust indicators of spatial correspondence, enabling more precise alignment and integration of structural details in synthesized IHC images. We introduce K-Stain, a novel framework that employs keypoint-based spatial and semantic relationships to enhance synthesized IHC image fidelity. K-Stain comprises three main components: (1) a Hierarchical Spatial Keypoint Detector (HSKD) for identifying keypoints in stain images, (2) a Keypoint-aware Enhancement Generator (KEG) that integrates these keypoints during image generation, and (3) a Keypoint Guided Discriminator (KGD) that improves the discriminator's sensitivity to spatial details. Our approach leverages contextual information from adjacent slices, resulting in more accurate and visually consistent IHC images. Extensive experiments show that K-Stain outperforms state-of-the-art methods in quantitative metrics and visual quality.

Conclusion: MirrorMamba方法通过创新的Mamba架构和多线索融合，有效解决了视频镜像检测中的关键挑战，为镜像检测领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Video mirror detection has received significant research attention, yet existing methods suffer from limited performance and robustness. These approaches often over-rely on single, unreliable dynamic features, and are typically built on CNNs with limited receptive fields or Transformers with quadratic computational complexity. To address these limitations, we propose a new effective and scalable video mirror detection method, called MirrorMamba. Our approach leverages multiple cues to adapt to diverse conditions, incorporating perceived depth, correspondence and optical. We also introduce an innovative Mamba-based Multidirection Correspondence Extractor, which benefits from the global receptive field and linear complexity of the emerging Mamba spatial state model to effectively capture correspondence properties. Additionally, we design a Mamba-based layer-wise boundary enforcement decoder to resolve the unclear boundary caused by the blurred depth map. Notably, this work marks the first successful application of the Mamba-based architecture in the field of mirror detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches for video mirror detection on the benchmark datasets. Furthermore, on the most challenging and representative image-based mirror detection dataset, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, proving its robustness and generalizability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将图像压缩到2-D潜在空间时仍保留大量空间冗余，限制了压缩性能。需要更紧凑的表示形式来提升编码效率。

Method: 混合RWKV-Transformer架构：使用RWKV模块捕获窗口间全局依赖，Transformer块建模窗口内局部冗余，结合专用RWKV压缩模型处理1-D潜在特征。

Result: 在比特率低于0.02 bpp时保持优越重建质量，相比最先进的2-D架构GLC，在Kodak和CLIC2020数据集上分别节省43.75%和30.59%的比特率。

Conclusion: 1-D潜在表示比2-D表示更紧凑，混合注意力机制能有效提升极低比特率图像压缩性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in extreme image compression have revealed that mapping pixel data into highly compact latent representations can significantly improve coding efficiency. However, most existing methods compress images into 2-D latent spaces via convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or Swin Transformers, which tend to retain substantial spatial redundancy, thereby limiting overall compression performance. In this paper, we propose a novel Mixed RWKV-Transformer (MRT) architecture that encodes images into more compact 1-D latent representations by synergistically integrating the complementary strengths of linear-attention-based RWKV and self-attention-based Transformer models. Specifically, MRT partitions each image into fixed-size windows, utilizing RWKV modules to capture global dependencies across windows and Transformer blocks to model local redundancies within each window. The hierarchical attention mechanism enables more efficient and compact representation learning in the 1-D domain. To further enhance compression efficiency, we introduce a dedicated RWKV Compression Model (RCM) tailored to the structure characteristics of the intermediate 1-D latent features in MRT. Extensive experiments on standard image compression benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach. The proposed MRT framework consistently achieves superior reconstruction quality at bitrates below 0.02 bits per pixel (bpp). Quantitative results based on the DISTS metric show that MRT significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art 2-D architecture GLC, achieving bitrate savings of 43.75%, 30.59% on the Kodak and CLIC2020 test datasets, respectively.

Conclusion: 相对能量建模结合简单合成异常为开放世界自动驾驶中的可靠OOD检测提供了原则性和可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a critical requirement for reliable autonomous driving, where safety depends on recognizing road obstacles and unexpected objects beyond the training distribution. Despite extensive research on OOD detection in 2D images, direct transfer to 3D LiDAR point clouds has been proven ineffective. Current LiDAR OOD methods struggle to distinguish rare anomalies from common classes, leading to high false-positive rates and overconfident errors in safety-critical settings. We propose Relative Energy Learning (REL), a simple yet effective framework for OOD detection in LiDAR point clouds. REL leverages the energy gap between positive (in-distribution) and negative logits as a relative scoring function, mitigating calibration issues in raw energy values and improving robustness across various scenes. To address the absence of OOD samples during training, we propose a lightweight data synthesis strategy called Point Raise, which perturbs existing point clouds to generate auxiliary anomalies without altering the inlier semantics. Evaluated on SemanticKITTI and the Spotting the Unexpected (STU) benchmark, REL consistently outperforms existing methods by a large margin. Our results highlight that modeling relative energy, combined with simple synthetic outliers, provides a principled and scalable solution for reliable OOD detection in open-world autonomous driving.

Abstract: We present AvatarTex, a high-fidelity facial texture reconstruction framework capable of generating both stylized and photorealistic textures from a single image. Existing methods struggle with stylized avatars due to the lack of diverse multi-style datasets and challenges in maintaining geometric consistency in non-standard textures. To address these limitations, AvatarTex introduces a novel three-stage diffusion-to-GAN pipeline. Our key insight is that while diffusion models excel at generating diversified textures, they lack explicit UV constraints, whereas GANs provide a well-structured latent space that ensures style and topology consistency. By integrating these strengths, AvatarTex achieves high-quality topology-aligned texture synthesis with both artistic and geometric coherence. Specifically, our three-stage pipeline first completes missing texture regions via diffusion-based inpainting, refines style and structure consistency using GAN-based latent optimization, and enhances fine details through diffusion-based repainting. To address the need for a stylized texture dataset, we introduce TexHub, a high-resolution collection of 20,000 multi-style UV textures with precise UV-aligned layouts. By leveraging TexHub and our structured diffusion-to-GAN pipeline, AvatarTex establishes a new state-of-the-art in multi-style facial texture reconstruction. TexHub will be released upon publication to facilitate future research in this field.

Conclusion: Argus通过智能的近似策略选择，有效解决了文本到图像模型的高吞吐量推理挑战，在保持质量的同时显著提升了系统性能。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have gained significant popularity. Most of these are diffusion models with unique computational characteristics, distinct from both traditional small-scale ML models and large language models. They are highly compute-bound and use an iterative denoising process to generate images, leading to very high inference time. This creates significant challenges in designing a high-throughput system. We discovered that a large fraction of prompts can be served using faster, approximated models. However, the approximation setting must be carefully calibrated for each prompt to avoid quality degradation. Designing a high-throughput system that assigns each prompt to the appropriate model and compatible approximation setting remains a challenging problem. We present Argus, a high-throughput T2I inference system that selects the right level of approximation for each prompt to maintain quality while meeting throughput targets on a fixed-size cluster. Argus intelligently switches between different approximation strategies to satisfy both throughput and quality requirements. Overall, Argus achieves 10x fewer latency service-level objective (SLO) violations, 10% higher average quality, and 40% higher throughput compared to baselines on two real-world workload traces.

Abstract: Rain degrades the visual quality of multi-view images, which are essential for 3D scene reconstruction, resulting in inaccurate and incomplete reconstruction results. Existing datasets often overlook two critical characteristics of real rainy 3D scenes: the viewpoint-dependent variation in the appearance of rain streaks caused by their projection onto 2D images, and the reduction in ambient brightness resulting from cloud coverage during rainfall. To improve data realism, we construct a new dataset named OmniRain3D that incorporates perspective heterogeneity and brightness dynamicity, enabling more faithful simulation of rain degradation in 3D scenes. Based on this dataset, we propose an end-to-end reconstruction framework named REVR-GSNet (Rain Elimination and Visibility Recovery for 3D Gaussian Splatting). Specifically, REVR-GSNet integrates recursive brightness enhancement, Gaussian primitive optimization, and GS-guided rain elimination into a unified architecture through joint alternating optimization, achieving high-fidelity reconstruction of clean 3D scenes from rain-degraded inputs. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our dataset and method. Our dataset and method provide a foundation for future research on multi-view image deraining and rainy 3D scene reconstruction.

Conclusion: Otter通过复合分割和时序重建的RWKV架构，有效解决了宽视角少样本动作识别中的背景干扰和时序关系退化问题，显著提升了识别性能。

Abstract: Wide-angle videos in few-shot action recognition (FSAR) effectively express actions within specific scenarios. However, without a global understanding of both subjects and background, recognizing actions in such samples remains challenging because of the background distractions. Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV), which learns interaction between various dimensions, shows promise for global modeling. While directly applying RWKV to wide-angle FSAR may fail to highlight subjects due to excessive background information. Additionally, temporal relation degraded by frames with similar backgrounds is difficult to reconstruct, further impacting performance. Therefore, we design the CompOund SegmenTation and Temporal REconstructing RWKV (Otter). Specifically, the Compound Segmentation Module~(CSM) is devised to segment and emphasize key patches in each frame, effectively highlighting subjects against background information. The Temporal Reconstruction Module (TRM) is incorporated into the temporal-enhanced prototype construction to enable bidirectional scanning, allowing better reconstruct temporal relation. Furthermore, a regular prototype is combined with the temporal-enhanced prototype to simultaneously enhance subject emphasis and temporal modeling, improving wide-angle FSAR performance. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as SSv2, Kinetics, UCF101, and HMDB51 demonstrate that Otter achieves state-of-the-art performance. Extra evaluation on the VideoBadminton dataset further validates the superiority of Otter in wide-angle FSAR.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose PointCubeNet, a novel multi-modal 3D understanding framework that achieves part-level reasoning without requiring any part annotations. PointCubeNet comprises global and local branches. The proposed local branch, structured into 3x3x3 local blocks, enables part-level analysis of point cloud sub-regions with the corresponding local text labels. Leveraging the proposed pseudo-labeling method and local loss function, PointCubeNet is effectively trained in an unsupervised manner. The experimental results demonstrate that understanding 3D object parts enhances the understanding of the overall 3D object. In addition, this is the first attempt to perform unsupervised 3D part-level reasoning and achieves reliable and meaningful results.

Abstract: Regularized optimization has been a classical approach to solving imaging inverse problems, where the regularization term enforces desirable properties of the unknown image. Recently, the integration of flow matching generative models into image restoration has garnered significant attention, owing to their powerful prior modeling capabilities. In this work, we incorporate such generative priors into a Plug-and-Play (PnP) framework based on proximal splitting, where the proximal operator associated with the regularizer is replaced by a time-dependent denoiser derived from the generative model. While existing PnP methods have achieved notable success in inverse problems with smooth squared $\ell_2$ data fidelity--typically associated with Gaussian noise--their applicability to more general data fidelity terms remains underexplored. To address this, we propose a general and efficient PnP algorithm inspired by the primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) method. Our approach is computationally efficient, memory-friendly, and accommodates a wide range of fidelity terms. In particular, it supports both $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ norm-based losses, enabling robustness to non-Gaussian noise types such as Poisson and impulse noise. We validate our method on several image restoration tasks, including denoising, super-resolution, deblurring, and inpainting, and demonstrate that $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ fidelity terms outperform the conventional squared $\ell_2$ loss in the presence of non-Gaussian noise.

Conclusion: 这是医学多模态学习中首个解决症状到器官推理的工作，提出的框架在腹部CT图像中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Understanding symptom-image associations is crucial for clinical reasoning. However, existing medical multimodal models often rely on simple one-to-one hard labeling, oversimplifying clinical reality where symptoms relate to multiple organs. In addition, they mainly use single-slice 2D features without incorporating 3D information, limiting their ability to capture full anatomical context. In this study, we propose Med-SORA, a framework for symptom-to-organ reasoning in abdominal CT images. Med-SORA introduces RAG-based dataset construction, soft labeling with learnable organ anchors to capture one-to-many symptom-organ relationships, and a 2D-3D cross-attention architecture to fuse local and global image features. To our knowledge, this is the first work to address symptom-to-organ reasoning in medical multimodal learning. Experimental results show that Med-SORA outperforms existing medical multimodal models and enables accurate 3D clinical reasoning.

Conclusion: 基于解耦HSV查找表的网络有效解决了紫色光晕问题，通过独立调整HSV分量克服了传统方法的颜色耦合问题，在缺乏配对数据的情况下实现了优异性能。

Abstract: Purple flare, a diffuse chromatic aberration artifact commonly found around highlight areas, severely degrades the tone transition and color of the image. Existing traditional methods are based on hand-crafted features, which lack flexibility and rely entirely on fixed priors, while the scarcity of paired training data critically hampers deep learning. To address this issue, we propose a novel network built upon decoupled HSV Look-Up Tables (LUTs). The method aims to simplify color correction by adjusting the Hue (H), Saturation (S), and Value (V) components independently. This approach resolves the inherent color coupling problems in traditional methods. Our model adopts a two-stage architecture: First, a Chroma-Aware Spectral Tokenizer (CAST) converts the input image from RGB space to HSV space and independently encodes the Hue (H) and Value (V) channels into a set of semantic tokens describing the Purple flare status; second, the HSV-LUT module takes these tokens as input and dynamically generates independent correction curves (1D-LUTs) for the three channels H, S, and V. To effectively train and validate our model, we built the first large-scale purple flare dataset with diverse scenes. We also proposed new metrics and a loss function specifically designed for this task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model not only significantly outperforms existing methods in visual effects but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on all quantitative metrics.

Motivation: 传统3DGS基于克隆的致密化方法会导致次优的空间分布，限制了场景探索并需要大量基元来覆盖场景。

Conclusion: ConeGS通过独立于现有几何状态的图像空间致密化，有效解决了3DGS的基元分布问题，实现了更高效的场景重建。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieves state-of-the-art image quality and real-time performance in novel view synthesis but often suffers from a suboptimal spatial distribution of primitives. This issue stems from cloning-based densification, which propagates Gaussians along existing geometry, limiting exploration and requiring many primitives to adequately cover the scene. We present ConeGS, an image-space-informed densification framework that is independent of existing scene geometry state. ConeGS first creates a fast Instant Neural Graphics Primitives (iNGP) reconstruction as a geometric proxy to estimate per-pixel depth. During the subsequent 3DGS optimization, it identifies high-error pixels and inserts new Gaussians along the corresponding viewing cones at the predicted depth values, initializing their size according to the cone diameter. A pre-activation opacity penalty rapidly removes redundant Gaussians, while a primitive budgeting strategy controls the total number of primitives, either by a fixed budget or by adapting to scene complexity, ensuring high reconstruction quality. Experiments show that ConeGS consistently enhances reconstruction quality and rendering performance across Gaussian budgets, with especially strong gains under tight primitive constraints where efficient placement is crucial.

Method: 提出时间可切换师生学习框架，包含统一模型（图像预测、前向视频预测、后向视频预测三种模式）和两阶段学习策略（图像到视频阶段和视频到视频阶段）。

Result: 在两个公共数据集上的实验结果显示，TiS-TSL在TEPE和EPE指标上分别比现有图像级方法至少提升2.11%和4.54%。

Conclusion: TiS-TSL通过引入时间建模和双向时空一致性，有效解决了最小监督下视频立体匹配的时间不稳定问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Stereo matching in minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is essential for next-generation navigation and augmented reality. Yet, dense disparity supervision is nearly impossible due to anatomical constraints, typically limiting annotations to only a few image-level labels acquired before the endoscope enters deep body cavities. Teacher-Student Learning (TSL) offers a promising solution by leveraging a teacher trained on sparse labels to generate pseudo labels and associated confidence maps from abundant unlabeled surgical videos. However, existing TSL methods are confined to image-level supervision, providing only spatial confidence and lacking temporal consistency estimation. This absence of spatio-temporal reliability results in unstable disparity predictions and severe flickering artifacts across video frames. To overcome these challenges, we propose TiS-TSL, a novel time-switchable teacher-student learning framework for video stereo matching under minimal supervision. At its core is a unified model that operates in three distinct modes: Image-Prediction (IP), Forward Video-Prediction (FVP), and Backward Video-Prediction (BVP), enabling flexible temporal modeling within a single architecture. Enabled by this unified model, TiS-TSL adopts a two-stage learning strategy. The Image-to-Video (I2V) stage transfers sparse image-level knowledge to initialize temporal modeling. The subsequent Video-to-Video (V2V) stage refines temporal disparity predictions by comparing forward and backward predictions to calculate bidirectional spatio-temporal consistency. This consistency identifies unreliable regions across frames, filters noisy video-level pseudo labels, and enforces temporal coherence. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate that TiS-TSL exceeds other image-based state-of-the-arts by improving TEPE and EPE by at least 2.11% and 4.54%, respectively..

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将生成扩散先验集成到即插即用框架中，为处理各种噪声类型（特别是非高斯噪声）的图像恢复提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Existing plug-and-play image restoration methods typically employ off-the-shelf Gaussian denoisers as proximal operators within classical optimization frameworks based on variable splitting. Recently, denoisers induced by generative priors have been successfully integrated into regularized optimization methods for image restoration under Gaussian noise. However, their application to non-Gaussian noise--such as impulse noise--remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play image restoration framework based on generative diffusion priors for robust removal of general noise types, including impulse noise. Within the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation framework, the data fidelity term is adapted to the specific noise model. Departing from the conventional least-squares loss used for Gaussian noise, we introduce a generalized Gaussian scale mixture-based loss, which approximates a wide range of noise distributions and leads to an $\ell_q$-norm ($0<q\leq2$) fidelity term. This optimization problem is addressed using an iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) approach, wherein the proximal step involving the generative prior is efficiently performed via a diffusion-based denoiser. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method effectively removes non-Gaussian impulse noise and achieves superior restoration performance.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) has recently emerged as a promising technique for 3D object reconstruction, delivering high-quality rendering results with significantly improved reconstruction speed. As variants continue to appear, assessing the perceptual quality of 3D objects reconstructed with different GS-based methods remains an open challenge. To address this issue, we first propose a unified multi-distance subjective quality assessment method that closely mimics human viewing behavior for objects reconstructed with GS-based methods in actual applications, thereby better collecting perceptual experiences. Based on it, we also construct a novel GS quality assessment dataset named MUGSQA, which is constructed considering multiple uncertainties of the input data. These uncertainties include the quantity and resolution of input views, the view distance, and the accuracy of the initial point cloud. Moreover, we construct two benchmarks: one to evaluate the robustness of various GS-based reconstruction methods under multiple uncertainties, and the other to evaluate the performance of existing quality assessment metrics. Our dataset and benchmark code will be released soon.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video diffusion models have significantly enhanced audio-driven portrait animation. However, current methods still suffer from flickering, identity drift, and poor audio-visual synchronization. These issues primarily stem from entangled appearance-motion representations and unstable inference strategies. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{ConsistTalk}, a novel intensity-controllable and temporally consistent talking head generation framework with diffusion noise search inference. First, we propose \textbf{an optical flow-guided temporal module (OFT)} that decouples motion features from static appearance by leveraging facial optical flow, thereby reducing visual flicker and improving temporal consistency. Second, we present an \textbf{Audio-to-Intensity (A2I) model} obtained through multimodal teacher-student knowledge distillation. By transforming audio and facial velocity features into a frame-wise intensity sequence, the A2I model enables joint modeling of audio and visual motion, resulting in more natural dynamics. This further enables fine-grained, frame-wise control of motion dynamics while maintaining tight audio-visual synchronization. Third, we introduce a \textbf{diffusion noise initialization strategy (IC-Init)}. By enforcing explicit constraints on background coherence and motion continuity during inference-time noise search, we achieve better identity preservation and refine motion dynamics compared to the current autoregressive strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConsistTalk significantly outperforms prior methods in reducing flicker, preserving identity, and delivering temporally stable, high-fidelity talking head videos.

Conclusion: NeuroBridge框架在视觉神经解码中表现出高效性、鲁棒性和可扩展性，为脑机接口和人工智能应用提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Visual neural decoding seeks to reconstruct or infer perceived visual stimuli from brain activity patterns, providing critical insights into human cognition and enabling transformative applications in brain-computer interfaces and artificial intelligence. Current approaches, however, remain constrained by the scarcity of high-quality stimulus-brain response pairs and the inherent semantic mismatch between neural representations and visual content. Inspired by perceptual variability and co-adaptive strategy of the biological systems, we propose a novel self-supervised architecture, named NeuroBridge, which integrates Cognitive Prior Augmentation (CPA) with Shared Semantic Projector (SSP) to promote effective cross-modality alignment. Specifically, CPA simulates perceptual variability by applying asymmetric, modality-specific transformations to both EEG signals and images, enhancing semantic diversity. Unlike previous approaches, SSP establishes a bidirectional alignment process through a co-adaptive strategy, which mutually aligns features from two modalities into a shared semantic space for effective cross-modal learning. NeuroBridge surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods under both intra-subject and inter-subject settings. In the intra-subject scenario, it achieves the improvements of 12.3% in top-1 accuracy and 10.2% in top-5 accuracy, reaching 63.2% and 89.9% respectively on a 200-way zero-shot retrieval task. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and scalability of the proposed framework for neural visual decoding.

Conclusion: PanoNav证明了仅使用RGB输入的无地图零样本物体导航的可行性，通过全景解析和记忆机制有效解决了局部死锁问题。

Abstract: Zero-shot object navigation (ZSON) in unseen environments remains a challenging problem for household robots, requiring strong perceptual understanding and decision-making capabilities. While recent methods leverage metric maps and Large Language Models (LLMs), they often depend on depth sensors or prebuilt maps, limiting the spatial reasoning ability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Mapless ZSON approaches have emerged to address this, but they typically make short-sighted decisions, leading to local deadlocks due to a lack of historical context. We propose PanoNav, a fully RGB-only, mapless ZSON framework that integrates a Panoramic Scene Parsing module to unlock the spatial parsing potential of MLLMs from panoramic RGB inputs, and a Memory-guided Decision-Making mechanism enhanced by a Dynamic Bounded Memory Queue to incorporate exploration history and avoid local deadlocks. Experiments on the public navigation benchmark show that PanoNav significantly outperforms representative baselines in both SR and SPL metrics.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are widely used for aerial photography and remote sensing applications. One of the main challenges is to stitch together multiple images into a single high-resolution image that covers a large area. Featurebased image stitching algorithms are commonly used but can suffer from errors and ambiguities in feature detection and matching. To address this, several approaches have been proposed, including using bundle adjustment techniques or direct image alignment. In this paper, we present a novel method that uses a combination of IMU data and computer vision techniques for stitching images captured by a UAV. Our method involves several steps such as estimating the displacement and rotation of the UAV between consecutive images, correcting for perspective distortion, and computing a homography matrix. We then use a standard image stitching algorithm to align and blend the images together. Our proposed method leverages the additional information provided by the IMU data, corrects for various sources of distortion, and can be easily integrated into existing UAV workflows. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method, outperforming some of the existing feature-based image stitching algorithms in terms of accuracy and reliability, particularly in challenging scenarios such as large displacements, rotations, and variations in camera pose.

Abstract: System identification involving the geometry, appearance, and physical properties from video observations is a challenging task with applications in robotics and graphics. Recent approaches have relied on fully differentiable Material Point Method (MPM) and rendering for simultaneous optimization of these properties. However, they are limited to simplified object-environment interactions with planar colliders and fail in more challenging scenarios where objects collide with non-planar surfaces. We propose AS-DiffMPM, a differentiable MPM framework that enables physical property estimation with arbitrarily shaped colliders. Our approach extends existing methods by incorporating a differentiable collision handling mechanism, allowing the target object to interact with complex rigid bodies while maintaining end-to-end optimization. We show AS-DiffMPM can be easily interfaced with various novel view synthesis methods as a framework for system identification from visual observations.

Conclusion: ViT的成功知识传递需要超越简单的特征模仿，尊重表征约束，为设计有效的ViT压缩策略提供了理论指导。

Abstract: While feature-based knowledge distillation has proven highly effective for compressing CNNs, these techniques unexpectedly fail when applied to Vision Transformers (ViTs), often performing worse than simple logit-based distillation. We provide the first comprehensive analysis of this phenomenon through a novel analytical framework termed as ``distillation dynamics", combining frequency spectrum analysis, information entropy metrics, and activation magnitude tracking. Our investigation reveals that ViTs exhibit a distinctive U-shaped information processing pattern: initial compression followed by expansion. We identify the root cause of negative transfer in feature distillation: a fundamental representational paradigm mismatch between teacher and student models. Through frequency-domain analysis, we show that teacher models employ distributed, high-dimensional encoding strategies in later layers that smaller student models cannot replicate due to limited channel capacity. This mismatch causes late-layer feature alignment to actively harm student performance. Our findings reveal that successful knowledge transfer in ViTs requires moving beyond naive feature mimicry to methods that respect these fundamental representational constraints, providing essential theoretical guidance for designing effective ViTs compression strategies.

Abstract: A simultaneous enhancement of accuracy and diversity of predictions remains a challenge in ambiguous medical image segmentation (AMIS) due to the inherent trade-offs. While truncated diffusion probabilistic models (TDPMs) hold strong potential with a paradigm optimization, existing TDPMs suffer from entangled accuracy and diversity of predictions with insufficient fidelity and plausibility. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose Ambiguity-aware Truncated Flow Matching (ATFM), which introduces a novel inference paradigm and dedicated model components. Firstly, we propose Data-Hierarchical Inference, a redefinition of AMIS-specific inference paradigm, which enhances accuracy and diversity at data-distribution and data-sample level, respectively, for an effective disentanglement. Secondly, Gaussian Truncation Representation (GTR) is introduced to enhance both fidelity of predictions and reliability of truncation distribution, by explicitly modeling it as a Gaussian distribution at $T_{\text{trunc}}$ instead of using sampling-based approximations.Thirdly, Segmentation Flow Matching (SFM) is proposed to enhance the plausibility of diverse predictions by extending semantic-aware flow transformation in Flow Matching (FM). Comprehensive evaluations on LIDC and ISIC3 datasets demonstrate that ATFM outperforms SOTA methods and simultaneously achieves a more efficient inference. ATFM improves GED and HM-IoU by up to $12\%$ and $7.3\%$ compared to advanced methods.

Method: 提出VAEVQ框架，包含三个关键组件：(1)变分潜在量化(VLQ)，用VAE替代AE进行量化，利用其结构化平滑潜在空间；(2)表示一致性策略(RCS)，自适应调节量化前后特征对齐强度；(3)分布一致性正则化(DCR)，对齐码本分布与连续潜在分布。

Conclusion: VAEVQ通过改进量化机制，有效解决了传统向量量化的核心问题，显著提升了码本利用率和生成模型性能。

Abstract: Vector quantization (VQ) transforms continuous image features into discrete representations, providing compressed, tokenized inputs for generative models. However, VQ-based frameworks suffer from several issues, such as non-smooth latent spaces, weak alignment between representations before and after quantization, and poor coherence between the continuous and discrete domains. These issues lead to unstable codeword learning and underutilized codebooks, ultimately degrading the performance of both reconstruction and downstream generation tasks. To this end, we propose VAEVQ, which comprises three key components: (1) Variational Latent Quantization (VLQ), replacing the AE with a VAE for quantization to leverage its structured and smooth latent space, thereby facilitating more effective codeword activation; (2) Representation Coherence Strategy (RCS), adaptively modulating the alignment strength between pre- and post-quantization features to enhance consistency and prevent overfitting to noise; and (3) Distribution Consistency Regularization (DCR), aligning the entire codebook distribution with the continuous latent distribution to improve utilization. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that VAEVQ outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 通过长结构化描述训练和DimFusion机制，显著提升了文本到图像模型的可控性和表达能力，为专业应用提供了更精确的控制能力。

Abstract: Text-to-image models have rapidly evolved from casual creative tools to professional-grade systems, achieving unprecedented levels of image quality and realism. Yet, most models are trained to map short prompts into detailed images, creating a gap between sparse textual input and rich visual outputs. This mismatch reduces controllability, as models often fill in missing details arbitrarily, biasing toward average user preferences and limiting precision for professional use. We address this limitation by training the first open-source text-to-image model on long structured captions, where every training sample is annotated with the same set of fine-grained attributes. This design maximizes expressive coverage and enables disentangled control over visual factors. To process long captions efficiently, we propose DimFusion, a fusion mechanism that integrates intermediate tokens from a lightweight LLM without increasing token length. We also introduce the Text-as-a-Bottleneck Reconstruction (TaBR) evaluation protocol. By assessing how well real images can be reconstructed through a captioning-generation loop, TaBR directly measures controllability and expressiveness, even for very long captions where existing evaluation methods fail. Finally, we demonstrate our contributions by training the large-scale model FIBO, achieving state-of-the-art prompt alignment among open-source models.

Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型在物体计数和空间排列方面缺乏精确控制，需要改进组合生成能力。

Method: 两阶段方法：1) LLM从物体列表生成结构化布局；2) 布局条件扩散模型根据布局合成图像。采用任务分解策略，先生成核心物体再用规则补充布局。比较ControlNet和GLIGEN两种条件方法。

Result: 任务分解显著提升物体召回率，从57.2%提高到99.9%。ControlNet保持文本风格控制但存在物体幻觉，GLIGEN布局保真度更高但提示控制性降低。

Conclusion: 解耦方法在组合控制合成方面具有可行性，能成功生成指定物体数量和合理空间排列的图像。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models exhibit remarkable generative capabilities, but lack precise control over object counts and spatial arrangements. This work introduces a two-stage system to address these compositional limitations. The first stage employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate a structured layout from a list of objects. The second stage uses a layout-conditioned diffusion model to synthesize a photorealistic image adhering to this layout. We find that task decomposition is critical for LLM-based spatial planning; by simplifying the initial generation to core objects and completing the layout with rule-based insertion, we improve object recall from 57.2% to 99.9% for complex scenes. For image synthesis, we compare two leading conditioning methods: ControlNet and GLIGEN. After domain-specific finetuning on table-setting datasets, we identify a key trade-off: ControlNet preserves text-based stylistic control but suffers from object hallucination, while GLIGEN provides superior layout fidelity at the cost of reduced prompt-based controllability. Our end-to-end system successfully generates images with specified object counts and plausible spatial arrangements, demonstrating the viability of a decoupled approach for compositionally controlled synthesis.

Conclusion: MPT通过保持血管结构语义完整性和自适应特征聚合，有效解决了复杂血管分割的挑战

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of aortic vascular structures is critical for diagnosing and treating cardiovascular diseases.Traditional Transformer-based models have shown promise in this domain by capturing long-range dependencies between vascular features. However, their reliance on fixed-size rectangular patches often influences the integrity of complex vascular structures, leading to suboptimal segmentation accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose the adaptive Morph Patch Transformer (MPT), a novel architecture specifically designed for aortic vascular segmentation. Specifically, MPT introduces an adaptive patch partitioning strategy that dynamically generates morphology-aware patches aligned with complex vascular structures. This strategy can preserve semantic integrity of complex vascular structures within individual patches. Moreover, a Semantic Clustering Attention (SCA) method is proposed to dynamically aggregate features from various patches with similar semantic characteristics. This method enhances the model's capability to segment vessels of varying sizes, preserving the integrity of vascular structures. Extensive experiments on three open-source dataset(AVT, AortaSeg24 and TBAD) demonstrate that MPT achieves state-of-the-art performance, with improvements in segmenting intricate vascular structures.

Conclusion: 反射式偏振光散射方法有效规避了水环境中的传输干扰，CNN主要依赖颗粒的微观结构和内部纹理进行决策，AOLP信号比DOLP信号对上下文噪声更具鲁棒性。

Abstract: Facing the critical need for continuous, large-scale microplastic monitoring, which is hindered by the limitations of gold-standard methods in aquatic environments, this paper introduces and validates a novel, reflection-based approach for the in-situ classification and identification of microplastics directly in water bodies, which is based on polarized light scattering. In this experiment, we classify colorless microplastic particles (50-300 $μ$m) by illuminating them with linearly polarized laser light and capturing their reflected signals using a polarization-sensitive camera. This reflection-based technique successfully circumvents the transmission-based interference issues that plague many conventional methods when applied in water. Using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for image-based classification, we successfully identified three common polymer types, high-density polyethylene, low-density polyethylene, and polypropylene, achieving a peak mean classification accuracy of 80% on the test dataset. A subsequent feature hierarchy analysis demonstrated that the CNN's decision-making process relies mainly on the microstructural integrity and internal texture (polarization patterns) of the particle rather than its macroshape. Critically, we found that the Angle of Linear Polarization (AOLP) signal is significantly more robust against contextual noise than the Degree of Linear Polarization (DOLP) signal. While the AOLP-based classification achieved superior overall performance, its strength lies in distinguishing between the two polyethylene plastics, showing a lower confusion rate between high-density and low-density polyethylene. Conversely, the DOLP signal demonstrated slightly worse overall classification results but excels at accurately identifying the polypropylene class, which it isolated with greater success than AOLP.

Conclusion: 该方法通过关键词屏蔽和维度解耦策略有效解决了单目3D视觉定位中的关键问题，显著提升了定位精度。

Abstract: Monocular 3D Visual Grounding (Mono3DVG) is an emerging task that locates 3D objects in RGB images using text descriptions with geometric cues. However, existing methods face two key limitations. Firstly, they often over-rely on high-certainty keywords that explicitly identify the target object while neglecting critical spatial descriptions. Secondly, generalized textual features contain both 2D and 3D descriptive information, thereby capturing an additional dimension of details compared to singular 2D or 3D visual features. This characteristic leads to cross-dimensional interference when refining visual features under text guidance. To overcome these challenges, we propose Mono3DVG-EnSD, a novel framework that integrates two key components: the CLIP-Guided Lexical Certainty Adapter (CLIP-LCA) and the Dimension-Decoupled Module (D2M). The CLIP-LCA dynamically masks high-certainty keywords while retaining low-certainty implicit spatial descriptions, thereby forcing the model to develop a deeper understanding of spatial relationships in captions for object localization. Meanwhile, the D2M decouples dimension-specific (2D/3D) textual features from generalized textual features to guide corresponding visual features at same dimension, which mitigates cross-dimensional interference by ensuring dimensionally-consistent cross-modal interactions. Through comprehensive comparisons and ablation studies on the Mono3DRefer dataset, our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across all metrics. Notably, it improves the challenging Far(Acc@0.5) scenario by a significant +13.54%.

Abstract: Video shadow detection confronts two entwined difficulties: distinguishing shadows from complex backgrounds and modeling dynamic shadow deformations under varying illumination. To address shadow-background ambiguity, we leverage linguistic priors through the proposed Vision-language Match Module (VMM) and a Dark-aware Semantic Block (DSB), extracting text-guided features to explicitly differentiate shadows from dark objects. Furthermore, we introduce adaptive mask reweighting to downweight penumbra regions during training and apply edge masks at the final decoder stage for better supervision. For temporal modeling of variable shadow shapes, we propose a Tokenized Temporal Block (TTB) that decouples spatiotemporal learning. TTB summarizes cross-frame shadow semantics into learnable temporal tokens, enabling efficient sequence encoding with minimal computation overhead. Comprehensive Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy and real-time inference efficiency. Codes are available at https://github.com/city-cheng/DTTNet.

Abstract: Global plant maps of plant traits, such as leaf nitrogen or plant height, are essential for understanding ecosystem processes, including the carbon and energy cycles of the Earth system. However, existing trait maps remain limited by the high cost and sparse geographic coverage of field-based measurements. Citizen science initiatives offer a largely untapped resource to overcome these limitations, with over 50 million geotagged plant photographs worldwide capturing valuable visual information on plant morphology and physiology. In this study, we introduce PlantTraitNet, a multi-modal, multi-task uncertainty-aware deep learning framework that predictsfour key plant traits (plant height, leaf area, specific leaf area, and nitrogen content) from citizen science photos using weak supervision. By aggregating individual trait predictions across space, we generate global maps of trait distributions. We validate these maps against independent vegetation survey data (sPlotOpen) and benchmark them against leading global trait products. Our results show that PlantTraitNet consistently outperforms existing trait maps across all evaluated traits, demonstrating that citizen science imagery, when integrated with computer vision and geospatial AI, enables not only scalable but also more accurate global trait mapping. This approach offers a powerful new pathway for ecological research and Earth system modeling.

Abstract: Explanation-guided learning (EGL) has shown promise in aligning model predictions with interpretable reasoning, particularly in computer vision tasks. However, most approaches rely on external annotations or heuristic-based segmentation to supervise model explanations, which can be noisy, imprecise and difficult to scale. In this work, we provide both empirical and theoretical evidence that low-quality supervision signals can degrade model performance rather than improve it. In response, we propose ALIGN, a novel framework that jointly trains a classifier and a masker in an iterative manner. The masker learns to produce soft, task-relevant masks that highlight informative regions, while the classifier is optimized for both prediction accuracy and alignment between its saliency maps and the learned masks. By leveraging high-quality masks as guidance, ALIGN improves both interpretability and generalizability, showing its superiority across various settings. Experiments on the two domain generalization benchmarks, VLCS and Terra Incognita, show that ALIGN consistently outperforms six strong baselines in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings. Besides, ALIGN also yields superior explanation quality concerning sufficiency and comprehensiveness, highlighting its effectiveness in producing accurate and interpretable models.

Motivation: CLIPscore等基于CLIP的评估指标虽然应用广泛，但其多模态对齐特性容易受到攻击，需要研究如何欺骗这类指标并建立相应的防御机制。

Method: 基于随机梯度下降技术，整合三个关键组件：特征对齐模块（减少图像-文本模态差距）、分数分布平衡模块和像素保护正则化，共同优化CLIPscore性能和图像质量之间的多模态输出平衡。

Result: 在十个艺术杰作提示和ImageNet子集上的实验表明，优化后的图像在保持高视觉保真度的同时显著提高了CLIPscore。灰度转换会显著降低欺骗图像的特征质量，基于此提出的颜色通道敏感性篡改检测机制在标准基准上达到91%的准确率。

Conclusion: 本研究为CLIP-based多模态系统中的特征错位攻击建立了实用路径，并提出了相应的防御方法。

Abstract: The well-aligned attribute of CLIP-based models enables its effective application like CLIPscore as a widely adopted image quality assessment metric. However, such a CLIP-based metric is vulnerable for its delicate multimodal alignment. In this work, we propose \textbf{FoCLIP}, a feature-space misalignment framework for fooling CLIP-based image quality metric. Based on the stochastic gradient descent technique, FoCLIP integrates three key components to construct fooling examples: feature alignment as the core module to reduce image-text modality gaps, the score distribution balance module and pixel-guard regularization, which collectively optimize multimodal output equilibrium between CLIPscore performance and image quality. Such a design can be engineered to maximize the CLIPscore predictions across diverse input prompts, despite exhibiting either visual unrecognizability or semantic incongruence with the corresponding adversarial prompts from human perceptual perspectives. Experiments on ten artistic masterpiece prompts and ImageNet subsets demonstrate that optimized images can achieve significant improvement in CLIPscore while preserving high visual fidelity. In addition, we found that grayscale conversion induces significant feature degradation in fooling images, exhibiting noticeable CLIPscore reduction while preserving statistical consistency with original images. Inspired by this phenomenon, we propose a color channel sensitivity-driven tampering detection mechanism that achieves 91% accuracy on standard benchmarks. In conclusion, this work establishes a practical pathway for feature misalignment in CLIP-based multimodal systems and the corresponding defense method.

Conclusion: PADM为心脏SPECT成像提供了一种有效的CT-free衰减校正解决方案，有望提高诊断准确性并促进临床广泛应用。

Abstract: Attenuation artifacts remain a significant challenge in cardiac Myocardial Perfusion Imaging (MPI) using Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT), often compromising diagnostic accuracy and reducing clinical interpretability. While hybrid SPECT/CT systems mitigate these artifacts through CT-derived attenuation maps, their high cost, limited accessibility, and added radiation exposure hinder widespread clinical adoption. In this study, we propose a novel CT-free solution to attenuation correction in cardiac SPECT. Specifically, we introduce Physics-aware Attenuation Correction Diffusion Model (PADM), a diffusion-based generative method that incorporates explicit physics priors via a teacher--student distillation mechanism. This approach enables attenuation artifact correction using only Non-Attenuation-Corrected (NAC) input, while still benefiting from physics-informed supervision during training. To support this work, we also introduce CardiAC, a comprehensive dataset comprising 424 patient studies with paired NAC and Attenuation-Corrected (AC) reconstructions, alongside high-resolution CT-based attenuation maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PADM outperforms state-of-the-art generative models, delivering superior reconstruction fidelity across both quantitative metrics and visual assessment.

Conclusion: GFix通过结合扩散模型和调制LoRA技术，有效提升了3DGS视频压缩的感知质量和压缩效率，为低层视觉任务提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enhances 3D scene reconstruction through explicit representation and fast rendering, demonstrating potential benefits for various low-level vision tasks, including video compression. However, existing 3DGS-based video codecs generally exhibit more noticeable visual artifacts and relatively low compression ratios. In this paper, we specifically target the perceptual enhancement of 3DGS-based video compression, based on the assumption that artifacts from 3DGS rendering and quantization resemble noisy latents sampled during diffusion training. Building on this premise, we propose a content-adaptive framework, GFix, comprising a streamlined, single-step diffusion model that serves as an off-the-shelf neural enhancer. Moreover, to increase compression efficiency, We propose a modulated LoRA scheme that freezes the low-rank decompositions and modulates the intermediate hidden states, thereby achieving efficient adaptation of the diffusion backbone with highly compressible updates. Experimental results show that GFix delivers strong perceptual quality enhancement, outperforming GSVC with up to 72.1% BD-rate savings in LPIPS and 21.4% in FID.

Conclusion: WISE-MAE通过引入结构化和生物学相关性的补丁选择策略，有效提升了数字病理学中MAE表示学习的质量。

Abstract: Whole-slide images are central to digital pathology, yet their extreme size and scarce annotations make self-supervised learning essential. Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) with Vision Transformer backbones have recently shown strong potential for histopathology representation learning. However, conventional random patch sampling during MAE pretraining often includes irrelevant or noisy regions, limiting the model's ability to capture meaningful tissue patterns. In this paper, we present a lightweight and domain-adapted framework that brings structure and biological relevance into MAE-based learning through a wavelet-informed patch selection strategy. WISE-MAE applies a two-step coarse-to-fine process: wavelet-based screening at low magnification to locate structurally rich regions, followed by high-resolution extraction for detailed modeling. This approach mirrors the diagnostic workflow of pathologists and improves the quality of learned representations. Evaluations across multiple cancer datasets, including lung, renal, and colorectal tissues, show that WISE-MAE achieves competitive representation quality and downstream classification performance while maintaining efficiency under weak supervision.

Abstract: 3D semantic scene understanding remains a long-standing challenge in the 3D computer vision community. One of the key issues pertains to limited real-world annotated data to facilitate generalizable models. The common practice to tackle this issue is to simulate new data. Although synthetic datasets offer scalability and perfect labels, their designer-crafted scenes fail to capture real-world complexity and sensor noise, resulting in a synthetic-to-real domain gap. Moreover, no benchmark provides synchronized real and simulated point clouds for segmentation-oriented domain shift analysis. We introduce TrueCity, the first urban semantic segmentation benchmark with cm-accurate annotated real-world point clouds, semantic 3D city models, and annotated simulated point clouds representing the same city. TrueCity proposes segmentation classes aligned with international 3D city modeling standards, enabling consistent evaluation of synthetic-to-real gap. Our extensive experiments on common baselines quantify domain shift and highlight strategies for exploiting synthetic data to enhance real-world 3D scene understanding. We are convinced that the TrueCity dataset will foster further development of sim-to-real gap quantification and enable generalizable data-driven models. The data, code, and 3D models are available online: https://tum-gis.github.io/TrueCity/

Conclusion: 有效的深度伪造检测未来依赖于快速数据收集和先进帧级特征检测器的开发，需要持续维护大型多样化数据集。

Abstract: The continually advancing quality of deepfake technology exacerbates the threats of disinformation, fraud, and harassment by making maliciously-generated synthetic content increasingly difficult to distinguish from reality. We introduce a simple yet effective two-stage detection method that achieves an AUROC of over 99.8% on contemporary deepfakes. However, this high performance is short-lived. We show that models trained on this data suffer a recall drop of over 30% when evaluated on deepfakes created with generation techniques from just six months later, demonstrating significant decay as threats evolve. Our analysis reveals two key insights for robust detection. Firstly, continued performance requires the ongoing curation of large, diverse datasets. Second, predictive power comes primarily from static, frame-level artifacts, not temporal inconsistencies. The future of effective deepfake detection therefore depends on rapid data collection and the development of advanced frame-level feature detectors.

Result: 在ModelNet40和ScanObjectNN数据集上的实验表明，FreqCert在强扰动下始终获得更高的认证准确率和经验准确率。

Conclusion: 谱表示为实现3D点云识别中可认证鲁棒性提供了有效途径。

Abstract: 3D point cloud classification is a fundamental task in safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. However, recent studies reveal that point cloud classifiers are vulnerable to structured adversarial perturbations and geometric corruptions, posing risks to their deployment in safety-critical scenarios. Existing certified defenses limit point-wise perturbations but overlook subtle geometric distortions that preserve individual points yet alter the overall structure, potentially leading to misclassification. In this work, we propose FreqCert, a novel certification framework that departs from conventional spatial domain defenses by shifting robustness analysis to the frequency domain, enabling structured certification against global L2-bounded perturbations. FreqCert first transforms the input point cloud via the graph Fourier transform (GFT), then applies structured frequency-aware subsampling to generate multiple sub-point clouds. Each sub-cloud is independently classified by a standard model, and the final prediction is obtained through majority voting, where sub-clouds are constructed based on spectral similarity rather than spatial proximity, making the partitioning more stable under L2 perturbations and better aligned with the object's intrinsic structure. We derive a closed-form lower bound on the certified L2 robustness radius and prove its tightness under minimal and interpretable assumptions, establishing a theoretical foundation for frequency domain certification. Extensive experiments on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN datasets demonstrate that FreqCert consistently achieves higher certified accuracy and empirical accuracy under strong perturbations. Our results suggest that spectral representations provide an effective pathway toward certifiable robustness in 3D point cloud recognition.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have recently achieved notable progress in 3D point cloud recognition, yet their vulnerability to adversarial perturbations poses critical security challenges in practical deployments. Conventional defense mechanisms struggle to address the evolving landscape of multifaceted attack patterns. Through systematic analysis of existing defenses, we identify that their unsatisfactory performance primarily originates from an entangled feature space, where adversarial attacks can be performed easily. To this end, we present 3D-ANC, a novel approach that capitalizes on the Neural Collapse (NC) mechanism to orchestrate discriminative feature learning. In particular, NC depicts where last-layer features and classifier weights jointly evolve into a simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF) arrangement, establishing maximally separable class prototypes. However, leveraging this advantage in 3D recognition confronts two substantial challenges: (1) prevalent class imbalance in point cloud datasets, and (2) complex geometric similarities between object categories. To tackle these obstacles, our solution combines an ETF-aligned classification module with an adaptive training framework consisting of representation-balanced learning (RBL) and dynamic feature direction loss (FDL). 3D-ANC seamlessly empowers existing models to develop disentangled feature spaces despite the complexity in 3D data distribution. Comprehensive evaluations state that 3D-ANC significantly improves the robustness of models with various structures on two datasets. For instance, DGCNN's classification accuracy is elevated from 27.2% to 80.9% on ModelNet40 -- a 53.7% absolute gain that surpasses leading baselines by 34.0%.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对视频基础模型的新型对抗攻击方法TVA，能够在无需访问下游任务、训练数据、模型查询和架构的情况下，直接利用视频基础模型的时序表示动态来生成有效的对抗扰动。

Motivation: 大规模视频基础模型的开放可访问性带来了严重的安全风险，攻击者可以利用对VFMs的完整知识发起有效攻击。本文研究了一种新颖实用的对抗威胁场景：攻击从开源VFMs微调的下游模型或多模态大语言模型。

Method: 提出了TVA（可转移视频攻击）方法，这是一种时序感知的对抗攻击方法，利用视频基础模型的时序表示动态来生成有效扰动。TVA集成了双向对比学习机制来最大化干净特征和对抗特征之间的差异，并引入了时序一致性损失来利用运动线索增强扰动的序列影响。

Conclusion: TVA避免了训练昂贵的代理模型或访问领域特定数据的需要，从而提供了一种更实用和高效的攻击策略。这项工作揭示了视频基础模型在部署过程中的安全脆弱性。

Abstract: Large-scale Video Foundation Models (VFMs) has significantly advanced various video-related tasks, either through task-specific models or Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, the open accessibility of VFMs also introduces critical security risks, as adversaries can exploit full knowledge of the VFMs to launch potent attacks. This paper investigates a novel and practical adversarial threat scenario: attacking downstream models or MLLMs fine-tuned from open-source VFMs, without requiring access to the victim task, training data, model query, and architecture. In contrast to conventional transfer-based attacks that rely on task-aligned surrogate models, we demonstrate that adversarial vulnerabilities can be exploited directly from the VFMs. To this end, we propose the Transferable Video Attack (TVA), a temporal-aware adversarial attack method that leverages the temporal representation dynamics of VFMs to craft effective perturbations. TVA integrates a bidirectional contrastive learning mechanism to maximize the discrepancy between the clean and adversarial features, and introduces a temporal consistency loss that exploits motion cues to enhance the sequential impact of perturbations. TVA avoids the need to train expensive surrogate models or access to domain-specific data, thereby offering a more practical and efficient attack strategy. Extensive experiments across 24 video-related tasks demonstrate the efficacy of TVA against downstream models and MLLMs, revealing a previously underexplored security vulnerability in the deployment of video models.

Abstract: The generalization capability of deepfake detectors is critical for real-world use. Data augmentation via synthetic fake face generation effectively enhances generalization, yet current SoTA methods rely on fixed strategies-raising a key question: Is a single static augmentation sufficient, or does the diversity of forgery features demand dynamic approaches? We argue existing methods overlook the evolving complexity of real-world forgeries (e.g., facial warping, expression manipulation), which fixed policies cannot fully simulate. To address this, we propose CRDA (Curriculum Reinforcement-Learning Data Augmentation), a novel framework guiding detectors to progressively master multi-domain forgery features from simple to complex. CRDA synthesizes augmented samples via a configurable pool of forgery operations and dynamically generates adversarial samples tailored to the detector's current learning state. Central to our approach is integrating reinforcement learning (RL) and causal inference. An RL agent dynamically selects augmentation actions based on detector performance to efficiently explore the vast augmentation space, adapting to increasingly challenging forgeries. Simultaneously, the agent introduces action space variations to generate heterogeneous forgery patterns, guided by causal inference to mitigate spurious correlations-suppressing task-irrelevant biases and focusing on causally invariant features. This integration ensures robust generalization by decoupling synthetic augmentation patterns from the model's learned representations. Extensive experiments show our method significantly improves detector generalizability, outperforming SOTA methods across multiple cross-domain datasets.

Abstract: Millimeter-wave radar offers a promising sensing modality for autonomous systems thanks to its robustness in adverse conditions and low cost. However, its utility is significantly limited by the sparsity and low resolution of radar point clouds, which poses challenges for tasks requiring dense and accurate 3D perception. Despite that recent efforts have shown great potential by exploring generative approaches to address this issue, they often rely on dense voxel representations that are inefficient and struggle to preserve structural detail. To fill this gap, we make the key observation that latent diffusion models (LDMs), though successful in other modalities, have not been effectively leveraged for radar-based 3D generation due to a lack of compatible representations and conditioning strategies. We introduce RaLD, a framework that bridges this gap by integrating scene-level frustum-based LiDAR autoencoding, order-invariant latent representations, and direct radar spectrum conditioning. These insights lead to a more compact and expressive generation process. Experiments show that RaLD produces dense and accurate 3D point clouds from raw radar spectrums, offering a promising solution for robust perception in challenging environments.

Abstract: Large-scale visual out-of-distribution (OOD) detection has witnessed remarkable progress by leveraging vision-language models such as CLIP. However, a significant limitation of current methods is their reliance on a pre-defined set of in-distribution (ID) ground-truth label names (positives). These fixed label names can be unavailable, unreliable at scale, or become less relevant due to in-distribution shifts after deployment. Towards truly unsupervised OOD detection, we utilize widely available text corpora for positive label mining, bypassing the need for positives. In this paper, we utilize widely available text corpora for positive label mining under a general concept mining paradigm. Within this framework, we propose ClusterMine, a novel positive label mining method. ClusterMine is the first method to achieve state-of-the-art OOD detection performance without access to positive labels. It extracts positive concepts from a large text corpus by combining visual-only sample consistency (via clustering) and zero-shot image-text consistency. Our experimental study reveals that ClusterMine is scalable across a plethora of CLIP models and achieves state-of-the-art robustness to covariate in-distribution shifts.

Conclusion: LeCoT通过创新的网络架构设计，无需额外模块就能有效利用全局上下文信息，在多个计算机视觉任务中表现出色，解决了传统方法中信息丢失的问题。

Abstract: Two-view correspondence pruning aims to accurately remove incorrect correspondences (outliers) from initial ones and is widely applied to various computer vision tasks. Current popular strategies adopt multilayer perceptron (MLP) as the backbone, supplemented by additional modules to enhance the network ability to handle context information, which is a known limitation of MLPs. In contrast, we introduce a novel perspective for capturing correspondence context information without extra design modules. To this end, we design a two-view correspondence pruning network called LeCoT, which can naturally leverage global context information at different stages. Specifically, the core design of LeCoT is the Spatial-Channel Fusion Transformer block, a newly proposed component that efficiently utilizes both spatial and channel global context information among sparse correspondences. In addition, we integrate the proposed prediction block that utilizes correspondence features from intermediate stages to generate a probability set, which acts as guiding information for subsequent learning phases, allowing the network to more effectively capture robust global context information. Notably, this prediction block progressively refines the probability set, thereby mitigating the issue of information loss that is common in the traditional one. Extensive experiments prove that the proposed LeCoT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in correspondence pruning, relative pose estimation, homography estimation, visual localization, and $3$D~reconstruction tasks.

  To complement the dataset, we also introduce SimpleLidarLane, a light-weight baseline method for lane line reconstruction that combines BEV segmentation, clustering, and polyline fitting. Despite its simplicity, our method achieves strong performance under challenging various conditions (e.g., rain, sparse returns), showing that modular pipelines paired with high-quality data and principled evaluation can compete with more complex approaches.

Abstract: Text-to-image generative models often exhibit bias related to sensitive attributes. However, current research tends to focus narrowly on single-object prompts with limited contextual diversity. In reality, each object or attribute within a prompt can contribute to bias. For example, the prompt "an assistant wearing a pink hat" may reflect female-inclined biases associated with a pink hat. The neglected joint effects of the semantic binding in the prompts cause significant failures in current debiasing approaches. This work initiates a preliminary investigation on how bias manifests under semantic binding, where contextual associations between objects and attributes influence generative outcomes. We demonstrate that the underlying bias distribution can be amplified based on these associations. Therefore, we introduce a bias adherence score that quantifies how specific object-attribute bindings activate bias. To delve deeper, we develop a training-free context-bias control framework to explore how token decoupling can facilitate the debiasing of semantic bindings. This framework achieves over 10% debiasing improvement in compositional generation tasks. Our analysis of bias scores across various attribute-object bindings and token decorrelation highlights a fundamental challenge: reducing bias without disrupting essential semantic relationships. These findings expose critical limitations in current debiasing approaches when applied to semantically bound contexts, underscoring the need to reassess prevailing bias mitigation strategies.

Abstract: Improving the quality of hyperspectral images (HSIs), such as through super-resolution, is a crucial research area. However, generative modeling for HSIs presents several challenges. Due to their high spectral dimensionality, HSIs are too memory-intensive for direct input into conventional diffusion models. Furthermore, general generative models lack an understanding of the topological and geometric structures of ground objects in remote sensing imagery. In addition, most diffusion models optimize loss functions at the noise level, leading to a non-intuitive convergence behavior and suboptimal generation quality for complex data. To address these challenges, we propose a Geometric Enhanced Wavelet-based Diffusion Model (GEWDiff), a novel framework for reconstructing hyperspectral images at 4-times super-resolution. A wavelet-based encoder-decoder is introduced that efficiently compresses HSIs into a latent space while preserving spectral-spatial information. To avoid distortion during generation, we incorporate a geometry-enhanced diffusion process that preserves the geometric features. Furthermore, a multi-level loss function was designed to guide the diffusion process, promoting stable convergence and improved reconstruction fidelity. Our model demonstrated state-of-the-art results across multiple dimensions, including fidelity, spectral accuracy, visual realism, and clarity.

Result: 在nuScenes基准测试中实现最先进的端到端多任务3D感知结果，并在nuScenes端到端自动驾驶基准中获得最低碰撞率。

Conclusion: HENet++框架有效解决了多任务3D感知的计算兼容性和特征表示问题，为自动驾驶系统提供了更全面的信息支持。

Abstract: Three-dimensional feature extraction is a critical component of autonomous driving systems, where perception tasks such as 3D object detection, bird's-eye-view (BEV) semantic segmentation, and occupancy prediction serve as important constraints on 3D features. While large image encoders, high-resolution images, and long-term temporal inputs can significantly enhance feature quality and deliver remarkable performance gains, these techniques are often incompatible in both training and inference due to computational resource constraints. Moreover, different tasks favor distinct feature representations, making it difficult for a single model to perform end-to-end inference across multiple tasks while maintaining accuracy comparable to that of single-task models. To alleviate these issues, we present the HENet and HENet++ framework for multi-task 3D perception and end-to-end autonomous driving. Specifically, we propose a hybrid image encoding network that uses a large image encoder for short-term frames and a small one for long-term frames. Furthermore, our framework simultaneously extracts both dense and sparse features, providing more suitable representations for different tasks, reducing cumulative errors, and delivering more comprehensive information to the planning module. The proposed architecture maintains compatibility with various existing 3D feature extraction methods and supports multimodal inputs. HENet++ achieves state-of-the-art end-to-end multi-task 3D perception results on the nuScenes benchmark, while also attaining the lowest collision rate on the nuScenes end-to-end autonomous driving benchmark.

Conclusion: Sparse4DGS成功解决了稀疏帧动态场景重建的挑战，特别是在纹理丰富区域，为设备受限场景提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Dynamic Gaussian Splatting approaches have achieved remarkable performance for 4D scene reconstruction. However, these approaches rely on dense-frame video sequences for photorealistic reconstruction. In real-world scenarios, due to equipment constraints, sometimes only sparse frames are accessible. In this paper, we propose Sparse4DGS, the first method for sparse-frame dynamic scene reconstruction. We observe that dynamic reconstruction methods fail in both canonical and deformed spaces under sparse-frame settings, especially in areas with high texture richness. Sparse4DGS tackles this challenge by focusing on texture-rich areas. For the deformation network, we propose Texture-Aware Deformation Regularization, which introduces a texture-based depth alignment loss to regulate Gaussian deformation. For the canonical Gaussian field, we introduce Texture-Aware Canonical Optimization, which incorporates texture-based noise into the gradient descent process of canonical Gaussians. Extensive experiments show that when taking sparse frames as inputs, our method outperforms existing dynamic or few-shot techniques on NeRF-Synthetic, HyperNeRF, NeRF-DS, and our iPhone-4D datasets.

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过直接建模音乐与视觉艺术之间的感知一致性，有效解决了音乐诱导绘画评估的挑战，超越了基于情感相似性的传统方法。

Abstract: Music induced painting is a unique artistic practice, where visual artworks are created under the influence of music. Evaluating whether a painting faithfully reflects the music that inspired it poses a challenging perceptual assessment task. Existing methods primarily rely on emotion recognition models to assess the similarity between music and painting, but such models introduce considerable noise and overlook broader perceptual cues beyond emotion. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework for music induced painting assessment that directly models perceptual coherence between music and visual art. We introduce MPD, the first large scale dataset of music painting pairs annotated by domain experts based on perceptual coherence. To better handle ambiguous cases, we further collect pairwise preference annotations. Building on this dataset, we present MPJudge, a model that integrates music features into a visual encoder via a modulation based fusion mechanism. To effectively learn from ambiguous cases, we adopt Direct Preference Optimization for training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches. Qualitative results further show that our model more accurately identifies music relevant regions in paintings.

Conclusion: ProcGen3D提供了一种有效的3D内容创建方法，通过程序化图生成实现了高质量的3D重建，即使仅在合成数据上训练也能泛化到真实图像。

Abstract: We introduce ProcGen3D, a new approach for 3D content creation by generating procedural graph abstractions of 3D objects, which can then be decoded into rich, complex 3D assets. Inspired by the prevalent use of procedural generators in production 3D applications, we propose a sequentialized, graph-based procedural graph representation for 3D assets. We use this to learn to approximate the landscape of a procedural generator for image-based 3D reconstruction. We employ edge-based tokenization to encode the procedural graphs, and train a transformer prior to predict the next token conditioned on an input RGB image. Crucially, to enable better alignment of our generated outputs to an input image, we incorporate Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) guided sampling into our generation process, steering output procedural graphs towards more image-faithful reconstructions. Our approach is applicable across a variety of objects that can be synthesized with procedural generators. Extensive experiments on cacti, trees, and bridges show that our neural procedural graph generation outperforms both state-of-the-art generative 3D methods and domain-specific modeling techniques. Furthermore, this enables improved generalization on real-world input images, despite training only on synthetic data.

Motivation: 深度学习视频监控需要隐私保护架构，但部署大型视觉语言模型会带来能源和可持续性挑战。

Method: 在RWF-2000和RLVS数据集上比较三种联邦学习策略：零-shot推理、LoRA微调和个性化联邦学习3D CNN。

Result: 所有方法在二元暴力检测中准确率均超过90%。3D CNN能耗仅为LoRA的一半(240 Wh vs 570 Wh)，ROC AUC达92.59%。层次类别分组将VLM多类准确率从65.31%提升至81%。

Conclusion: 建议采用混合部署策略：默认使用高效CNN进行常规推理，选择性使用VLM进行复杂上下文推理。

Abstract: Deep learning-based video surveillance increasingly demands privacy-preserving architectures with low computational and environmental overhead. Federated learning preserves privacy but deploying large vision-language models (VLMs) introduces major energy and sustainability challenges. We compare three strategies for federated violence detection under realistic non-IID splits on the RWF-2000 and RLVS datasets: zero-shot inference with pretrained VLMs, LoRA-based fine-tuning of LLaVA-NeXT-Video-7B, and personalized federated learning of a 65.8M-parameter 3D CNN. All methods exceed 90% accuracy in binary violence detection. The 3D CNN achieves superior calibration (ROC AUC 92.59%) at roughly half the energy cost (240 Wh vs. 570 Wh) of federated LoRA, while VLMs provide richer multimodal reasoning. Hierarchical category grouping (based on semantic similarity and class exclusion) boosts VLM multiclass accuracy from 65.31% to 81% on the UCF-Crime dataset. To our knowledge, this is the first comparative simulation study of LoRA-tuned VLMs and personalized CNNs for federated violence detection, with explicit energy and CO2e quantification. Our results inform hybrid deployment strategies that default to efficient CNNs for routine inference and selectively engage VLMs for complex contextual reasoning.

Conclusion: LiteUpdate框架能有效提升检测器更新效率，平衡对新生成器的适应性和对先前知识的保留，解决灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative AI has led to the emergence of new generative models, while existing detection methods struggle to keep pace, resulting in significant degradation in the detection performance. This highlights the urgent need for continuously updating AI-generated image detectors to adapt to new generators. To overcome low efficiency and catastrophic forgetting in detector updates, we propose LiteUpdate, a lightweight framework for updating AI-generated image detectors. LiteUpdate employs a representative sample selection module that leverages image confidence and gradient-based discriminative features to precisely select boundary samples. This approach improves learning and detection accuracy on new distributions with limited generated images, significantly enhancing detector update efficiency. Additionally, LiteUpdate incorporates a model merging module that fuses weights from multiple fine-tuning trajectories, including pre-trained, representative, and random updates. This balances the adaptability to new generators and mitigates the catastrophic forgetting of prior knowledge. Experiments demonstrate that LiteUpdate substantially boosts detection performance in various detectors. Specifically, on AIDE, the average detection accuracy on Midjourney improved from 87.63% to 93.03%, a 6.16% relative increase.

Motivation: 内窥镜鼻窦手术需要术前评估颅底解剖结构以降低脑脊液漏等风险，现有解剖风险评分需要基于冠状CT或CBCT扫描进行耗时的手动测量。

Method: 开发了自动化深度学习管道，通过热图回归定位关键解剖标志点来估计风险评分，比较了直接方法和专门的全局到局部学习策略。

Conclusion: 该自动化方法能够准确估计内窥镜鼻窦手术中的解剖风险评分，为术前规划提供了高效工具。

Abstract: Endoscopic sinus surgery requires careful preoperative assessment of the skull base anatomy to minimize risks such as cerebrospinal fluid leakage. Anatomical risk scores like the Keros, Gera and Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore score offer a standardized approach but require time-consuming manual measurements on coronal CT or CBCT scans. We propose an automated deep learning pipeline that estimates these risk scores by localizing key anatomical landmarks via heatmap regression. We compare a direct approach to a specialized global-to-local learning strategy and find mean absolute errors on the relevant anatomical measurements of 0.506mm for the Keros, 4.516° for the Gera and 0.802mm / 0.777mm for the TMS classification.

Motivation: 隐式神经表示为信号表示提供了有前景的框架，但需要确保INR满足SDF应有的全局属性（如单位梯度），因此需要引入几何正则化。

Method: 使用几何INRs，在损失函数中加入微分几何工具（如法向量和曲率）作为正则化项，从有向点云或姿态图像进行3D表面重建。

Result: 几何INRs在有向点云和姿态图像的表面重建方面取得了显著进展。

Conclusion: 几何INRs通过引入微分几何视角的几何损失函数和采样方案，显著提升了表面重建的质量和准确性。

Abstract: \textit{Implicit neural representations} (INRs) have emerged as a promising framework for representing signals in low-dimensional spaces. This survey reviews the existing literature on the specialized INR problem of approximating \textit{signed distance functions} (SDFs) for surface scenes, using either oriented point clouds or a set of posed images. We refer to neural SDFs that incorporate differential geometry tools, such as normals and curvatures, in their loss functions as \textit{geometric} INRs. The key idea behind this 3D reconstruction approach is to include additional \textit{regularization} terms in the loss function, ensuring that the INR satisfies certain global properties that the function should hold -- such as having unit gradient in the case of SDFs. We explore key methodological components, including the definition of INR, the construction of geometric loss functions, and sampling schemes from a differential geometry perspective. Our review highlights the significant advancements enabled by geometric INRs in surface reconstruction from oriented point clouds and posed images.

Motivation: 现有干净图像后门攻击需要较高投毒率，导致清洁准确率明显下降，影响隐蔽性。需要开发更隐蔽的攻击方法。

Method: 使用条件InfoGAN框架识别自然图像特征作为触发器，确保触发器与良性特征易于分离，从而在极少量投毒样本上学习后门。

Result: GCB在6个数据集、5种架构和4种任务上表现优异，首次在回归和分割任务中实现干净图像后门攻击，对现有防御方法具有抵抗力。

Conclusion: GCB提供了一种高效隐蔽的后门攻击范式，显著降低了攻击对模型清洁性能的影响，展示了在多种任务和场景下的适用性。

Abstract: Clean-image backdoor attacks, which use only label manipulation in training datasets to compromise deep neural networks, pose a significant threat to security-critical applications. A critical flaw in existing methods is that the poison rate required for a successful attack induces a proportional, and thus noticeable, drop in Clean Accuracy (CA), undermining their stealthiness. This paper presents a new paradigm for clean-image attacks that minimizes this accuracy degradation by optimizing the trigger itself. We introduce Generative Clean-Image Backdoors (GCB), a framework that uses a conditional InfoGAN to identify naturally occurring image features that can serve as potent and stealthy triggers. By ensuring these triggers are easily separable from benign task-related features, GCB enables a victim model to learn the backdoor from an extremely small set of poisoned examples, resulting in a CA drop of less than 1%. Our experiments demonstrate GCB's remarkable versatility, successfully adapting to six datasets, five architectures, and four tasks, including the first demonstration of clean-image backdoors in regression and segmentation. GCB also exhibits resilience against most of the existing backdoor defenses.

Motivation: 难民营地中的水、环境卫生和个人卫生服务可及性是一个重要的公共卫生问题，特别是在人口密集的难民营中。传统方法难以准确评估这些服务的可及性。

Method: 使用亚米级卫星图像，开发了一个半监督分割框架来检测难民庇护所，然后分析WASH设施的可及性，包括性别差异分析。

Result: 难民庇护所检测的F1分数达到76.4%。WASH可及性从2022年的每设施25人下降到2025年的29.4人，女性面临更大的可及性挑战。

Conclusion: 高分辨率遥感和机器学习在检测不平等和为复杂人道主义环境中的公平资源规划提供信息方面具有重要价值，需要需求响应的分配策略来服务最需要的人群。

Abstract: Access to Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) services remains a major public health concern in refugee camps. This study introduces a remote sensing-driven framework to quantify WASH accessibility-specifically to water pumps, latrines, and bathing cubicles-in the Rohingya camps of Cox's Bazar, one of the world's most densely populated displacement settings. Detecting refugee shelters in such emergent camps presents substantial challenges, primarily due to their dense spatial configuration and irregular geometric patterns. Using sub-meter satellite images, we develop a semi-supervised segmentation framework that achieves an F1-score of 76.4% in detecting individual refugee shelters. Applying the framework across multi-year data reveals declining WASH accessibility, driven by rapid refugee population growth and reduced facility availability, rising from 25 people per facility in 2022 to 29.4 in 2025. Gender-disaggregated analysis further shows that women and girls experience reduced accessibility, in scenarios with inadequate safety-related segregation in WASH facilities. These findings suggest the importance of demand-responsive allocation strategies that can identify areas with under-served populations-such as women and girls-and ensure that limited infrastructure serves the greatest number of people in settings with fixed or shrinking budgets. We also discuss the value of high-resolution remote sensing and machine learning to detect inequality and inform equitable resource planning in complex humanitarian environments.

Conclusion: 该方法通过结构化扰动和身份锚定正则化，在结构异常检测任务中表现出色，具有实际工业应用价值。

Abstract: Anomaly detection plays a pivotal role in automated industrial inspection, aiming to identify subtle or rare defects in otherwise uniform visual patterns. As collecting representative examples of all possible anomalies is infeasible, we tackle structural anomaly detection using a self-supervised autoencoder that learns to repair corrupted inputs. To this end, we introduce a corruption model that injects artificial disruptions into training images to mimic structural defects. While reminiscent of denoising autoencoders, our approach differs in two key aspects. First, instead of unstructured i.i.d.\ noise, we apply structured, spatially coherent perturbations that make the task a hybrid of segmentation and inpainting. Second, and counterintuitively, we add and preserve Gaussian noise on top of the occlusions, which acts as a Tikhonov regularizer anchoring the Jacobian of the reconstruction function toward identity. This identity-anchored regularization stabilizes reconstruction and further improves both detection and segmentation accuracy. On the MVTec AD benchmark, our method achieves state-of-the-art results (I/P-AUROC: 99.9/99.4), supporting our theoretical framework and demonstrating its practical relevance for automatic inspection.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉-语言模型的OOD分割方法，通过结合视觉语言编码器和transformer解码器，利用距离基OOD提示和OOD语义增强，在自动驾驶场景中实现有效的异常物体分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自动驾驶和机器人领域，确保道路安全和可靠决策依赖于OOD分割。虽然已有许多方法检测道路上的异常物体，但利用视觉-语言空间提供的丰富语言知识仍是一个未被充分探索的领域。作者假设在复杂自动驾驶场景中，融入语言线索特别有益。

Method: 训练文本驱动的OOD分割模型，学习视觉-语言空间中语义多样的对象集。具体包括：结合视觉语言模型编码器与transformer解码器；使用距离基OOD提示（位于与ID类不同语义距离）；采用OOD语义增强进行OOD表示。通过对齐视觉和文本信息，有效泛化到未见对象。

Result: 在Fishyscapes、Segment-Me-If-You-Can和Road Anomaly等公开OOD分割数据集上进行广泛实验，在像素级和对象级评估中均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 结果证明了基于视觉语言的OOD分割在增强未来自动驾驶系统安全性和可靠性方面的潜力。

Abstract: In autonomous driving and robotics, ensuring road safety and reliable decision-making critically depends on out-of-distribution (OOD) segmentation. While numerous methods have been proposed to detect anomalous objects on the road, leveraging the vision-language space-which provides rich linguistic knowledge-remains an underexplored field. We hypothesize that incorporating these linguistic cues can be especially beneficial in the complex contexts found in real-world autonomous driving scenarios.
  To this end, we present a novel approach that trains a Text-Driven OOD Segmentation model to learn a semantically diverse set of objects in the vision-language space. Concretely, our approach combines a vision-language model's encoder with a transformer decoder, employs Distance-Based OOD prompts located at varying semantic distances from in-distribution (ID) classes, and utilizes OOD Semantic Augmentation for OOD representations. By aligning visual and textual information, our approach effectively generalizes to unseen objects and provides robust OOD segmentation in diverse driving environments.
  We conduct extensive experiments on publicly available OOD segmentation datasets such as Fishyscapes, Segment-Me-If-You-Can, and Road Anomaly datasets, demonstrating that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across both pixel-level and object-level evaluations. This result underscores the potential of vision-language-based OOD segmentation to bolster the safety and reliability of future autonomous driving systems.

Conclusion: 4DSTR通过空间-时间校正有效解决了4D生成中的时空一致性和快速变化适应问题，为动态4D内容生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Remarkable advances in recent 2D image and 3D shape generation have induced a significant focus on dynamic 4D content generation. However, previous 4D generation methods commonly struggle to maintain spatial-temporal consistency and adapt poorly to rapid temporal variations, due to the lack of effective spatial-temporal modeling. To address these problems, we propose a novel 4D generation network called 4DSTR, which modulates generative 4D Gaussian Splatting with spatial-temporal rectification. Specifically, temporal correlation across generated 4D sequences is designed to rectify deformable scales and rotations and guarantee temporal consistency. Furthermore, an adaptive spatial densification and pruning strategy is proposed to address significant temporal variations by dynamically adding or deleting Gaussian points with the awareness of their pre-frame movements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our 4DSTR achieves state-of-the-art performance in video-to-4D generation, excelling in reconstruction quality, spatial-temporal consistency, and adaptation to rapid temporal movements.

Abstract: The advent of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has expanded AI capabilities to visual modalities, yet existing evaluation benchmarks remain limited to single-video understanding, overlooking the critical need for multi-video understanding in real-world scenarios (e.g., sports analytics and autonomous driving). To address this significant gap, we introduce MVU-Eval, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating Multi-Video Understanding for MLLMs. Specifically, our MVU-Eval mainly assesses eight core competencies through 1,824 meticulously curated question-answer pairs spanning 4,959 videos from diverse domains, addressing both fundamental perception tasks and high-order reasoning tasks. These capabilities are rigorously aligned with real-world applications such as multi-sensor synthesis in autonomous systems and cross-angle sports analytics. Through extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source models, we reveal significant performance discrepancies and limitations in current MLLMs' ability to perform understanding across multiple videos. The benchmark will be made publicly available to foster future research.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in the areas of video captioning, search, and summarization. However, current Video-LLMs still face challenges with long real-world videos. Recent methods have introduced a retrieval mechanism that retrieves query-relevant KV caches for question answering, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of long real-world videos. However, the compression and retrieval of KV caches are still not fully explored. In this paper, we propose \textbf{StreamKV}, a training-free framework that seamlessly equips Video-LLMs with advanced KV cache retrieval and compression. Compared to previous methods that used uniform partitioning, StreamKV dynamically partitions video streams into semantic segments, which better preserves semantic information. For KV cache retrieval, StreamKV calculates a summary vector for each segment to retain segment-level information essential for retrieval. For KV cache compression, StreamKV introduces a guidance prompt designed to capture the key semantic elements within each segment, ensuring only the most informative KV caches are retained for answering questions. Moreover, StreamKV unifies KV cache retrieval and compression within a single module, performing both in a layer-adaptive manner, thereby further improving the effectiveness of streaming video question answering. Extensive experiments on public StreamingVQA benchmarks demonstrate that StreamKV significantly outperforms existing Online Video-LLMs, achieving superior accuracy while substantially improving both memory efficiency and computational latency.

Abstract: The accurate understanding of ischemic stroke lesions is critical for efficient therapy and prognosis of stroke patients. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is sensitive to acute ischemic stroke and is a common diagnostic method for stroke. However, manual lesion segmentation performed by experts is tedious, time-consuming, and prone to observer inconsistency. Automatic medical image analysis methods have been proposed to overcome this challenge. However, previous approaches have relied on hand-crafted features that may not capture the irregular and physiologically complex shapes of ischemic stroke lesions. In this study, we present a novel framework for quickly and automatically segmenting ischemic stroke lesions on various MRI sequences, including T1-weighted, T2-weighted, DWI, and FLAIR. The proposed methodology is validated on the ISLES 2015 Brain Stroke sequence dataset, where we trained our model using the Res-Unet architecture twice: first, with pre-existing weights, and then without, to explore the benefits of transfer learning. Evaluation metrics, including the Dice score and sensitivity, were computed across 3D volumes. Finally, a Majority Voting Classifier was integrated to amalgamate the outcomes from each axis, resulting in a comprehensive segmentation method. Our efforts culminated in achieving a Dice score of 80.5\% and an accuracy of 74.03\%, showcasing the efficacy of our segmentation approach.

Conclusion: LLM-based质量评估系统在低剂量CT图像质量评估中表现出色，提供数值评分和文本描述，具有临床实用性

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (CT) represents a significant improvement in patient safety through lower radiation doses, but increased noise, blur, and contrast loss can diminish diagnostic quality. Therefore, consistency and robustness in image quality assessment become essential for clinical applications. In this study, we propose an LLM-based quality assessment system that generates both numerical scores and textual descriptions of degradations such as noise, blur, and contrast loss. Furthermore, various inference strategies - from the zero-shot approach to metadata integration and error feedback - are systematically examined, demonstrating the progressive contribution of each method to overall performance. The resultant assessments yield not only highly correlated scores but also interpretable output, thereby adding value to clinical workflows.

TL;DR: VADER是一个基于大语言模型的视频异常理解框架，通过整合关键帧对象关系特征和视觉线索来增强视频异常理解能力，在多个现实世界基准测试中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频异常检测方法仅关注检测和定位异常，而忽略了更深层次的因果关系和对象间交互，这些对于理解异常行为至关重要。

Method: VADER首先使用异常评分器为每帧分配异常分数，然后通过上下文感知采样策略捕获异常事件的因果上下文。关系特征提取器和对比关系编码器共同建模动态对象交互，生成紧凑的关系表示，最后将这些视觉和关系线索与大语言模型集成。

Result: 在多个现实世界VAU基准测试中，VADER在异常描述、解释和因果推理任务上取得了强劲结果。

Conclusion: VADER推动了可解释视频异常分析的前沿，能够生成详细的、基于因果关系的描述并支持稳健的异常相关问答。

Abstract: Video anomaly understanding (VAU) aims to provide detailed interpretation and semantic comprehension of anomalous events within videos, addressing limitations of traditional methods that focus solely on detecting and localizing anomalies. However, existing approaches often neglect the deeper causal relationships and interactions between objects, which are critical for understanding anomalous behaviors. In this paper, we propose VADER, an LLM-driven framework for Video Anomaly unDErstanding, which integrates keyframe object Relation features with visual cues to enhance anomaly comprehension from video. Specifically, VADER first applies an Anomaly Scorer to assign per-frame anomaly scores, followed by a Context-AwarE Sampling (CAES) strategy to capture the causal context of each anomalous event. A Relation Feature Extractor and a COntrastive Relation Encoder (CORE) jointly model dynamic object interactions, producing compact relational representations for downstream reasoning. These visual and relational cues are integrated with LLMs to generate detailed, causally grounded descriptions and support robust anomaly-related question answering. Experiments on multiple real-world VAU benchmarks demonstrate that VADER achieves strong results across anomaly description, explanation, and causal reasoning tasks, advancing the frontier of explainable video anomaly analysis.

Conclusion: 通过利用视觉基础模型作为外部知识源，提出的框架成功解决了SFOD中的特征对齐和标签质量问题，显著提升了跨域目标检测性能。

Abstract: Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD) aims to adapt a source-pretrained object detector to a target domain without access to source data. However, existing SFOD methods predominantly rely on internal knowledge from the source model, which limits their capacity to generalize across domains and often results in biased pseudo-labels, thereby hindering both transferability and discriminability. In contrast, Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), pretrained on massive and diverse data, exhibit strong perception capabilities and broad generalization, yet their potential remains largely untapped in the SFOD setting. In this paper, we propose a novel SFOD framework that leverages VFMs as external knowledge sources to jointly enhance feature alignment and label quality. Specifically, we design three VFM-based modules: (1) Patch-weighted Global Feature Alignment (PGFA) distills global features from VFMs using patch-similarity-based weighting to enhance global feature transferability; (2) Prototype-based Instance Feature Alignment (PIFA) performs instance-level contrastive learning guided by momentum-updated VFM prototypes; and (3) Dual-source Enhanced Pseudo-label Fusion (DEPF) fuses predictions from detection VFMs and teacher models via an entropy-aware strategy to yield more reliable supervision. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art SFOD performance, validating the effectiveness of integrating VFMs to simultaneously improve transferability and discriminability.

Conclusion: YoNoSplat提供了一种高效、灵活且强大的3D场景重建解决方案，能够处理各种输入条件，并在速度和性能方面表现出色。

Abstract: Fast and flexible 3D scene reconstruction from unstructured image collections remains a significant challenge. We present YoNoSplat, a feedforward model that reconstructs high-quality 3D Gaussian Splatting representations from an arbitrary number of images. Our model is highly versatile, operating effectively with both posed and unposed, calibrated and uncalibrated inputs. YoNoSplat predicts local Gaussians and camera poses for each view, which are aggregated into a global representation using either predicted or provided poses. To overcome the inherent difficulty of jointly learning 3D Gaussians and camera parameters, we introduce a novel mixing training strategy. This approach mitigates the entanglement between the two tasks by initially using ground-truth poses to aggregate local Gaussians and gradually transitioning to a mix of predicted and ground-truth poses, which prevents both training instability and exposure bias. We further resolve the scale ambiguity problem by a novel pairwise camera-distance normalization scheme and by embedding camera intrinsics into the network. Moreover, YoNoSplat also predicts intrinsic parameters, making it feasible for uncalibrated inputs. YoNoSplat demonstrates exceptional efficiency, reconstructing a scene from 100 views (at 280x518 resolution) in just 2.69 seconds on an NVIDIA GH200 GPU. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks in both pose-free and pose-dependent settings. Our project page is at https://botaoye.github.io/yonosplat/.

The system can quickly detect and monitor dumped waste using a street-level camera and object detection algorithm. Data was collected from the Sangareddy district in Telangana, India. A series of comprehensive experiments was carried out using the proposed dataset to assess the accuracy and overall performance of various object detection models. Specifically, we performed an in-depth evaluation of YOLOv8, YOLOv10, YOLO11m, and RT-DETR on our dataset. Among these models, YOLO11m achieved the highest accuracy of 92.39\% in waste detection, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting waste. Additionally, it attains an mAP@50 of 0.91, highlighting its high precision. These findings confirm that the object detection model is well-suited for monitoring and tracking waste dumping events at GVP locations. Furthermore, the system effectively captures waste disposal patterns, including hourly, daily, and weekly dumping trends, ensuring comprehensive daily and nightly monitoring.

Conclusion: 推理时指导为在低数据红外设置中弥合领域差距提供了一个有前景的方向。

Abstract: Infrared imagery enables temperature-based scene understanding using passive sensors, particularly under conditions of low visibility where traditional RGB imaging fails. Yet, developing downstream vision models for infrared applications is hindered by the scarcity of high-quality annotated data, due to the specialized expertise required for infrared annotation. While synthetic infrared image generation has the potential to accelerate model development by providing large-scale, diverse training data, training foundation-level generative diffusion models in the infrared domain has remained elusive due to limited datasets. In light of such data constraints, we explore an inference-time scaling approach using a domain-adapted CLIP-based verifier for enhanced infrared image generation quality. We adapt FLUX.1-dev, a state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion model, to the infrared domain by finetuning it on a small sample of infrared images using parameter-efficient techniques. The trained verifier is then employed during inference to guide the diffusion sampling process toward higher quality infrared generations that better align with input text prompts. Empirically, we find that our approach leads to consistent improvements in generation quality, reducing FID scores on the KAIST Multispectral Pedestrian Detection Benchmark dataset by 10% compared to unguided baseline samples. Our results suggest that inference-time guidance offers a promising direction for bridging the domain gap in low-data infrared settings.

Abstract: LiDAR super-resolution addresses the challenge of achieving high-quality 3D perception from cost-effective, low-resolution sensors. While recent transformer-based approaches like TULIP show promise, they remain limited to spatial-domain processing with restricted receptive fields. We introduce FLASH (Frequency-aware LiDAR Adaptive Super-resolution with Hierarchical fusion), a novel framework that overcomes these limitations through dual-domain processing. FLASH integrates two key innovations: (i) Frequency-Aware Window Attention that combines local spatial attention with global frequency-domain analysis via FFT, capturing both fine-grained geometry and periodic scanning patterns at log-linear complexity. (ii) Adaptive Multi-Scale Fusion that replaces conventional skip connections with learned position-specific feature aggregation, enhanced by CBAM attention for dynamic feature selection. Extensive experiments on KITTI demonstrate that FLASH achieves state-of-the-art performance across all evaluation metrics, surpassing even uncertainty-enhanced baselines that require multiple forward passes. Notably, FLASH outperforms TULIP with Monte Carlo Dropout while maintaining single-pass efficiency, which enables real-time deployment. The consistent superiority across all distance ranges validates that our dual-domain approach effectively handles uncertainty through architectural design rather than computationally expensive stochastic inference, making it practical for autonomous systems.

Abstract: Generative models are reshaping the live-streaming industry by redefining how content is created, styled, and delivered. Previous image-based streaming diffusion models have powered efficient and creative live streaming products but have hit limits on temporal consistency due to the foundation of image-based designs. Recent advances in video diffusion have markedly improved temporal consistency and sampling efficiency for offline generation. However, offline generation systems primarily optimize throughput by batching large workloads. In contrast, live online streaming operates under strict service-level objectives (SLOs): time-to-first-frame must be minimal, and every frame must meet a per-frame deadline with low jitter. Besides, scalable multi-GPU serving for real-time streams remains largely unresolved so far. To address this, we present StreamDiffusionV2, a training-free pipeline for interactive live streaming with video diffusion models. StreamDiffusionV2 integrates an SLO-aware batching scheduler and a block scheduler, together with a sink-token--guided rolling KV cache, a motion-aware noise controller, and other system-level optimizations. Moreover, we introduce a scalable pipeline orchestration that parallelizes the diffusion process across denoising steps and network layers, achieving near-linear FPS scaling without violating latency guarantees. The system scales seamlessly across heterogeneous GPU environments and supports flexible denoising steps (e.g., 1--4), enabling both ultra-low-latency and higher-quality modes. Without TensorRT or quantization, StreamDiffusionV2 renders the first frame within 0.5s and attains 58.28 FPS with a 14B-parameter model and 64.52 FPS with a 1.3B-parameter model on four H100 GPUs, making state-of-the-art generative live streaming practical and accessible--from individual creators to enterprise-scale platforms.

Abstract: We present DIMO, a generative approach capable of generating diverse 3D motions for arbitrary objects from a single image. The core idea of our work is to leverage the rich priors in well-trained video models to extract the common motion patterns and then embed them into a shared low-dimensional latent space. Specifically, we first generate multiple videos of the same object with diverse motions. We then embed each motion into a latent vector and train a shared motion decoder to learn the distribution of motions represented by a structured and compact motion representation, i.e., neural key point trajectories. The canonical 3D Gaussians are then driven by these key points and fused to model the geometry and appearance. During inference time with learned latent space, we can instantly sample diverse 3D motions in a single-forward pass and support several interesting applications including 3D motion interpolation and language-guided motion generation.

Abstract: Developing embodied AI for intelligent surgical systems requires safe, controllable environments for continual learning and evaluation. However, safety regulations and operational constraints in operating rooms (ORs) limit embodied agents from freely perceiving and interacting in realistic settings. Digital twins provide high-fidelity, risk-free environments for exploration and training. How we may create photorealistic and dynamic digital representations of ORs that capture relevant spatial, visual, and behavioral complexity remains unclear. We introduce TwinOR, a framework for constructing photorealistic, dynamic digital twins of ORs for embodied AI research. The system reconstructs static geometry from pre-scan videos and continuously models human and equipment motion through multi-view perception of OR activities. The static and dynamic components are fused into an immersive 3D environment that supports controllable simulation and embodied exploration. The proposed framework reconstructs complete OR geometry with centimeter level accuracy while preserving dynamic interaction across surgical workflows, enabling realistic renderings and a virtual playground for embodied AI systems. In our experiments, TwinOR simulates stereo and monocular sensor streams for geometry understanding and visual localization tasks. Models such as FoundationStereo and ORB-SLAM3 on TwinOR-synthesized data achieve performance within their reported accuracy on real indoor datasets, demonstrating that TwinOR provides sensor-level realism sufficient for perception and localization challenges. By establishing a real-to-sim pipeline for constructing dynamic, photorealistic digital twins of OR environments, TwinOR enables the safe, scalable, and data-efficient development and benchmarking of embodied AI, ultimately accelerating the deployment of embodied AI from sim-to-real.

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一的语音框架Ming-UniAudio，通过连续语音分词器MingTok-Audio整合语义和声学特征，解决了语音理解与生成任务中表征冲突的问题，并进一步开发了首个仅通过自然语言指令实现自由形式语音编辑的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音模型在理解和生成任务上存在表征需求冲突，这种表征差异阻碍了语音语言模型执行基于指令的自由形式编辑。

Method: 开发了统一的连续语音分词器MingTok-Audio，整合语义和声学特征；基于此构建了语音语言模型Ming-UniAudio；进一步训练了专门的语音编辑模型Ming-UniAudio-Edit；并创建了首个自由形式语音编辑基准Ming-Freeform-Audio-Edit。

Result: 在ContextASR基准测试中，12个指标中有8个达到新的SOTA；中文语音克隆的Seed-TTS-WER达到0.95；实现了首个仅通过自然语言指令的通用自由形式语音编辑。

Conclusion: 该框架成功统一了语音理解、生成和编辑，解决了表征冲突问题，为统一音频理解、生成和操作的发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Existing speech models suffer from competing requirements on token representations by understanding and generation tasks. This discrepancy in representation prevents speech language models from performing instruction-based free-form editing. To solve this challenge, we introduce a novel framework that unifies speech understanding, generation, and editing. The core of our unified model is a unified continuous speech tokenizer MingTok-Audio, the first continuous tokenizer to effectively integrate semantic and acoustic features, which makes it suitable for both understanding and generation tasks. Based on this unified continuous audio tokenizer, we developed the speech language model Ming-UniAudio, which achieved a balance between generation and understanding capabilities. Ming-UniAudio sets new state-of-the-art (SOTA) records on 8 out of 12 metrics on the ContextASR benchmark. Notably, for Chinese voice cloning, it achieves a highly competitive Seed-TTS-WER of 0.95. Leveraging this foundational model, we further trained a dedicated speech editing model Ming-UniAudio-Edit, the first speech language model that enables universal, free-form speech editing guided solely by natural language instructions, handling both semantic and acoustic modifications without timestamp condition. To rigorously assess the editing capability and establish a foundation for future research, we introduce Ming-Freeform-Audio-Edit, the first comprehensive benchmark tailored for instruction-based free-form speech editing, featuring diverse scenarios and evaluation dimensions spanning semantic correctness, acoustic quality, and instruction alignment. We open-sourced the continuous audio tokenizer, the unified foundational model, and the free-form instruction-based editing model to facilitate the development of unified audio understanding, generation, and manipulation.

TL;DR: 提出Confusion-Inducing Attacks (CIA)框架，通过最大化模型不确定性来提取记忆数据，在多种LLMs上优于现有基线方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的训练数据记忆化带来隐私和版权问题，现有数据提取方法成功率有限且对记忆泄露机制理解不足

Method: CIA框架通过优化输入片段故意诱导连续高熵状态；对对齐LLMs提出Mismatched SFT同时削弱对齐并诱导目标混淆

Result: 在多种未对齐和对齐LLMs上实验表明，该方法在提取逐字和近逐字训练数据方面优于现有基线，无需训练数据先验知识

Conclusion: 研究揭示了各种LLMs中持续存在的记忆化风险，并提供了更系统评估这些漏洞的方法

Abstract: The memorization of training data in large language models (LLMs) poses significant privacy and copyright concerns. Existing data extraction methods, particularly heuristic-based divergence attacks, often exhibit limited success and offer limited insight into the fundamental drivers of memorization leakage. This paper introduces Confusion-Inducing Attacks (CIA), a principled framework for extracting memorized data by systematically maximizing model uncertainty. We empirically demonstrate that the emission of memorized text during divergence is preceded by a sustained spike in token-level prediction entropy. CIA leverages this insight by optimizing input snippets to deliberately induce this consecutive high-entropy state. For aligned LLMs, we further propose Mismatched Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) to simultaneously weaken their alignment and induce targeted confusion, thereby increasing susceptibility to our attacks. Experiments on various unaligned and aligned LLMs demonstrate that our proposed attacks outperform existing baselines in extracting verbatim and near-verbatim training data without requiring prior knowledge of the training data. Our findings highlight persistent memorization risks across various LLMs and offer a more systematic method for assessing these vulnerabilities.

TL;DR: 提出基于上下文学习的基础模型框架，统一检测毒性、垃圾信息和负面情绪，支持轻量级个性化定制而无需重新训练模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有内容审核系统存在中心化、任务特定、透明度有限且忽略用户偏好等问题，不适合隐私敏感或去中心化环境

Method: 利用基础模型的上下文学习能力，通过提示工程实现多任务检测，支持用户通过简单提示干预进行个性化定制

Result: 基础模型在跨任务泛化方面表现优异，匹配或超越任务特定微调模型；仅需1个用户示例即可有效个性化；增强提示可显著提升对噪声数据的鲁棒性

Conclusion: 该工作展示了超越一刀切审核的明确转变，确立了上下文学习作为实用、隐私保护且高度适配的用户中心内容安全系统新途径

Abstract: The proliferation of harmful online content--e.g., toxicity, spam, and negative sentiment--demands robust and adaptable moderation systems. However, prevailing moderation systems are centralized and task-specific, offering limited transparency and neglecting diverse user preferences--an approach ill-suited for privacy-sensitive or decentralized environments. We propose a novel framework that leverages in-context learning (ICL) with foundation models to unify the detection of toxicity, spam, and negative sentiment across binary, multi-class, and multi-label settings. Crucially, our approach enables lightweight personalization, allowing users to easily block new categories, unblock existing ones, or extend detection to semantic variations through simple prompt-based interventions--all without model retraining. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks (TextDetox, UCI SMS, SST2) and a new, annotated Mastodon dataset reveal that: (i) foundation models achieve strong cross-task generalization, often matching or surpassing task-specific fine-tuned models; (ii) effective personalization is achievable with as few as one user-provided example or definition; and (iii) augmenting prompts with label definitions or rationales significantly enhances robustness to noisy, real-world data. Our work demonstrates a definitive shift beyond one-size-fits-all moderation, establishing ICL as a practical, privacy-preserving, and highly adaptable pathway for the next generation of user-centric content safety systems. To foster reproducibility and facilitate future research, we publicly release our code on GitHub and the annotated Mastodon dataset on Hugging Face.

We present MCP4IFC, a comprehensive open-source framework that enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to directly manipulate Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) data through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The framework provides a set of BIM tools, including scene querying tools for information retrieval, predefined functions for creating and modifying common building elements, and a dynamic code-generation system that combines in-context learning with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to handle tasks beyond the predefined toolset. Experiments demonstrate that an LLM using our framework can successfully perform complex tasks, from building a simple house to querying and editing existing IFC data. Our framework is released as open-source to encourage research in LLM-driven BIM design and provide a foundation for AI-assisted modeling workflows.

TL;DR: FlowMM是一个跨模态信息流引导的多模态KV缓存合并框架，通过层特定合并策略和敏感度自适应令牌匹配，在减少80-95% KV缓存内存和1.3-1.8倍解码延迟的同时保持任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统KV缓存淘汰策略会降低生成质量，而现有的KV合并方法在多模态场景中受限于模态间分布偏差和注意力偏差，效果有限。

Method: 利用跨模态信息流动态应用层特定合并策略，引入敏感度自适应令牌匹配机制，联合评估令牌相似性和任务关键敏感度。

Result: 在多种领先MLLM上的实验表明，FlowMM减少KV缓存内存80-95%，解码延迟降低1.3-1.8倍，同时保持竞争力的任务性能。

Conclusion: FlowMM通过跨模态信息流引导的KV缓存合并，有效解决了多模态场景中的缓存效率问题，在显著减少内存和延迟的同时保持了生成质量。

Abstract: Traditional KV cache eviction strategies, which discard less critical KV-pairs based on attention scores, often degrade generation quality, causing context loss or hallucinations. Recent efforts shift toward KV merging, merging eviction tokens with retention tokens based on similarity. However, in multimodal scenarios, distributional biases across modality tokens and attentional biases in cross-modal interactions limit its effectiveness. This work introduces FlowMM, an adaptive framework for cross-modal information flow-guided multimodal KV cache merging. FlowMM leverages cross-modal information flow to dynamically apply layer-specific merging strategies, capturing modality-specific patterns while preserving contextual integrity. Furthermore, we introduce a sensitivity-adaptive token matching mechanism that jointly evaluates token similarity and task-critical sensitivity, merging low-risk tokens while safeguarding high-sensitivity ones. Extensive experiments across diverse leading MLLMs show that FlowMM reduces KV cache memory by 80% to 95% and decoding latency by 1.3-1.8x, while maintaining competitive task performance.

TL;DR: 该研究量化了AI生成内容对语言多样性的影响，通过分析2013-2025年维基百科文本的语义相似性变化，发现LLM公开采用后语义相似性呈指数增长，预测了递归AI训练可能导致模型崩溃的风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI生成内容在网络中占比迅速增长（新网页74.2%包含AI内容，30-40%网络语料为合成内容），递归训练可能侵蚀语言和语义多样性，导致模型崩溃问题。

Method: 使用Transformer嵌入和余弦相似度指标，分析2013-2025年英语维基百科（过滤自Common Crawl）的年际语义相似性变化。

Result: 在LLM公开采用前语义相似性稳步上升（受早期RNN/LSTM翻译和文本规范化影响），LLM采用后相似性呈指数增长，波动反映了语言多样性、语料库规模变化和采样误差。

Conclusion: 研究提供了数据驱动的估计，表明递归AI污染可能显著威胁数据丰富性和模型泛化能力，需要关注AI内容对训练数据质量的影响。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence, especially Large Language Models (LLMs), has transformed domains such as software engineering, journalism, creative writing, academia, and media (Naveed et al. 2025; arXiv:2307.06435). Diffusion models like Stable Diffusion generate high-quality images and videos from text. Evidence shows rapid expansion: 74.2% of newly published webpages now contain AI-generated material (Ryan Law 2025), 30-40% of the active web corpus is synthetic (Spennemann 2025; arXiv:2504.08755), 52% of U.S. adults use LLMs for writing, coding, or research (Staff 2025), and audits find AI involvement in 18% of financial complaints and 24% of press releases (Liang et al. 2025). The underlying neural architectures, including Transformers (Vaswani et al. 2023; arXiv:1706.03762), RNNs, LSTMs, GANs, and diffusion networks, depend on large, diverse, human-authored datasets (Shi & Iyengar 2019). As synthetic content dominates, recursive training risks eroding linguistic and semantic diversity, producing Model Collapse (Shumailov et al. 2024; arXiv:2307.15043; Dohmatob et al. 2024; arXiv:2402.07712). This study quantifies and forecasts collapse onset by examining year-wise semantic similarity in English-language Wikipedia (filtered Common Crawl) from 2013 to 2025 using Transformer embeddings and cosine similarity metrics. Results reveal a steady rise in similarity before public LLM adoption, likely driven by early RNN/LSTM translation and text-normalization pipelines, though modest due to a smaller scale. Observed fluctuations reflect irreducible linguistic diversity, variable corpus size across years, finite sampling error, and an exponential rise in similarity after the public adoption of LLM models. These findings provide a data-driven estimate of when recursive AI contamination may significantly threaten data richness and model generalization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了时间稀疏自编码器（T-SAEs），通过引入对比损失来鼓励相邻token间高级特征的一致性激活，从而在无监督条件下分离语义和句法特征，解决了传统SAEs偏向浅层、token特定或噪声特征的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统稀疏自编码器（SAEs）在发现人类可解释特征时存在系统性失败，倾向于捕获浅层、token特定或噪声特征，而忽略了语言丰富的概念信息。这主要是由于当前无监督方法忽视了语言本身的结构知识。

Method: 基于语言中语义内容具有长程依赖性和序列平滑性，而句法信息更局部的洞察，提出了T-SAEs，引入新颖的对比损失来鼓励相邻token间高级特征的一致性激活，以自监督方式分离语义和句法特征。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上，T-SAEs能够恢复更平滑、更连贯的语义概念，且不牺牲重构质量。尽管没有显式语义信号训练，T-SAEs仍展现出清晰的语义结构。

Conclusion: T-SAEs为语言模型的无监督可解释性提供了新途径，通过简单而强大的修改实现了语义和句法特征的有效分离。

Abstract: Translating the internal representations and computations of models into concepts that humans can understand is a key goal of interpretability. While recent dictionary learning methods such as Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) provide a promising route to discover human-interpretable features, they suffer from a variety of problems, including a systematic failure to capture the rich conceptual information that drives linguistic understanding. Instead, they exhibit a bias towards shallow, token-specific, or noisy features, such as "the phrase 'The' at the start of sentences". In this work, we propose that this is due to a fundamental issue with how dictionary learning methods for LLMs are trained. Language itself has a rich, well-studied structure spanning syntax, semantics, and pragmatics; however, current unsupervised methods largely ignore this linguistic knowledge, leading to poor feature discovery that favors superficial patterns over meaningful concepts. We focus on a simple but important aspect of language: semantic content has long-range dependencies and tends to be smooth over a sequence, whereas syntactic information is much more local. Building on this insight, we introduce Temporal Sparse Autoencoders (T-SAEs), which incorporate a novel contrastive loss encouraging consistent activations of high-level features over adjacent tokens. This simple yet powerful modification enables SAEs to disentangle semantic from syntactic features in a self-supervised manner. Across multiple datasets and models, T-SAEs recover smoother, more coherent semantic concepts without sacrificing reconstruction quality. Strikingly, they exhibit clear semantic structure despite being trained without explicit semantic signal, offering a new pathway for unsupervised interpretability in language models.

Method: 用线性时间mLSTM替换自注意力机制，结合短卷积、带动态调制的滑动窗口注意力和Hedgehog特征映射等轻量级增强技术，并使用Muon优化器替代AdamW。

Result: 在STRICT和STRICT-SMALL赛道上的实验表明：(1) 线性注意力与滑动窗口注意力结合持续提升零样本性能；(2) Muon优化器比AdamW更稳定收敛并降低困惑度。

Conclusion: 这些结果凸显了在不依赖规模的情况下实现高效语言建模的有效策略。

Abstract: We study architectural and optimization techniques for sample-efficient language modeling under the constraints of the BabyLM 2025 shared task. Our model, BLaLM, replaces self-attention with a linear-time mLSTM token mixer and explores lightweight enhancements, including short convolutions, sliding window attention with dynamic modulation, and Hedgehog feature maps. To support training in low-resource settings, we curate a high-quality corpus emphasizing readability and pedagogical structure. Experiments across both STRICT and STRICT-SMALL tracks show that (1) linear attention combined with sliding window attention consistently improves zero-shot performance, and (2) the Muon optimizer stabilizes convergence and reduces perplexity over AdamW. These results highlight effective strategies for efficient language modeling without relying on scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决子词分词中代码点与字节方法的权衡问题：代码点方法需要大量初始词汇但保证UTF-8有效性，字节方法词汇小但可能产生无效UTF-8序列，这会导致依赖UTF-8假设的代码崩溃。

Method: 使用幺半群理论形式化分词过程，证明包含无效UTF-8标记的分词器必然产生无效UTF-8序列，并分析增量解码与整体解码的不一致性。

Result: 形式化结果预测了现实世界中的bug，评估了现有缓解措施，并对主要基础模型、服务引擎和受限生成系统进行了案例研究。

Conclusion: 包含无效UTF-8标记的分词器存在固有缺陷，增量解码与整体解码的不一致性会导致实际系统bug，需要专门处理此类问题。

Abstract: Subword tokenization segments input text according to a pre-defined vocabulary to feed it into a language model; the language model, in turn, generates a sequence made from this same vocabulary. The members of the vocabulary can be built of code points or bytes. Using code points means that all members of the vocabulary are valid UTF-8 characters. However, it also requires thousands of initial members to achieve acceptable coverage of inputs. Beginning with bytes, on the contrary, avoids out-of-vocabulary errors with only 256 initial members of the vocabulary, but the members of the vocabulary and sequences of them are not guaranteed to be valid UTF-8. Sequences that are not valid UTF-8 break code that assumes its input to be valid UTF-8. Applications of language models must account for the breakage thereby introduced. In this paper, we formalize tokenization using monoid theory and prove that tokenizers whose vocabularies contain tokens that are ill-formed UTF-8 can always produce sequences that are ill-formed UTF-8. We demonstrate formally that attempting to incrementally convert tokens back to a string and interpret the results as UTF-8 gives different results than converting the whole sequence of tokens at once. This formal result predicts real-world bugs: we evaluate mitigations for the problem identified and provide case studies of major foundation models, serving engines, and constrained generation systems.

Result: 在三个开放生成任务和13个指标上，BACo始终优于最先进的推理时基线方法，人类评估也证实了这些改进

Conclusion: 基础模型和对齐模型之间的协作可以优化和控制多样性与质量

Abstract: Alignment has greatly improved large language models (LLMs)' output quality at the cost of diversity, yielding highly similar outputs across generations. We propose Base-Aligned Model Collaboration (BACo), an inference-time token-level model collaboration framework that dynamically combines a base LLM with its aligned counterpart to optimize diversity and quality. Inspired by prior work (Fei et al., 2025), BACo employs routing strategies that determine, at each token, from which model to decode based on next-token prediction uncertainty and predicted contents' semantic role. Prior diversity-promoting methods, such as retraining, prompt engineering, and multi-sampling methods, improve diversity but often degrade quality or require costly decoding or post-training. In contrast, BACo achieves both high diversity and quality post hoc within a single pass, while offering strong controllability. We explore a family of routing strategies, across three open-ended generation tasks and 13 metrics covering diversity and quality, BACo consistently surpasses state-of-the-art inference-time baselines. With our best router, BACo achieves a 21.3% joint improvement in diversity and quality. Human evaluations also mirror these improvements. The results suggest that collaboration between base and aligned models can optimize and control diversity and quality.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large language models such as GPT-4, Claude 3, and the Gemini series have improved automated reasoning and code generation. However, existing benchmarks mainly focus on accuracy and output quality, and they ignore an important factor: decoding token efficiency. In real systems, generating 10,000 tokens versus 100,000 tokens leads to large differences in latency, cost, and energy. In this work, we introduce OckBench, a model-agnostic and hardware-agnostic benchmark that evaluates both accuracy and token count for reasoning and coding tasks. Through experiments comparing multiple open- and closed-source models, we uncover that many models with comparable accuracy differ wildly in token consumption, revealing that efficiency variance is a neglected but significant axis of differentiation. We further demonstrate Pareto frontiers over the accuracy-efficiency plane and argue for an evaluation paradigm shift: we should no longer treat tokens as "free" to multiply. OckBench provides a unified platform for measuring, comparing, and guiding research in token-efficient reasoning. Our benchmarks are available at https://ockbench.github.io/ .

TL;DR: Hapax方法通过抑制归纳复制训练Transformer，发现归纳复制并非抽象性上下文学习能力的必要条件


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Transformer在抑制归纳复制的情况下是否仍能获得上下文学习能力，挑战了归纳复制是复杂上下文学习能力前提的传统观点

Method: 提出Hapax训练设置，在损失计算中省略能够被归纳头正确预测的token，从而抑制归纳复制行为

Result: 尽管归纳复制显著减少（31.7%的token被省略），模型在抽象性上下文学习任务上的表现与基线相当，在21个任务中的13个表现更好，且在无法被归纳头预测的位置损失更低

Conclusion: 归纳复制对于学习抽象性上下文学习机制并非必需，模型可以通过其他机制获得上下文学习能力

Abstract: Induction heads are attention heads that perform inductive copying by matching patterns from earlier context and copying their continuations verbatim. As models develop induction heads, they often experience a sharp drop in training loss, a phenomenon cited as evidence that induction heads may serve as a prerequisite for more complex in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. In this work, we ask whether transformers can still acquire ICL capabilities when inductive copying is suppressed. We propose Hapax, a setting where we omit the loss contribution of any token that can be correctly predicted by induction heads. Despite a significant reduction in inductive copying, performance on abstractive ICL tasks (i.e., tasks where the answer is not contained in the input context) remains comparable and surpasses the vanilla model on 13 of 21 tasks, even though 31.7\% of tokens are omitted from the loss. Furthermore, our model achieves lower loss values on token positions that cannot be predicted correctly by induction heads. Mechanistic analysis further shows that models trained with Hapax develop fewer and weaker induction heads but still preserve ICL capabilities. Taken together, our findings indicate that inductive copying is not essential for learning abstractive ICL mechanisms.

Abstract: This study investigates a hybrid method for text classification that integrates deep feature extraction from large language models, multi-scale fusion through feature pyramids, and structured modeling with graph neural networks to enhance performance in complex semantic contexts. First, the large language model captures contextual dependencies and deep semantic representations of the input text, providing a rich feature foundation for subsequent modeling. Then, based on multi-level feature representations, the feature pyramid mechanism effectively integrates semantic features of different scales, balancing global information and local details to construct hierarchical semantic expressions. Furthermore, the fused features are transformed into graph representations, and graph neural networks are employed to capture latent semantic relations and logical dependencies in the text, enabling comprehensive modeling of complex interactions among semantic units. On this basis, the readout and classification modules generate the final category predictions. The proposed method demonstrates significant advantages in robustness alignment experiments, outperforming existing models on ACC, F1-Score, AUC, and Precision, which verifies the effectiveness and stability of the framework. This study not only constructs an integrated framework that balances global and local information as well as semantics and structure, but also provides a new perspective for multi-scale feature fusion and structured semantic modeling in text classification tasks.

In this work, we show that even for simple and well-studied language families -- such as regular and context-free languages -- the number of examples required for successful generation can be extraordinarily large, and in some cases not bounded by any computable function. These results reveal a substantial gap between theoretical possibility and efficient learnability. They suggest that explaining the empirical success of modern language models requires a refined perspective -- one that takes into account structural properties of natural language that make effective generation possible in practice.

### [232] [DRAGON: Guard LLM Unlearning in Context via Negative Detection and Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05784)
*Yaxuan Wang,Chris Yuhao Liu,Quan Liu,Jinglong Pang,Wei Wei,Yujia Bao,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了DRAGON框架，一种基于推理的大语言模型遗忘方法，通过上下文思维链指令来保护部署的LLMs，无需修改基础模型或保留数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有遗忘方法通常需要微调和保留数据，但在实际场景中保留数据往往不可得，需要开发更实用的数据受限场景下的遗忘方案。

Method: 利用LLMs固有的指令遵循能力，引入轻量级检测模块识别需要遗忘的提示，然后通过专门的CoT保护模型进行上下文干预，无需保留数据。

Result: 在三个代表性遗忘任务上的广泛实验验证了DRAGON的有效性，展示了其强大的遗忘能力、可扩展性和实际场景适用性。

Conclusion: DRAGON框架提供了一种系统性的、基于推理的遗忘方法，在数据受限的实际场景中表现出色，无需修改基础模型或依赖保留数据。

Abstract: Unlearning in Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for protecting private data and removing harmful knowledge. Most existing approaches rely on fine-tuning to balance unlearning efficiency with general language capabilities. However, these methods typically require training or access to retain data, which is often unavailable in real world scenarios. Although these methods can perform well when both forget and retain data are available, few works have demonstrated equivalent capability in more practical, data-limited scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose Detect-Reasoning Augmented GeneratiON (DRAGON), a systematic, reasoning-based framework that utilizes in-context chain-of-thought (CoT) instructions to guard deployed LLMs before inference. Instead of modifying the base model, DRAGON leverages the inherent instruction-following ability of LLMs and introduces a lightweight detection module to identify forget-worthy prompts without any retain data. These are then routed through a dedicated CoT guard model to enforce safe and accurate in-context intervention. To robustly evaluate unlearning performance, we introduce novel metrics for unlearning performance and the continual unlearning setting. Extensive experiments across three representative unlearning tasks validate the effectiveness of DRAGON, demonstrating its strong unlearning capability, scalability, and applicability in practical scenarios.

*Yinjie Cheng,Paul Youssef,Christin Seifert,Jörg Schlötterer,Zhixue Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了知识编辑后的模型在微调过程中编辑效果的保持情况，发现编辑会随着微调而衰减，不同配置下衰减程度不同，并提出了选择性层微调策略来有效移除编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于解决知识编辑与微调结合时的实际问题：如果微调会损害编辑效果，那么每次微调后都需要重新编辑，成本高昂；如果编辑持续存在，微调模型可能传播恶意编辑，存在安全隐患。

Method: 评估了两种最先进的编辑方法（MEMIT、AlphaEdit）和三种微调方法（全参数、LoRA、DoRA），在五个LLM和三个数据集上进行了232个实验配置，并提出了选择性层微调策略。

Result: 结果显示编辑在微调后会衰减，AlphaEdit的编辑比MEMIT衰减更多；选择性层微调可以有效移除编辑，但会轻微影响下游性能；令人惊讶的是，仅微调未编辑层比全微调损害更多编辑。

Conclusion: 本研究为知识编辑与微调的整合建立了实证基准和可行策略，强调评估模型编辑需要考虑完整的LLM应用流程。

Abstract: Knowledge editing has emerged as a lightweight alternative to retraining for correcting or injecting specific facts in large language models (LLMs). Meanwhile, fine-tuning remains the default operation for adapting LLMs to new domains and tasks. Despite their widespread adoption, these two post-training interventions have been studied in isolation, leaving open a crucial question: if we fine-tune an edited model, do the edits survive? This question is motivated by two practical scenarios: removing covert or malicious edits, and preserving beneficial edits. If fine-tuning impairs edits as shown in Figure 1, current KE methods become less useful, as every fine-tuned model would require re-editing, which significantly increases the cost; if edits persist, fine-tuned models risk propagating hidden malicious edits, raising serious safety concerns. To this end, we systematically quantify edits decay after fine-tuning, investigating how fine-tuning affects knowledge editing. We evaluate two state-of-the-art editing methods (MEMIT, AlphaEdit) and three fine-tuning approaches (full-parameter, LoRA, DoRA) across five LLMs and three datasets, yielding 232 experimental configurations. Our results show that edits decay after fine-tuning, with survival varying across configurations, e.g., AlphaEdit edits decay more than MEMIT edits. Further, we propose selective-layer fine-tuning and find that fine-tuning edited layers only can effectively remove edits, though at a slight cost to downstream performance. Surprisingly, fine-tuning non-edited layers impairs more edits than full fine-tuning. Overall, our study establishes empirical baselines and actionable strategies for integrating knowledge editing with fine-tuning, and underscores that evaluating model editing requires considering the full LLM application pipeline.

TL;DR: 本文综述了医学领域中的检索增强生成(RAG)技术应用现状，发现该领域仍处于早期阶段，主要依赖公开数据，在私有数据应用有限，评估方法不够全面，需要临床验证、跨语言适应和低资源环境支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学知识的快速增长和临床实践的复杂性带来了挑战，大型语言模型(LLMs)虽有价值但存在固有局限，RAG技术有望增强其在临床环境中的适用性。

Method: 通过文献综述方法，分析医学领域RAG应用的研究现状，包括数据来源、检索方法、LLM类型和评估方式。

Result: 研究发现RAG应用主要依赖公开数据，检索方法常用英语中心嵌入模型，LLM多为通用模型而非医学专用，评估主要关注生成质量和任务性能，对偏见和安全性的关注不足，应用集中在问答、报告生成、文本摘要和信息提取。

Conclusion: 医学RAG仍处于早期阶段，需要在临床验证、跨语言适应和低资源环境支持方面取得进展，以实现可信赖和负责任的全球应用。

Abstract: The rapid growth of medical knowledge and increasing complexity of clinical practice pose challenges. In this context, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated value; however, inherent limitations remain. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technologies show potential to enhance their clinical applicability. This study reviewed RAG applications in medicine. We found that research primarily relied on publicly available data, with limited application in private data. For retrieval, approaches commonly relied on English-centric embedding models, while LLMs were mostly generic, with limited use of medical-specific LLMs. For evaluation, automated metrics evaluated generation quality and task performance, whereas human evaluation focused on accuracy, completeness, relevance, and fluency, with insufficient attention to bias and safety. RAG applications were concentrated on question answering, report generation, text summarization, and information extraction. Overall, medical RAG remains at an early stage, requiring advances in clinical validation, cross-linguistic adaptation, and support for low-resource settings to enable trustworthy and responsible global use.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NILC是一个针对新意图发现(NID)的迭代聚类框架，通过结合大语言模型(LLMs)来增强聚类质心和处理困难样本，在无监督和半监督设置下显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NID方法采用级联架构，无法利用两个步骤的反馈进行相互优化，且仅基于嵌入的聚类忽略了细微的文本语义，导致性能不佳。

Method: NILC采用迭代工作流程，利用LLMs创建额外的语义质心来丰富嵌入的欧几里得质心，并通过重写处理聚类中的困难样本进行聚类校正。在半监督设置中，还使用种子技术和软必须链接注入监督信号。

Result: 在六个不同领域的基准数据集上，NILC在无监督和半监督设置下相比多个最新基线方法均取得了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: NILC通过结合LLMs的语义增强和迭代优化，有效解决了现有NID方法的局限性，为新意图发现提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: New intent discovery (NID) seeks to recognize both new and known intents from unlabeled user utterances, which finds prevalent use in practical dialogue systems. Existing works towards NID mainly adopt a cascaded architecture, wherein the first stage focuses on encoding the utterances into informative text embeddings beforehand, while the latter is to group similar embeddings into clusters (i.e., intents), typically by K-Means. However, such a cascaded pipeline fails to leverage the feedback from both steps for mutual refinement, and, meanwhile, the embedding-only clustering overlooks nuanced textual semantics, leading to suboptimal performance. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes NILC, a novel clustering framework specially catered for effective NID. Particularly, NILC follows an iterative workflow, in which clustering assignments are judiciously updated by carefully refining cluster centroids and text embeddings of uncertain utterances with the aid of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, NILC first taps into LLMs to create additional semantic centroids for clusters, thereby enriching the contextual semantics of the Euclidean centroids of embeddings. Moreover, LLMs are then harnessed to augment hard samples (ambiguous or terse utterances) identified from clusters via rewriting for subsequent cluster correction. Further, we inject supervision signals through non-trivial techniques seeding and soft must links for more accurate NID in the semi-supervised setting. Extensive experiments comparing NILC against multiple recent baselines under both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings showcase that NILC can achieve significant performance improvements over six benchmark datasets of diverse domains consistently.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IDALC是一个半监督框架，用于检测用户意图并修正系统拒绝的话语，同时最小化人工标注需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音对话系统存在局限性：已知意图但置信度低时会被拒绝，需要手动标注；随着时间推移需要从系统拒绝的查询中训练新意图，但标注所有新兴意图和拒绝话语不现实。

Method: 提出IDALC框架，结合意图检测和主动学习校正，采用半监督方法减少人工标注。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，IDALC比基线方法准确率提高5-10%，宏F1提高4-8%，仅需6-10%未标注数据的标注成本。

Conclusion: IDALC能有效检测用户意图并修正系统拒绝话语，显著减少标注成本，提升系统性能。

Abstract: Voice-controlled dialog systems have become immensely popular due to their ability to perform a wide range of actions in response to diverse user queries. These agents possess a predefined set of skills or intents to fulfill specific user tasks. But every system has its own limitations. There are instances where, even for known intents, if any model exhibits low confidence, it results in rejection of utterances that necessitate manual annotation. Additionally, as time progresses, there may be a need to retrain these agents with new intents from the system-rejected queries to carry out additional tasks. Labeling all these emerging intents and rejected utterances over time is impractical, thus calling for an efficient mechanism to reduce annotation costs. In this paper, we introduce IDALC (Intent Detection and Active Learning based Correction), a semi-supervised framework designed to detect user intents and rectify system-rejected utterances while minimizing the need for human annotation. Empirical findings on various benchmark datasets demonstrate that our system surpasses baseline methods, achieving a 5-10% higher accuracy and a 4-8% improvement in macro-F1. Remarkably, we maintain the overall annotation cost at just 6-10% of the unlabelled data available to the system. The overall framework of IDALC is shown in Fig. 1

*Renfei Zhang,Manasa Kaniselvan,Niloofar Mireshghallah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 强化学习增强的语言模型在知识召回任务中表现优于基础模型和SFT模型，特别是在需要遍历结构化知识的任务上。这种优势源于改进的程序性技能而非新知识，通过结构化提示可以缩小性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战传统观点，即强化学习会损害语言模型的记忆知识，探索RL模型在知识召回任务中的实际表现。

Method: 比较RL模型与基础模型、SFT模型在知识召回任务上的表现，使用结构化提示测试，并进行层间激活分析。

Result: RL模型在结构化知识召回任务中表现更好，结构化提示可显著缩小SFT与RL模型的性能差距，RL主要改变知识遍历方式而非知识表示本身。

Conclusion: 强化学习主要提升语言模型在结构化知识中的程序性检索技能，而非损害记忆知识，这为理解RL对语言模型的影响提供了新视角。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is often credited with improving language model reasoning and generalization at the expense of degrading memorized knowledge. We challenge this narrative by observing that RL-enhanced models consistently outperform their base and supervised fine-tuned (SFT) counterparts on pure knowledge recall tasks, particularly those requiring traversal of hierarchical, structured knowledge (e.g., medical codes). We hypothesize these gains stem not from newly acquired data, but from improved procedural skills in navigating and searching existing knowledge hierarchies within the model parameters. To support this hypothesis, we show that structured prompting, which explicitly guides SFTed models through hierarchical traversal, recovers most of the performance gap (reducing 24pp to 7pp on MedConceptsQA for DeepSeek-V3/R1). We further find that while prompting improves final-answer accuracy, RL-enhanced models retain superior ability to recall correct procedural paths on deep-retrieval tasks. Finally our layer-wise internal activation analysis reveals that while factual representations (e.g., activations for the statement "code 57.95 refers to urinary infection") maintain high cosine similarity between SFT and RL models, query representations (e.g., "what is code 57.95") diverge noticeably, indicating that RL primarily transforms how models traverse knowledge rather than the knowledge representation itself.

The proposed recognition and learning algorithms improve the current state of the art in this field. The improvement is tested on two publicly available datasets, with significant improvements over literature-known F1 scores for the task, with optimal hyper-parameters determined, having code and models available for future use by the community.

TL;DR: 本文研究了强化学习与可验证奖励（RLVR）训练中LLM的熵动态，发现熵崩溃是性能提升的主要障碍，并提出了通过调整正负优势令牌的相对损失权重来有效调节模型熵的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR已成为增强LLM推理能力的主要方法，但训练过程中LLM的熵通常会崩溃，导致过早收敛到次优局部极小值并阻碍性能进一步改进。尽管已有多种方法缓解熵崩溃，但对RLVR中熵的全面研究仍然缺乏。

Method: 通过大量实验研究RLVR训练的LLM的熵动态，分析模型熵与响应多样性、校准和性能的关系，并理论证明和实证验证正优势令牌是熵崩溃的主要贡献者。

Result: 发现离策略更新次数、训练数据多样性和优化目标中的裁剪阈值是影响RLVR训练LLM熵的关键因素，证明通过调整正负优势令牌的相对损失权重可以有效调节模型熵。

Conclusion: 正优势令牌是熵崩溃的主要来源，通过适当调整正负优势令牌的相对损失权重可以有效控制模型熵，从而改善RLVR训练效果。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a predominant approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, the entropy of LLMs usually collapses during RLVR training, causing premature convergence to suboptimal local minima and hinder further performance improvement. Although various approaches have been proposed to mitigate entropy collapse, a comprehensive study of entropy in RLVR remains lacking. To address this gap, we conduct extensive experiments to investigate the entropy dynamics of LLMs trained with RLVR and analyze how model entropy correlates with response diversity, calibration, and performance across various benchmarks. Our findings reveal that the number of off-policy updates, the diversity of training data, and the clipping thresholds in the optimization objective are critical factors influencing the entropy of LLMs trained with RLVR. Moreover, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate that tokens with positive advantages are the primary contributors to entropy collapse, and that model entropy can be effectively regulated by adjusting the relative loss weights of tokens with positive and negative advantages during training.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床干预通常依赖于年龄因素，但语言模型在生物医学证据合成工作流程中是否能够保持这种关键的人口统计区分尚不确定。

Method: 构建DemogSummary数据集，包含儿童、成人和老年人群体，评估三种语言模型(Qwen、Longformer、GPT-4.1 Nano)的摘要生成能力，使用标准指标和新提出的Demographic Salience Score(DSS)来量化年龄相关实体的保留和幻觉。

Result: 模型在人口统计保真度方面存在系统性差异：成人相关摘要的人口统计保真度最低，弱势群体更容易出现幻觉。

Conclusion: 当前语言模型在忠实和无偏见的摘要生成方面存在局限性，需要在生物医学NLP中开发公平意识评估框架和摘要生成流程。

Abstract: Clinical interventions often hinge on age: medications and procedures safe for adults may be harmful to children or ineffective for older adults. However, as language models are increasingly integrated into biomedical evidence synthesis workflows, it remains uncertain whether these systems preserve such crucial demographic distinctions. To address this gap, we evaluate how well state-of-the-art language models retain age-related information when generating abstractive summaries of biomedical studies. We construct DemogSummary, a novel age-stratified dataset of systematic review primary studies, covering child, adult, and older adult populations. We evaluate three prominent summarisation-capable LLMs, Qwen (open-source), Longformer (open-source) and GPT-4.1 Nano (proprietary), using both standard metrics and a newly proposed Demographic Salience Score (DSS), which quantifies age-related entity retention and hallucination. Our results reveal systematic disparities across models and age groups: demographic fidelity is lowest for adult-focused summaries, and under-represented populations are more prone to hallucinations. These findings highlight the limitations of current LLMs in faithful and bias-free summarisation and point to the need for fairness-aware evaluation frameworks and summarisation pipelines in biomedical NLP.

TL;DR: 提出了一个多奖励组相对策略优化(GRPO)框架，用于微调大语言模型以实现伦理和无偏见行为，通过构建基于中文语境歧视类别的合成数据集，训练多维奖励模型来指导模型优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型常常表现出反映社会刻板印象的隐性偏见和歧视倾向，现有的对齐技术如RLHF和DPO在处理文化特定和多维形式的歧视方面存在局限性。

Method: 构建基于中文语境歧视类别的合成英文数据集，训练基于DeBERTa-v3的多维奖励模型，然后使用GRPO框架进行微调，优化公平性、中立性和语言质量。

Result: 实验结果显示偏见强度显著降低，模型输出与非歧视标准更加一致，同时保持了流畅性和信息性。

Conclusion: GRPO基于多奖励优化的方法在去偏见方面有效，为文化语境伦理对齐提供了可复现的框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit implicit biases and discriminatory tendencies that reflect underlying social stereotypes. While recent alignment techniques such as RLHF and DPO have mitigated some of these issues, they remain limited in addressing culturally specific and multi-dimensional forms of discrimination. This paper proposes a Multi-Reward Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework to fine-tune LLMs toward ethical and bias-free behavior. Our approach constructs a synthetic English-language dataset derived from Chinese-context discrimination categories, including regional, ethnic, and occupational biases. Each instance is paired with both neutral and biased responses to train a reward model based on DeBERTa-v3, which provides multi-dimensional reward signals capturing fairness, neutrality, and linguistic quality. The trained reward model then guides GRPO fine-tuning to optimize model outputs along these ethical dimensions. Experimental results demonstrate significant reductions in bias intensity and improved alignment with non-discriminatory standards without compromising fluency or informativeness. This study highlights the effectiveness of GRPO-based multi-reward optimization for de-biasing LLMs and offers a replicable framework for cultural-contextual ethical alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏自编码器(SAE)是解释大型语言模型(LLMs)的强大工具，但提取的特征数量庞大使得全面探索变得困难。传统嵌入技术如UMAP存在高维压缩伪影、过度绘制和误导性邻域扭曲等局限。

Method: 结合基于拓扑的可视化编码和降维技术，开发交互式可视化系统，忠实表示选定特征的局部和全局关系，支持用户通过目标化、可解释的子集来研究SAE行为。

Result: 该混合方法能够更深入地分析潜在空间中的概念表示，提供更细致入微的分析能力。

Conclusion: 提出的聚焦探索框架通过优先处理精选概念和相应SAE特征，结合拓扑可视化与降维技术，为分析大型语言模型中的概念表示提供了更有效的工具。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a powerful tool for uncovering interpretable features in large language models (LLMs) through the sparse directions they learn. However, the sheer number of extracted directions makes comprehensive exploration intractable. While conventional embedding techniques such as UMAP can reveal global structure, they suffer from limitations including high-dimensional compression artifacts, overplotting, and misleading neighborhood distortions. In this work, we propose a focused exploration framework that prioritizes curated concepts and their corresponding SAE features over attempts to visualize all available features simultaneously. We present an interactive visualization system that combines topology-based visual encoding with dimensionality reduction to faithfully represent both local and global relationships among selected features. This hybrid approach enables users to investigate SAE behavior through targeted, interpretable subsets, facilitating deeper and more nuanced analysis of concept representation in latent space.

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical challenge of developing computationally efficient hate speech detection systems that maintain competitive performance while being practical for real-time deployment. We propose a novel three-layer framework that combines rule-based pre-filtering with a parameter-efficient LoRA-tuned BERTweet model and continuous learning capabilities. Our approach achieves 0.85 macro F1 score - representing 94% of the performance of state-of-the-art large language models like SafePhi (Phi-4 based) while using a base model that is 100x smaller (134M vs 14B parameters). Compared to traditional BERT-based approaches with similar computational requirements, our method demonstrates superior performance through strategic dataset unification and optimized fine-tuning. The system requires only 1.87M trainable parameters (1.37% of full fine-tuning) and trains in approximately 2 hours on a single T4 GPU, making robust hate speech detection accessible in resource-constrained environments while maintaining competitive accuracy for real-world deployment.

Motivation: 现有多模态立场检测方法简单融合各模态信息来学习立场表示，忽视了不同模态在表达立场时的贡献差异，导致立场误解噪声被引入学习过程。

Method: 基于人类认知的双过程理论，提出ReMoD框架，包含经验驱动的直觉推理和深思熟虑的反思推理两个阶段。直觉阶段查询模态经验池和语义经验池形成初始立场假设，反思阶段通过模态思维链和语义思维链调整模态偏见、精炼立场判断，动态加权模态贡献。

Result: 在公开MMSD基准测试上的大量实验表明，ReMoD显著优于大多数基线模型，并展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: ReMoD通过双推理范式有效解决了多模态立场检测中模态贡献不平衡的问题，实现了更鲁棒和上下文感知的立场决策。

Abstract: Multimodal Stance Detection (MSD) is a crucial task for understanding public opinion on social media. Existing work simply fuses information from various modalities to learn stance representations, overlooking the varying contributions of stance expression from different modalities. Therefore, stance misunderstanding noises may be drawn into the stance learning process due to the risk of learning errors by rough modality combination. To address this, we get inspiration from the dual-process theory of human cognition and propose **ReMoD**, a framework that **Re**thinks **Mo**dality contribution of stance expression through a **D**ual-reasoning paradigm. ReMoD integrates *experience-driven intuitive reasoning* to capture initial stance cues with *deliberate reflective reasoning* to adjust for modality biases, refine stance judgments, and thereby dynamically weight modality contributions based on their actual expressive power for the target stance. Specifically, the intuitive stage queries the Modality Experience Pool (MEP) and Semantic Experience Pool (SEP) to form an initial stance hypothesis, prioritizing historically impactful modalities. This hypothesis is then refined in the reflective stage via two reasoning chains: Modality-CoT updates MEP with adaptive fusion strategies to amplify relevant modalities, while Semantic-CoT refines SEP with deeper contextual insights of stance semantics. These dual experience structures are continuously refined during training and recalled at inference to guide robust and context-aware stance decisions. Extensive experiments on the public MMSD benchmark demonstrate that our ReMoD significantly outperforms most baseline models and exhibits strong generalization capabilities.

To this end, we propose \textbf{ArchCraft}, a Framework that converts abstract architectural descriptions from academic papers into synthesizable Verilog projects with register-transfer level (RTL) verification. ArchCraft introduces a structured workflow, which uses formal graphs to capture the Architectural Blueprint and symbols to define the Functional Specification, translating unstructured academic papers into verifiable, hardware-aware designs. The framework then generates RTL and testbench (TB) code decoupled via these symbols to facilitate verification and debugging, ultimately reporting the circuit's Power, Area, and Performance (PPA). Moreover, we propose the first benchmark, \textbf{ArchSynthBench}, for synthesizing hardware from architectural descriptions, with a complete set of evaluation indicators, 50 project-level circuits, and around 600 circuit blocks. We systematically assess ArchCraft on ArchSynthBench, where the experiment results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, surpassing direct generation methods and the VerilogCoder framework in both paper understanding and code completion. Furthermore, evaluation and physical implementation of the generated executable RTL code show that these implementations meet all timing constraints without violations, and their performance metrics are consistent with those reported in the original papers.

### [246] [Stemming Hallucination in Language Models Using a Licensing Oracle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06073)
*Simeon Emanuilov,Richard Ackermann*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Licensing Oracle架构，通过结构化知识图谱的正式验证来约束语言模型的生成过程，确保只产生事实准确的声明，相比传统方法能完全消除幻觉


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型虽然具有强大的自然语言生成能力，但容易产生事实错误的幻觉信息，即使生成的文本在语法上是连贯的

Method: 在模型生成过程中嵌入确定性验证步骤，使用结构化知识图谱进行正式验证，确保只有事实准确的声明被生成

Result: Licensing Oracle实现了完美的弃权精度(AP=1.0)和零错误答案(FAR-NE=0.0)，事实回答准确率达到89.1%，而RAG和微调方法无法完全消除幻觉

Conclusion: Licensing Oracle为具有结构化知识表示的领域提供了必要且充分的幻觉解决方案，其框架为未来AI系统中的真理约束生成奠定了基础

Abstract: Language models exhibit remarkable natural language generation capabilities but remain prone to hallucinations, generating factually incorrect information despite producing syntactically coherent responses. This study introduces the Licensing Oracle, an architectural solution designed to stem hallucinations in LMs by enforcing truth constraints through formal validation against structured knowledge graphs. Unlike statistical approaches that rely on data scaling or fine-tuning, the Licensing Oracle embeds a deterministic validation step into the model's generative process, ensuring that only factually accurate claims are made. We evaluated the effectiveness of the Licensing Oracle through experiments comparing it with several state-of-the-art methods, including baseline language model generation, fine-tuning for factual recall, fine-tuning for abstention behavior, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Our results demonstrate that although RAG and fine-tuning improve performance, they fail to eliminate hallucinations. In contrast, the Licensing Oracle achieved perfect abstention precision (AP = 1.0) and zero false answers (FAR-NE = 0.0), ensuring that only valid claims were generated with 89.1% accuracy in factual responses. This work shows that architectural innovations, such as the Licensing Oracle, offer a necessary and sufficient solution for hallucinations in domains with structured knowledge representations, offering guarantees that statistical methods cannot match. Although the Licensing Oracle is specifically designed to address hallucinations in fact-based domains, its framework lays the groundwork for truth-constrained generation in future AI systems, providing a new path toward reliable, epistemically grounded models.

TL;DR: RAG方法在需要跨多文档检索和复杂推理的问题上表现不佳，本文通过结构化输出格式和答案验证优化RAG，显著超越长上下文方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RAG方法在处理需要跨多个文档检索信息或结合复杂推理的问题时存在局限，LOFT研究显示长上下文语言模型也有类似问题，QUEST基准测试表现尤其差。

Method: 优化RAG方法，结合包含推理和证据的结构化输出格式，可选地加入答案重新验证步骤。

Result: 通过优化后的RAG方法在QUEST-LOFT基准上显著超越长上下文方法的表现。

Conclusion: RAG方法可以通过结构化输出和答案验证进行优化，在处理复杂检索推理问题时能够超越长上下文语言模型。

Abstract: Despite the popularity of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) as a solution for grounded QA in both academia and industry, current RAG methods struggle with questions where the necessary information is distributed across many documents or where retrieval needs to be combined with complex reasoning. Recently, the LOFT study has shown that this limitation also applies to approaches based on long-context language models, with the QUEST benchmark exhibiting particularly large headroom. In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of the factors contributing to the poor performance on QUEST-LOFT, publish updated numbers based on a thorough human evaluation, and demonstrate that RAG can be optimized to significantly outperform long-context approaches when combined with a structured output format containing reasoning and evidence, optionally followed by answer re-verification.

TL;DR: 本文提出使用指称表达理解任务来评估视觉语言模型的空间推理能力，分析模型在对象检测模糊、复杂空间关系和否定表达等挑战下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在空间推理方面存在困难，现有分析工作主要使用图像描述和视觉问答任务，但缺乏对空间理解和基础能力的深入分析。

Method: 采用指称表达理解任务作为评估平台，分析任务特定架构和大型视觉语言模型在对象检测模糊、复杂空间关系和否定表达等情况下的表现。

Result: 所有模型在处理这些挑战时都面临困难，但相对表现取决于底层模型和空间语义类别（拓扑、方向、邻近等）。

Conclusion: 研究结果揭示了视觉语言模型在空间推理方面的挑战和行为模式，为未来研究方向提供了见解。

Abstract: Spatial Reasoning is an important component of human cognition and is an area in which the latest Vision-language models (VLMs) show signs of difficulty. The current analysis works use image captioning tasks and visual question answering. In this work, we propose using the Referring Expression Comprehension task instead as a platform for the evaluation of spatial reasoning by VLMs. This platform provides the opportunity for a deeper analysis of spatial comprehension and grounding abilities when there is 1) ambiguity in object detection, 2) complex spatial expressions with a longer sentence structure and multiple spatial relations, and 3) expressions with negation ('not'). In our analysis, we use task-specific architectures as well as large VLMs and highlight their strengths and weaknesses in dealing with these specific situations. While all these models face challenges with the task at hand, the relative behaviors depend on the underlying models and the specific categories of spatial semantics (topological, directional, proximal, etc.). Our results highlight these challenges and behaviors and provide insight into research gaps and future directions.

Motivation: 面向方面的摘要旨在生成突出文本特定方面的摘要，但应用于书籍时由于长文本参考摘要构建困难而未被探索。

Method: 提出BookAsSumQA评估框架，从叙事知识图谱自动生成面向特定方面的问答对，基于摘要的问答性能来评估摘要质量。

Result: 实验发现：LLM方法在短文本上准确率更高，但随着文档长度增加，RAG方法变得更有效，更适合面向方面的书籍摘要。

Conclusion: RAG方法在长文档的面向方面书籍摘要任务中比LLM方法更高效实用。

Abstract: Aspect-based summarization aims to generate summaries that highlight specific aspects of a text, enabling more personalized and targeted summaries. However, its application to books remains unexplored due to the difficulty of constructing reference summaries for long text. To address this challenge, we propose BookAsSumQA, a QA-based evaluation framework for aspect-based book summarization. BookAsSumQA automatically generates aspect-specific QA pairs from a narrative knowledge graph to evaluate summary quality based on its question-answering performance. Our experiments using BookAsSumQA revealed that while LLM-based approaches showed higher accuracy on shorter texts, RAG-based methods become more effective as document length increases, making them more efficient and practical for aspect-based book summarization.

TL;DR: STEER是一个无需外部模型的细粒度路由框架，通过小模型置信度分数在推理步骤级别进行路由，仅在必要时调用大模型，显著降低推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有路由方法需要训练外部路由模型，在领域迁移时缺乏鲁棒性，且需要昂贵的标签数据。STEER旨在提供领域无关的细粒度路由方案，避免外部模型依赖。

Method: 利用小模型在生成推理步骤前的置信度分数进行路由决策，当置信度不足时自动切换到更大模型，实现步骤级别的动态路由。

Result: 在数学推理、多跳问答和规划任务等多个领域基准测试中，STEER在保持或提升准确率的同时显著降低推理成本（相比仅用大模型，AIME任务上准确率提升20%，FLOPs减少48%）。

Conclusion: 模型内部置信度是鲁棒且领域无关的路由信号，为高效LLM部署提供了可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) - particularly model scaling and test-time techniques - have greatly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of language models at the expense of higher inference costs. To lower inference costs, prior works train router models or deferral mechanisms that allocate easy queries to a small, efficient model, while forwarding harder queries to larger, more expensive models. However, these trained router models often lack robustness under domain shifts and require expensive data synthesis techniques such as Monte Carlo rollouts to obtain sufficient ground-truth routing labels for training. In this work, we propose Confidence-Guided Stepwise Model Routing for Cost-Efficient Reasoning (STEER), a domain-agnostic framework that performs fine-grained, step-level routing between smaller and larger LLMs without utilizing external models. STEER leverages confidence scores from the smaller model's logits prior to generating a reasoning step, so that the large model is invoked only when necessary. Extensive evaluations using different LLMs on a diverse set of challenging benchmarks across multiple domains such as Mathematical Reasoning, Multi-Hop QA, and Planning tasks indicate that STEER achieves competitive or enhanced accuracy while reducing inference costs (up to +20% accuracy with 48% less FLOPs compared to solely using the larger model on AIME), outperforming baselines that rely on trained external modules. Our results establish model-internal confidence as a robust, domain-agnostic signal for model routing, offering a scalable pathway for efficient LLM deployment.

TL;DR: 提出EK-ICL框架，通过整合结构化显性知识来增强上下文学习在阿尔茨海默病检测中的推理稳定性和任务对齐，在数据稀缺和分布外条件下显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在阿尔茨海默病检测任务中，大语言模型在分布外和数据稀缺条件下表现不佳，现有上下文学习方法存在任务识别失败、演示选择次优、标签词与任务目标不对齐等问题。

Method: EK-ICL框架整合三种知识组件：基于小语言模型的置信度分数、解析特征分数以改进演示选择、标签词替换以解决语义不对齐，并采用基于解析的检索策略和集成预测。

Result: 在三个AD数据集上的实验表明，EK-ICL显著优于最先进的微调和上下文学习基线方法。

Conclusion: AD检测中的上下文学习性能对标签语义和任务特定上下文的对齐高度敏感，在低资源临床推理中显性知识至关重要。

Abstract: Detecting Alzheimer's Disease (AD) from narrative transcripts remains a challenging task for large language models (LLMs), particularly under out-of-distribution (OOD) and data-scarce conditions. While in-context learning (ICL) provides a parameter-efficient alternative to fine-tuning, existing ICL approaches often suffer from task recognition failure, suboptimal demonstration selection, and misalignment between label words and task objectives, issues that are amplified in clinical domains like AD detection. We propose Explicit Knowledge In-Context Learners (EK-ICL), a novel framework that integrates structured explicit knowledge to enhance reasoning stability and task alignment in ICL. EK-ICL incorporates three knowledge components: confidence scores derived from small language models (SLMs) to ground predictions in task-relevant patterns, parsing feature scores to capture structural differences and improve demo selection, and label word replacement to resolve semantic misalignment with LLM priors. In addition, EK-ICL employs a parsing-based retrieval strategy and ensemble prediction to mitigate the effects of semantic homogeneity in AD transcripts. Extensive experiments across three AD datasets demonstrate that EK-ICL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art fine-tuning and ICL baselines. Further analysis reveals that ICL performance in AD detection is highly sensitive to the alignment of label semantics and task-specific context, underscoring the importance of explicit knowledge in clinical reasoning under low-resource conditions.

TL;DR: 提出了优先级对齐（priority alignment）新范式，通过"可信优先于有用"的严格排序，在满足可信阈值的前提下优化有用性。引入自优先级对齐（SPA）无监督框架，通过生成多样化响应、自我评估和双重标准去噪来构建词典序偏好对，并使用不确定性加权对齐损失进行微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自残、法律或医疗等高风险场景中，LLMs需要同时具备可信性和有用性，但这两个目标常常相互冲突。需要一种能够确保可信性优先于有用性的对齐方法。

Method: SPA框架：1）生成多样化响应；2）模型自我评估和精炼；3）双重标准去噪去除不一致性和控制方差；4）构建词典序偏好对；5）使用不确定性加权对齐损失进行微调。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，SPA在保持安全性的同时提高了有用性，优于强基线方法，同时保持了通用能力。

Conclusion: SPA为关键LLM应用提供了一种可扩展且可解释的对齐策略，实现了可信性优先于有用性的严格排序。

Abstract: In high-stakes scenarios-such as self-harm, legal, or medical queries-LLMs must be both trustworthy and helpful. However, these goals often conflict. We propose priority alignment, a new alignment paradigm that enforces a strict "trustworthy-before-helpful" ordering: optimization of helpfulness is conditioned on first meeting trustworthy thresholds (e.g., harmlessness or honesty). To realize this, we introduce Self-Priority Alignment (SPA)-a fully unsupervised framework that generates diverse responses, self-evaluates them and refines them by the model itself, and applies dual-criterion denoising to remove inconsistency and control variance. From this, SPA constructs lexicographically ordered preference pairs and fine-tunes the model using an uncertainty-weighted alignment loss that emphasizes high-confidence, high-gap decisions. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that SPA improves helpfulness without compromising safety, outperforming strong baselines while preserving general capabilities. Our results demonstrate that SPA provides a scalable and interpretable alignment strategy for critical LLM applications.

Abstract: Discharge medication recommendation plays a critical role in ensuring treatment continuity, preventing readmission, and improving long-term management for patients with chronic metabolic diseases. This paper present an overview of the CHIP 2025 Shared Task 2 competition, which aimed to develop state-of-the-art approaches for automatically recommending appro-priate discharge medications using real-world Chinese EHR data. For this task, we constructed CDrugRed, a high-quality dataset consisting of 5,894 de-identified hospitalization records from 3,190 patients in China. This task is challenging due to multi-label nature of medication recommendation, het-erogeneous clinical text, and patient-specific variability in treatment plans. A total of 526 teams registered, with 167 and 95 teams submitting valid results to the Phase A and Phase B leaderboards, respectively. The top-performing team achieved the highest overall performance on the final test set, with a Jaccard score of 0.5102, F1 score of 0.6267, demonstrating the potential of advanced large language model (LLM)-based ensemble systems. These re-sults highlight both the promise and remaining challenges of applying LLMs to medication recommendation in Chinese EHRs. The post-evaluation phase remains open at https://tianchi.aliyun.com/competition/entrance/532411/.

TL;DR: ELECTRA-small模型在SNLI数据集上微调后，在处理否定句时表现不佳。通过添加强调否定的对比集和对抗样本进行数据增强，提高了模型对否定句的分类准确率，同时不影响整体性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练模型在自然语言推理任务中往往通过利用数据集伪相关而非真正理解语言结构（如否定）来获得高性能。本文旨在解决模型在处理否定句时的困难。

Method: 在SNLI数据集上微调ELECTRA-small模型，分析其处理否定句的问题，然后通过添加强调否定的对比集和对抗样本来增强训练数据。

Result: 目标数据增强显著提高了模型对包含否定句例子的分类准确率，同时没有对整体性能产生负面影响。

Conclusion: 针对性的数据增强可以有效缓解数据集伪相关问题，提高模型对否定等语言结构的理解能力。

Abstract: Pre-trained models for natural language inference (NLI) often achieve high performance on benchmark datasets by using spurious correlations, or dataset artifacts, rather than understanding language touches such as negation. In this project, we investigate the performance of an ELECTRA-small model fine-tuned on the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) dataset, focusing on its handling of negation. Through analysis, we identify that the model struggles with correctly classifying examples containing negation. To address this, we augment the training data with contrast sets and adversarial examples emphasizing negation. Our results demonstrate that this targeted data augmentation improves the model's accuracy on negation-containing examples without adversely affecting overall performance, therefore mitigating the identified dataset artifact.

Conclusion: TimeSense通过平衡文本推理和时间感知，使LLMs在时间序列分析中更加熟练，解决了文本偏见问题

Abstract: In the time-series domain, an increasing number of works combine text with temporal data to leverage the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for various downstream time-series understanding tasks. This enables a single model to flexibly perform tasks that previously required specialized models for each domain. However, these methods typically rely on text labels for supervision during training, biasing the model toward textual cues while potentially neglecting the full temporal features. Such a bias can lead to outputs that contradict the underlying time-series context. To address this issue, we construct the EvalTS benchmark, comprising 10 tasks across three difficulty levels, from fundamental temporal pattern recognition to complex real-world reasoning, to evaluate models under more challenging and realistic scenarios. We also propose TimeSense, a multimodal framework that makes LLMs proficient in time-series analysis by balancing textual reasoning with a preserved temporal sense. TimeSense incorporates a Temporal Sense module that reconstructs the input time-series within the model's context, ensuring that textual reasoning is grounded in the time-series dynamics. Moreover, to enhance spatial understanding of time-series data, we explicitly incorporate coordinate-based positional embeddings, which provide each time point with spatial context and enable the model to capture structural dependencies more effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that TimeSense achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks, and it particularly outperforms existing methods on complex multi-dimensional time-series reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出使用HatePrototypes（基于仇恨言论检测优化的语言模型生成的类别级向量表示）来实现显性和隐性仇恨言论之间的跨任务迁移，无需重复微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有仇恨言论检测基准主要关注针对受保护群体的显性仇恨，往往忽略隐性或间接仇恨（如贬低性比较、排斥或暴力呼吁、微妙歧视语言等），而隐性仇恨需要更深层次的语义处理。

Method: 使用HatePrototypes方法，从每个类别仅50个示例构建类别级向量表示，实现跨任务迁移和参数无关的早期退出机制。

Result: 研究表明这些原型能够在显性和隐性仇恨之间实现跨任务迁移，原型在不同基准间可互换，且参数无关的早期退出对两种仇恨类型都有效。

Conclusion: HatePrototypes方法支持高效且可迁移的仇恨言论检测，无需重复微调模型。

Abstract: Optimization of offensive content moderation models for different types of hateful messages is typically achieved through continued pre-training or fine-tuning on new hate speech benchmarks. However, existing benchmarks mainly address explicit hate toward protected groups and often overlook implicit or indirect hate, such as demeaning comparisons, calls for exclusion or violence, and subtle discriminatory language that still causes harm. While explicit hate can often be captured through surface features, implicit hate requires deeper, full-model semantic processing. In this work, we question the need for repeated fine-tuning and analyze the role of HatePrototypes, class-level vector representations derived from language models optimized for hate speech detection and safety moderation. We find that these prototypes, built from as few as 50 examples per class, enable cross-task transfer between explicit and implicit hate, with interchangeable prototypes across benchmarks. Moreover, we show that parameter-free early exiting with prototypes is effective for both hate types. We release the code, prototype resources, and evaluation scripts to support future research on efficient and transferable hate speech detection.

Abstract: Sugar dating-related content has rapidly proliferated on mainstream social media platforms, giving rise to serious societal and regulatory concerns, including commercialization of intimate relationships and the normalization of transactional relationships.~Detecting such content is highly challenging due to the prevalence of subtle euphemisms, ambiguous linguistic cues, and extreme class imbalance in real-world data.~In this work, we present SugarTextNet, a novel transformer-based framework specifically designed to identify sugar dating-related posts on social media.~SugarTextNet integrates a pretrained transformer encoder, an attention-based cue extractor, and a contextual phrase encoder to capture both salient and nuanced features in user-generated text.~To address class imbalance and enhance minority-class detection, we introduce Context-Aware Focal Loss, a tailored loss function that combines focal loss scaling with contextual weighting.~We evaluate SugarTextNet on a newly curated, manually annotated dataset of 3,067 Chinese social media posts from Sina Weibo, demonstrating that our approach substantially outperforms traditional machine learning models, deep learning baselines, and large language models across multiple metrics.~Comprehensive ablation studies confirm the indispensable role of each component.~Our findings highlight the importance of domain-specific, context-aware modeling for sensitive content detection, and provide a robust solution for content moderation in complex, real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 评估LLMs在药物开发和个性化医疗领域的实际应用能力，特别是对药物作用机制的事实知识和在新颖情境下的推理能力。

Method: 引入一个数据集，评估LLMs对已知药物机制的事实知识掌握，以及在训练中未见过的反事实情境下的推理能力。

Result: o4-mini模型表现优于OpenAI的其他模型，Qwen3-4B-thinking模型与o4-mini性能接近甚至在某些情况下更优。开放世界设置比封闭世界更具挑战性，内部链路的反事实推理比药物链路更难。

Conclusion: LLMs在药物机制推理方面仍有改进空间，特别是在开放世界设置和复杂反事实推理任务中。开源模型如Qwen3-4B-thinking展现出与商业模型竞争的潜力。

Abstract: Two scientific fields showing increasing interest in pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are drug development / repurposing, and personalized medicine. For both, LLMs have to demonstrate factual knowledge as well as a deep understanding of drug mechanisms, so they can recall and reason about relevant knowledge in novel situations. Drug mechanisms of action are described as a series of interactions between biomedical entities, which interlink into one or more chains directed from the drug to the targeted disease. Composing the effects of the interactions in a candidate chain leads to an inference about whether the drug might be useful or not for that disease. We introduce a dataset that evaluates LLMs on both factual knowledge of known mechanisms, and their ability to reason about them under novel situations, presented as counterfactuals that the models are unlikely to have seen during training. Using this dataset, we show that o4-mini outperforms the 4o, o3, and o3-mini models from OpenAI, and the recent small Qwen3-4B-thinking model closely matches o4-mini's performance, even outperforming it in some cases. We demonstrate that the open world setting for reasoning tasks, which requires the model to recall relevant knowledge, is more challenging than the closed world setting where the needed factual knowledge is provided. We also show that counterfactuals affecting internal links in the reasoning chain present a much harder task than those affecting a link from the drug mentioned in the prompt.

Abstract: Metaphors and metaphorical language (MLs) play an important role in healthcare communication between clinicians, patients, and patients' family members. In this work, we focus on Dutch language data from cancer patients. We extract metaphors used by patients using two data sources: (1) cancer patient storytelling interview data and (2) online forum data, including patients' posts, comments, and questions to professionals. We investigate how current state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) perform on this task by exploring different prompting strategies such as chain of thought reasoning, few-shot learning, and self-prompting. With a human-in-the-loop setup, we verify the extracted metaphors and compile the outputs into a corpus named HealthQuote.NL. We believe the extracted metaphors can support better patient care, for example shared decision making, improved communication between patients and clinicians, and enhanced patient health literacy. They can also inform the design of personalized care pathways. We share prompts and related resources at https://github.com/aaronlifenghan/HealthQuote.NL

### [261] [Towards Resource-Efficient Multimodal Intelligence: Learned Routing among Specialized Expert Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06441)
*Mayank Saini,Arit Kumar Bishwas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出统一模块化框架，通过智能路由将查询分配给最适合的专家模型，在保持性能的同时显著降低对昂贵模型的依赖


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型推理成本高阻碍实时部署，而开源小模型处理复杂或多模态查询能力不足，需要平衡成本与质量的解决方案

Method: 使用学习型路由网络智能分配查询到专家模型，视觉任务采用两阶段开源流水线，复活经典高效视觉组件

Result: 在MMLU和VQA等基准测试中匹配或超越始终使用昂贵模型的性能，同时减少对昂贵模型的依赖超过67%

Conclusion: 通过可扩展的多智能体编排，实现了高质量、资源高效的规模化AI部署

Abstract: As AI moves beyond text, large language models (LLMs) increasingly power vision, audio, and document understanding; however, their high inference costs hinder real-time, scalable deployment. Conversely, smaller open-source models offer cost advantages but struggle with complex or multimodal queries. We introduce a unified, modular framework that intelligently routes each query - textual, multimodal, or complex - to the most fitting expert model, using a learned routing network that balances cost and quality. For vision tasks, we employ a two-stage open-source pipeline optimized for efficiency and reviving efficient classical vision components where they remain SOTA for sub-tasks. On benchmarks such as Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) and Visual Question Answering (VQA), we match or exceed the performance of always-premium LLM (monolithic systems with one model serving all query types) performance, yet reduce the reliance on costly models by over 67%. With its extensible, multi-agent orchestration, we deliver high-quality, resource-efficient AI at scale.

*Bohan Yu,Wei Huang,Kang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SR-KI是一种将大规模结构化知识库集成到LLM中的新方法，通过编码知识库为键值对并注入KV缓存，实现端到端推理和动态知识更新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索增强生成方法依赖外部检索器和多阶段流程，性能受限于检索器质量，且难以支持实时知识更新。

Method: 使用预训练编码器将知识库编码为键值对，注入LLM的KV缓存；采用两阶段训练：定位检索层，并在该层应用基于注意力的损失函数监督相关知识条目。

Result: 在单张A100 40GB GPU上成功集成4万个知识库到7B LLM中，检索性能优异，最佳任务Recall@10超过98%，平均超过88%；知识库压缩率高达99.75%。

Conclusion: SR-KI实现了高效的知识库集成和压缩，支持端到端推理和动态更新，在保持强性能的同时显著提升了知识管理的效率。

Abstract: This paper proposes SR-KI, a novel approach for integrating real-time and large-scale structured knowledge bases (KBs) into large language models (LLMs). SR-KI begins by encoding KBs into key-value pairs using a pretrained encoder, and injects them into LLMs' KV cache. Building on this representation, we employ a two-stage training paradigm: first locating a dedicated retrieval layer within the LLM, and then applying an attention-based loss at this layer to explicitly supervise attention toward relevant KB entries. Unlike traditional retrieval-augmented generation methods that rely heavily on the performance of external retrievers and multi-stage pipelines, SR-KI supports end-to-end inference by performing retrieval entirely within the models latent space. This design enables efficient compression of injected knowledge and facilitates dynamic knowledge updates. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SR-KI enables the integration of up to 40K KBs into a 7B LLM on a single A100 40GB GPU, and achieves strong retrieval performance, maintaining over 98% Recall@10 on the best-performing task and exceeding 88% on average across all tasks. Task performance on question answering and KB ID generation also demonstrates that SR-KI maintains strong performance while achieving up to 99.75% compression of the injected KBs.

*Quang Phuoc Nguyen,David Anugraha,Felix Gaschi,Jun Bin Cheng,En-Shiun Annie Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过实证研究发现，词对齐策略在跨语言迁移中特别有利于低资源语言，且使用精心选择的语言子集可以达到甚至优于全语言对齐的效果，从而减少数据收集成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 词对齐是改善多语言模型跨语言迁移的有效策略，但现有方法效果不稳定，特别是在与英语类型差异大或低资源语言上。此外，词对齐工具通常依赖高质量平行数据，而这对许多低资源语言来说稀缺或噪声较大。

Method: 进行广泛的实证研究，比较使用所有可用语言与精心选择的语言子集进行词对齐的效果，特别关注对低资源语言的影响。

Result: 控制实验表明，词对齐对低资源语言特别有效，使用精心选择的语言多样性子集可以达到全多语言对齐的效果，甚至在对未见过的低资源语言上表现更优。

Conclusion: 有效的词对齐不需要穷尽所有语言覆盖，通过明智的语言选择可以减少数据收集开销，同时保持高效和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Realignment is a promising strategy to improve cross-lingual transfer in multilingual language models. However, empirical results are mixed and often unreliable, particularly for typologically distant or low-resource languages (LRLs) compared to English. Moreover, word realignment tools often rely on high-quality parallel data, which can be scarce or noisy for many LRLs. In this work, we conduct an extensive empirical study to investigate whether realignment truly benefits from using all available languages, or if strategically selected subsets can offer comparable or even improved cross-lingual transfer, and study the impact on LRLs. Our controlled experiments show that realignment can be particularly effective for LRLs and that using carefully selected, linguistically diverse subsets can match full multilingual alignment, and even outperform it for unseen LRLs. This indicates that effective realignment does not require exhaustive language coverage and can reduce data collection overhead, while remaining both efficient and robust when guided by informed language selection.

*Amit LeVi,Raz Lapid,Rom Himelstein,Yaniv Nemcovsky,Ravid Shwartz Ziv,Avi Mendelson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了两种任务感知的后训练量化方法TAQ和TAQO，通过分析隐藏表示中的任务相关信号来指导量化，在保持精度的同时显著降低模型大小和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在许多应用中只需要有限能力，但现有量化方法通常是任务无关的，忽略了任务特定信号在不同层的分布差异，导致效率低下。

Method: TAQ使用隐藏激活的任务条件统计来分配比特宽度，TAQO基于直接层敏感性测试分配精度。两种方法都识别任务相关层并保持其精度，同时积极量化其他层。

Result: 在多个模型上优于基线方法，TAQ在Phi-4上表现最佳，TAQO在Llama-3.1、Qwen3和Qwen2.5上领先。例如在Phi-4上达到42.33 EM/50.81 F1，远超AWQ方法。

Conclusion: 任务感知量化方法能够生成高效的任务专用模型，在显著降低平均精度的同时保持接近原始模型的准确率（<1.0%差距）。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel across diverse tasks, yet many applications require only limited capabilities, making large variants inefficient in memory and latency. Existing approaches often combine distillation and quantization, but most post-training quantization (PTQ) methods are task-agnostic, ignoring how task-specific signals are distributed across layers. In this work, we propose to use hidden representations that encode task-salient signals as a guideline for quantization. In order to fully utilize our innovative idea, this paper compares two new task-aware PTQ methods: Task-Aware Quantization (TAQ), which allocates bitwidths using task-conditioned statistics from hidden activations, and TAQO, which allocates precision based on direct layer sensitivity tests. From a small calibration set, these approaches identify task-relevant layers, preserving their precision while aggressively quantizing the rest. This yields stable task sensitivity profiles and efficient task-specialized models. Across models, TAQ and TAQO outperform the baselines; TAQ leads on Phi-4, while TAQO leads on Llama-3.1, Qwen3, and Qwen2.5. For instances, on Phi-4 it achieves 42.33 EM / 50.81 F1, far surpassing Activation-aware Weight Quantization (AWQ) (2.25 / 7.07), while remaining within < 1.0% of the original accuracy at lower average precision.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RefineLab是一个基于大语言模型的框架，能够在可控的token预算约束下自动将原始QA文本数据精炼成高质量数据集，解决了现有QA数据集在领域覆盖、难度分布和事实一致性方面的质量问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的QA数据集即使是专家制作的也存在领域覆盖不足、难度分布不匹配和事实不一致等质量问题，而生成模型驱动的数据集进一步加剧了这些质量问题。

Method: RefineLab将目标质量属性作为优化目标，在预定义的token预算内执行选择性编辑。它通过分配模块选择最优的精炼策略，在预算约束下最大化整体数据集质量。

Result: 实验表明，RefineLab在覆盖范围、难度对齐、事实保真度和干扰项质量方面持续缩小与专家数据集的差距。

Conclusion: RefineLab为可复现的数据集设计开创了一条可扩展、可定制的路径，对LLM评估具有广泛意义。

Abstract: High-quality Question-Answer (QA) datasets are foundational for reliable Large Language Model (LLM) evaluation, yet even expert-crafted datasets exhibit persistent gaps in domain coverage, misaligned difficulty distributions, and factual inconsistencies. The recent surge in generative model-powered datasets has compounded these quality challenges. In this work, we introduce RefineLab, the first LLM-driven framework that automatically refines raw QA textual data into high-quality datasets under a controllable token-budget constraint. RefineLab takes a set of target quality attributes (such as coverage and difficulty balance) as refinement objectives, and performs selective edits within a predefined token budget to ensure practicality and efficiency. In essence, RefineLab addresses a constrained optimization problem: improving the quality of QA samples as much as possible while respecting resource limitations. With a set of available refinement operations (e.g., rephrasing, distractor replacement), RefineLab takes as input the original dataset, a specified set of target quality dimensions, and a token budget, and determines which refinement operations should be applied to each QA sample. This process is guided by an assignment module that selects optimal refinement strategies to maximize overall dataset quality while adhering to the budget constraint. Experiments demonstrate that RefineLab consistently narrows divergence from expert datasets across coverage, difficulty alignment, factual fidelity, and distractor quality. RefineLab pioneers a scalable, customizable path to reproducible dataset design, with broad implications for LLM evaluation.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了ibom数据集，这是一个用于机器翻译和主题分类的数据集，包含尼日利亚阿夸伊博姆州的四种沿海语言：Anaang、Efik、Ibibio和Oro。这些语言目前在Google Translate和主要基准测试中都没有代表。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尼日利亚拥有200多种语言，但NLP研究主要集中在Hausa、Igbo、尼日利亚皮钦语和约鲁巴语这四种语言上（不到尼日利亚语言的1%）。这是由于缺乏这些语言的文本数据来训练和应用NLP算法。

Method: 扩展Flores-200基准测试到这些语言，并将翻译文本与基于SIB-200分类数据集的主题标签对齐。

Result: 评估显示当前LLM在零样本和少样本设置下对这些语言的机器翻译表现不佳。但发现少样本样本能稳步提高主题分类性能。

Conclusion: 需要更多工作来支持尼日利亚的语言多样性，ibom数据集为研究这些代表性不足的语言提供了资源。

Abstract: Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa with a population of more than 200 million people. More than 500 languages are spoken in Nigeria and it is one of the most linguistically diverse countries in the world. Despite this, natural language processing (NLP) research has mostly focused on the following four languages: Hausa, Igbo, Nigerian-Pidgin, and Yoruba (i.e <1% of the languages spoken in Nigeria). This is in part due to the unavailability of textual data in these languages to train and apply NLP algorithms. In this work, we introduce ibom -- a dataset for machine translation and topic classification in four Coastal Nigerian languages from the Akwa Ibom State region: Anaang, Efik, Ibibio, and Oro. These languages are not represented in Google Translate or in major benchmarks such as Flores-200 or SIB-200. We focus on extending Flores-200 benchmark to these languages, and further align the translated texts with topic labels based on SIB-200 classification dataset. Our evaluation shows that current LLMs perform poorly on machine translation for these languages in both zero-and-few shot settings. However, we find the few-shot samples to steadily improve topic classification with more shots.

TL;DR: Rep2Text框架能够从LLM的最后一个token表示中恢复原始输入文本，平均能恢复16个token序列中超过一半的信息，同时保持语义完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在各种任务上取得了显著进展，但其内部机制仍然不透明。本研究旨在探索从LLM的单个最后token表示中恢复原始输入文本的程度。

Method: 提出Rep2Text框架，使用可训练的适配器将目标模型的内部表示投影到解码语言模型的嵌入空间，然后自回归地重建输入文本。

Result: 在多种模型组合上的实验表明，平均能恢复16个token序列中超过一半的信息，同时保持强大的语义完整性和连贯性。还发现了信息瓶颈效应：较长序列的token级恢复率下降但语义完整性保持良好。

Conclusion: Rep2Text框架能够有效从压缩表示中恢复文本信息，并在医学数据等分布外数据上表现出强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across diverse tasks, yet their internal mechanisms remain largely opaque. In this work, we address a fundamental question: to what extent can the original input text be recovered from a single last-token representation within an LLM? We propose Rep2Text, a novel framework for decoding full text from last-token representations. Rep2Text employs a trainable adapter that projects a target model's internal representations into the embedding space of a decoding language model, which then autoregressively reconstructs the input text. Experiments on various model combinations (Llama-3.1-8B, Gemma-7B, Mistral-7B-v0.1, Llama-3.2-3B) demonstrate that, on average, over half of the information in 16-token sequences can be recovered from this compressed representation while maintaining strong semantic integrity and coherence. Furthermore, our analysis reveals an information bottleneck effect: longer sequences exhibit decreased token-level recovery while preserving strong semantic integrity. Besides, our framework also demonstrates robust generalization to out-of-distribution medical data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于解析的RAG方法在处理表格数据时性能不佳，而直接微调嵌入模型又需要高昂的计算硬件成本。

Method: TabRAG使用结构化语言表示来处理表格密集型文档，构建解析式的RAG管道。

Result: TabRAG在生成和检索任务上优于现有的流行解析方法。

Conclusion: TabRAG为处理表格密集型文档提供了一种有效的解析式RAG解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Ingesting data for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) involves either fine-tuning the embedding model directly on the target corpus or parsing documents for embedding model encoding. The former, while accurate, incurs high computational hardware requirements, while the latter suffers from suboptimal performance when extracting tabular data. In this work, we address the latter by presenting TabRAG, a parsing-based RAG pipeline designed to tackle table-heavy documents via structured language representations. TabRAG outperforms existing popular parsing-based methods for generation and retrieval. Code is available at https://github.com/jacobyhsi/TabRAG.

TL;DR: 音频大语言模型在临床决策中存在严重的模态偏见，基于患者声音特征而非医学证据做出判断，可能导致医疗不平等


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型从文本界面转向音频交互，可能通过音频中的副语言线索引入新的脆弱性，特别是在临床环境中

Method: 评估了170个临床案例，每个案例合成为36种不同声音配置的语音，涵盖年龄、性别和情感变化，并与相同文本输入进行比较

Result: 发现严重模态偏见：音频输入的手术建议与相同文本输入相比变化高达35%，一个模型提供80%更少的建议；年龄差异高达12%；链式思维提示无法消除年龄偏见；情感影响未被检测到

Conclusion: 音频大语言模型容易基于患者声音特征而非医学证据做出临床决策，这种缺陷可能加剧医疗不平等，需要在临床部署前紧急开发偏见感知架构

Abstract: As large language models transition from text-based interfaces to audio interactions in clinical settings, they might introduce new vulnerabilities through paralinguistic cues in audio. We evaluated these models on 170 clinical cases, each synthesized into speech from 36 distinct voice profiles spanning variations in age, gender, and emotion. Our findings reveal a severe modality bias: surgical recommendations for audio inputs varied by as much as 35% compared to identical text-based inputs, with one model providing 80% fewer recommendations. Further analysis uncovered age disparities of up to 12% between young and elderly voices, which persisted in most models despite chain-of-thought prompting. While explicit reasoning successfully eliminated gender bias, the impact of emotion was not detected due to poor recognition performance. These results demonstrate that audio LLMs are susceptible to making clinical decisions based on a patient's voice characteristics rather than medical evidence, a flaw that risks perpetuating healthcare disparities. We conclude that bias-aware architectures are essential and urgently needed before the clinical deployment of these models.

Motivation: 建立语言学研究和计算建模之间的概念桥梁，使修辞模式在各领域间相互受益，增强多个应用中的认知多样性。

Method: 提出对偶性模式操作（分裂-联合、前进-后退、扩展-缩减和正交对偶性）来扩展修辞模式集合，并引入金字塔多层映射框架（从修辞模型层到认知层再到认知层）来降低认知复杂度。

Result: 通过二项组合学和香农熵分析量化了表达多样性和复杂度降低的程度，识别了边际修辞比特（MRB），定义了衡量表达增长速度的修辞可扩展参数。分层选择相比平面选择显著降低了选择不确定性。

Conclusion: 这项工作将静态不可测量的修辞分类转化为更动态可测量的语篇设计系统，为未来AI系统在分层修辞推理结构上操作提供了可能路径。

Abstract: Rhetorical modes are useful in both academic and non-academic writing, and can be subjects to be studied within linguistic research and computational modeling. Establishing a conceptual bridge among these domains could enable each to benefit from the others. This paper proposes duality-based mode operations (split-unite, forward-backward, expansion-reduction and orthogonal dualities) to expand the set of rhetorical modes, introducing generated modes like combination and generalization, thereby enhancing epistemic diversity across multiple applications. It further presents a pyramid multilayer mapping framework (e.g., three layers from the rhetorical model layer, to cognitive layer, and to epistemic layers) that reduces the resulting cognitive complexity. The degrees of expressive diversity and complexity reduction are quantified through binomial combinatorics and Shannon entropy analysis. A Marginal Rhetorical Bit (MRB) is identified, permitting the definition of a rhetorical-scalable parameter that measures expressive growth speed in bits per stage. A direct entropy measure shows that hierarchical selection over smaller subsets markedly reduces choice uncertainty compared with flat selection across all modes. These considerations appear to transform static and non-measurable rhetorical taxonomies into more dynamic and more measurable systems for discourse design. From this work, it would be possible to identify a pathway for future AI systems to operate not only on language tokens but on layered rhetorical reasoning structures, bridging linguistic, pedagogical, academic, and computational research

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI驱动的审核在日常生活中普及，人们经常开玩笑说'AI有偏见'，但这反映了对算法偏见的深层担忧。作者希望验证在线帖子被标记为'不当内容'是否真的是算法偏见的结果。

Method: 采用双管齐下的方法：1) 对广泛使用的毒性模型(unitary/toxic-bert)进行定量基准测试，比较非裔美国英语和标准美国英语的性能差异；2) 开发交互式教学工具，通过用户控制的'敏感度阈值'机制使抽象偏见具体化。

Result: 基准测试显示明显系统性偏见：平均而言，模型对非裔美国英语文本的毒性评分是标准美国英语的1.8倍，'身份仇恨'评分高出8.8倍。交互工具展示了偏见分数本身不是唯一危害，更令人担忧的是人类设定的看似中立政策最终操作化为歧视。

Conclusion: 这项工作既提供了差异影响的统计证据，又开发了面向公众的工具，旨在培养批判性AI素养，揭示AI偏见如何通过技术系统转化为实际歧视。

Abstract: Now that AI-driven moderation has become pervasive in everyday life, we often hear claims that "the AI is biased". While this is often said jokingly, the light-hearted remark reflects a deeper concern. How can we be certain that an online post flagged as "inappropriate" was not simply the victim of a biased algorithm? This paper investigates this problem using a dual approach. First, I conduct a quantitative benchmark of a widely used toxicity model (unitary/toxic-bert) to measure performance disparity between text in African-American English (AAE) and Standard American English (SAE). The benchmark reveals a clear, systematic bias: on average, the model scores AAE text as 1.8 times more toxic and 8.8 times higher for "identity hate". Second, I introduce an interactive pedagogical tool that makes these abstract biases tangible. The tool's core mechanic, a user-controlled "sensitivity threshold," demonstrates that the biased score itself is not the only harm; instead, the more-concerning harm is the human-set, seemingly neutral policy that ultimately operationalises discrimination. This work provides both statistical evidence of disparate impact and a public-facing tool designed to foster critical AI literacy.

Motivation: 标准语到方言的机器翻译面临两大挑战：大语言模型中存在的方言差距，以及n-gram指标中固有的评估失真问题（倾向于源文本复制而非真实方言翻译）。

Method: DIA-REFINE框架包含翻译、验证和反馈的迭代循环，使用外部方言分类器来指导LLM。提出了方言保真度评分和目方言比例两个新指标来量化语言转换和方言翻译成功度。

Result: 在韩语方言上的实验表明，DIA-REFINE能持续提升方言保真度。新指标能区分伪成功案例和真实尝试案例，并发现模型对框架的响应程度不同，结合上下文示例能进一步改善方言表达翻译。

Conclusion: 该研究为面向目标的包容性方言翻译建立了稳健框架，提供了严格的评估方法和对模型性能的关键见解。

Abstract: Standard-to-dialect machine translation remains challenging due to a persistent dialect gap in large language models and evaluation distortions inherent in n-gram metrics, which favor source copying over authentic dialect translation. In this paper, we propose the dialect refinement (DIA-REFINE) framework, which guides LLMs toward faithful target dialect outputs through an iterative loop of translation, verification, and feedback using external dialect classifiers. To address the limitations of n-gram-based metrics, we introduce the dialect fidelity score (DFS) to quantify linguistic shift and the target dialect ratio (TDR) to measure the success of dialect translation. Experiments on Korean dialects across zero-shot and in-context learning baselines demonstrate that DIA-REFINE consistently enhances dialect fidelity. The proposed metrics distinguish between False Success cases, where high n-gram scores obscure failures in dialectal translation, and True Attempt cases, where genuine attempts at dialectal translation yield low n-gram scores. We also observed that models exhibit varying degrees of responsiveness to the framework, and that integrating in-context examples further improves the translation of dialectal expressions. Our work establishes a robust framework for goal-directed, inclusive dialect translation, providing both rigorous evaluation and critical insights into model performance.

Conclusion: TSAN提供了一种可解释的、无需参数更新的测试时偏好优化范式，能有效利用多个候选解决方案提升模型输出质量

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization capabilities, but aligning their outputs with human preferences typically requires expensive supervised fine-tuning. Recent test-time methods leverage textual feedback to overcome this, but they often critique and revise a single candidate response, lacking a principled mechanism to systematically analyze, weigh, and synthesize the strengths of multiple promising candidates. Such a mechanism is crucial because different responses may excel in distinct aspects (e.g., clarity, factual accuracy, or tone), and combining their best elements may produce a far superior outcome. This paper proposes the Textual Self-Attention Network (TSAN), a new paradigm for test-time preference optimization that requires no parameter updates. TSAN emulates self-attention entirely in natural language to overcome this gap: it analyzes multiple candidates by formatting them into textual keys and values, weighs their relevance using an LLM-based attention module, and synthesizes their strengths into a new, preference-aligned response under the guidance of the learned textual attention. This entire process operates in a textual gradient space, enabling iterative and interpretable optimization. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that with just three test-time iterations on a base SFT model, TSAN outperforms supervised models like Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct and surpasses the current state-of-the-art test-time alignment method by effectively leveraging multiple candidate solutions.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of the gaming industry, driven by technological advancements and a burgeoning community, necessitates a deeper understanding of user sentiments, especially as expressed on popular social media platforms like YouTube. This study presents a sentiment analysis on video games based on YouTube comments, aiming to understand user sentiments within the gaming community. Utilizing YouTube API, comments related to various video games were collected and analyzed using the TextBlob sentiment analysis tool. The pre-processed data underwent classification using machine learning algorithms, including Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Among these, SVM demonstrated superior performance, achieving the highest classification accuracy across different datasets. The analysis spanned multiple popular gaming videos, revealing trends and insights into user preferences and critiques. The findings underscore the importance of advanced sentiment analysis in capturing the nuanced emotions expressed in user comments, providing valuable feedback for game developers to enhance game design and user experience. Future research will focus on integrating more sophisticated natural language processing techniques and exploring additional data sources to further refine sentiment analysis in the gaming domain.

TL;DR: 对医学领域RAG系统的全面专家评估显示，标准RAG反而会降低性能，只有22%的检索段落相关，证据选择精度仅41-43%，事实性和完整性下降达6%和5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在医学领域面临的两个核心挑战：跟上快速发展的医学知识，以及提供可验证的证据推理。

Method: 18位医学专家对800个模型输出进行80,502次标注，系统分解RAG流程为三个组件：证据检索、证据选择和响应生成。

Result: 标准RAG表现不佳，但通过证据过滤和查询重构等简单策略，在MedMCQA和MedXpertQA上的性能可提升达12%和8.2%。

Conclusion: 需要重新审视RAG在医学中的作用，强调阶段感知评估和精心系统设计对可靠医学LLM应用的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are transforming the landscape of medicine, yet two fundamental challenges persist: keeping up with rapidly evolving medical knowledge and providing verifiable, evidence-grounded reasoning. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been widely adopted to address these limitations by supplementing model outputs with retrieved evidence. However, whether RAG reliably achieves these goals remains unclear. Here, we present the most comprehensive expert evaluation of RAG in medicine to date. Eighteen medical experts contributed a total of 80,502 annotations, assessing 800 model outputs generated by GPT-4o and Llama-3.1-8B across 200 real-world patient and USMLE-style queries. We systematically decomposed the RAG pipeline into three components: (i) evidence retrieval (relevance of retrieved passages), (ii) evidence selection (accuracy of evidence usage), and (iii) response generation (factuality and completeness of outputs). Contrary to expectation, standard RAG often degraded performance: only 22% of top-16 passages were relevant, evidence selection remained weak (precision 41-43%, recall 27-49%), and factuality and completeness dropped by up to 6% and 5%, respectively, compared with non-RAG variants. Retrieval and evidence selection remain key failure points for the model, contributing to the overall performance drop. We further show that simple yet effective strategies, including evidence filtering and query reformulation, substantially mitigate these issues, improving performance on MedMCQA and MedXpertQA by up to 12% and 8.2%, respectively. These findings call for re-examining RAG's role in medicine and highlight the importance of stage-aware evaluation and deliberate system design for reliable medical LLM applications.

*Nicy Scaria,Silvester John Joseph Kennedy,Deepak Subramani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了23个小语言模型（270M-4B参数）在指令微调过程中对数据污染的鲁棒性，发现句法污染（如字符反转）会导致灾难性性能下降，而语义污染表现出阈值行为和更强的恢复力。研究还发现更大模型更容易学习语义污染，存在"能力诅咒"现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小语言模型在资源受限环境中部署日益增多，但其在指令微调过程中对数据污染的行为鲁棒性仍不清楚。需要系统评估SLMs对不同类型的污染（句法和语义）的敏感性。

Method: 对23个SLMs（270M-4B参数）进行系统研究，测量其在指令微调中对句法变换（字符和单词反转）和语义变换（无关和反事实响应）的敏感性，污染水平分别为25%、50%、75%和100%。

Result: 发现脆弱性模式存在根本性不对称：句法变换导致灾难性性能下降，字符反转在所有模型中产生近乎完全失败；语义变换显示阈值行为和更强的语言能力恢复力。更大、更有能力的模型更容易学习语义污染，存在"能力诅咒"。对齐提供的鲁棒性收益不一致，有时甚至降低恢复力。

Conclusion: 研究确立了三个核心贡献：SLMs对句法模式污染的不成比例脆弱性的实证证据、句法和语义变换间不对称敏感性模式的识别、以及污染鲁棒性评估的系统协议。这些发现对当前部署有直接影响，表明现有鲁棒性假设可能不适用于较小模型，并强调需要污染感知的训练协议。

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) are increasingly being deployed in resource-constrained environments, yet their behavioral robustness to data contamination during instruction tuning remains poorly understood. We systematically investigate the contamination sensitivity of 23 SLMs (270M to 4B parameters) across multiple model families by measuring susceptibility to syntactic and semantic transformation types during instruction tuning: syntactic transformations (character and word reversal) and semantic transformations (irrelevant and counterfactual responses), each applied at contamination levels of 25\%, 50\%, 75\%, and 100\%. Our results reveal fundamental asymmetries in vulnerability patterns: syntactic transformations cause catastrophic performance degradation, with character reversal producing near-complete failure across all models regardless of size or family, while semantic transformations demonstrate distinct threshold behaviors and greater resilience in core linguistic capabilities. Critically, we discover a ``\textit{capability curse}" where larger, more capable models become more susceptible to learning semantic corruptions, effectively following harmful instructions more readily, while our analysis of base versus instruction-tuned variants reveals that alignment provides inconsistent robustness benefits, sometimes even reducing resilience. Our work establishes three core contributions: (1) empirical evidence of SLMs' disproportionate vulnerability to syntactic pattern contamination, (2) identification of asymmetric sensitivity patterns between syntactic and semantic transformations, and (3) systematic evaluation protocols for contamination robustness assessment. These findings have immediate deployment implications, suggesting that current robustness assumptions may not hold for smaller models and highlighting the need for contamination-aware training protocols.

TL;DR: SafeNlidb是一个针对LLM数据库自然语言接口的隐私安全对齐框架，通过自动生成混合思维链数据和交替偏好优化，在保持高实用性的同时显著提升安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在数据库自然语言接口应用中存在隐私泄露风险，可能无意中暴露机密数据或被攻击者操纵。现有方法难以应对复杂推理攻击，误报率高且影响SQL查询可靠性。

Method: 提出SafeNlidb框架，包含自动生成混合思维链交互数据的流程，结合隐式安全推理与SQL生成；引入推理预热和交替偏好优化来克服DPO的多偏好振荡问题。

Result: 实验表明该方法优于更大规模的LLM和理想设置基线，在保持高实用性的同时实现了显著的安全改进。

Conclusion: SafeNlidb框架能够在不依赖人工标注偏好数据的情况下，通过细粒度推理生成安全感知的SQL，有效解决LLM数据库接口的隐私安全问题。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven significant progress in Natural Language Interface to Database (NLIDB). However, the widespread adoption of LLMs has raised critical privacy and security concerns. During interactions, LLMs may unintentionally expose confidential database contents or be manipulated by attackers to exfiltrate data through seemingly benign queries. While current efforts typically rely on rule-based heuristics or LLM agents to mitigate this leakage risk, these methods still struggle with complex inference-based attacks, suffer from high false positive rates, and often compromise the reliability of SQL queries. To address these challenges, we propose \textsc{SafeNlidb}, a novel privacy-security alignment framework for LLM-based NLIDB. The framework features an automated pipeline that generates hybrid chain-of-thought interaction data from scratch, seamlessly combining implicit security reasoning with SQL generation. Additionally, we introduce reasoning warm-up and alternating preference optimization to overcome the multi-preference oscillations of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), enabling LLMs to produce security-aware SQL through fine-grained reasoning without the need for human-annotated preference data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms both larger-scale LLMs and ideal-setting baselines, achieving significant security improvements while preserving high utility.WARNING: This work may contain content that is offensive and harmful!

TL;DR: Focal Attention通过控制softmax温度来锐化注意力分布，使模型能更专注于相关token，在模型规模、训练数据和上下文长度方面比标准transformer表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准softmax注意力在长上下文场景中会产生噪声概率分布，影响各层特征选择的有效性。

Method: 提出Focal Attention，通过固定或可学习的超参数控制softmax温度来锐化注意力分布。

Result: 在相同精度下可减少42%参数或33%训练数据，在长上下文任务中相对改进17%-82%。

Conclusion: Focal Attention是简单有效的注意力机制改进，在多种应用场景中表现优异。

Abstract: Attention is a core component of transformer architecture, whether encoder-only, decoder-only, or encoder-decoder model. However, the standard softmax attention often produces noisy probability distribution, which can impair effective feature selection at every layer of these models, particularly for long contexts. We propose Focal Attention, a simple yet effective modification that sharpens the attention distribution by controlling the softmax temperature, either as a fixed hyperparameter or as a learnable parameter during training. This sharpening enables the model to concentrate on the most relevant tokens while suppressing irrelevant ones. Empirically, Focal Attention scales more favorably than standard transformer with respect to model size, training data, and context length. Across diverse benchmarks, it achieves the same accuracy with up to 42% fewer parameters or 33% less training data. On long-context tasks, it delivers substantial relative improvements ranging from 17% to 82%, demonstrating its effectiveness in real world applications.

TL;DR: DA4ICL框架通过多样化对比检索和投影向量锚定，解决了LLMs在阿尔茨海默病检测中上下文感知不足的问题，显著提升了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ICL在阿尔茨海默病检测任务中表现不佳，因为演示集缺乏多样性和细粒度信号，而任务向量方法在注入粒度和强度上不匹配。

Method: 提出DA4ICL框架，包含多样化对比检索扩展上下文宽度，以及投影向量锚定在每个Transformer层深化信号。

Result: 在三个AD基准测试中，DA4ICL相比ICL和TV基线实现了大幅稳定的性能提升。

Conclusion: DA4ICL为细粒度、分布外和低资源LLM适应开辟了新范式。

Abstract: Detecting Alzheimer's disease (AD) from narrative transcripts challenges large language models (LLMs): pre-training rarely covers this out-of-distribution task, and all transcript demos describe the same scene, producing highly homogeneous contexts. These factors cripple both the model's built-in task knowledge (\textbf{task cognition}) and its ability to surface subtle, class-discriminative cues (\textbf{contextual perception}). Because cognition is fixed after pre-training, improving in-context learning (ICL) for AD detection hinges on enriching perception through better demonstration (demo) sets. We demonstrate that standard ICL quickly saturates, its demos lack diversity (context width) and fail to convey fine-grained signals (context depth), and that recent task vector (TV) approaches improve broad task adaptation by injecting TV into the LLMs' hidden states (HSs), they are ill-suited for AD detection due to the mismatch of injection granularity, strength and position. To address these bottlenecks, we introduce \textbf{DA4ICL}, a demo-centric anchoring framework that jointly expands context width via \emph{\textbf{Diverse and Contrastive Retrieval}} (DCR) and deepens each demo's signal via \emph{\textbf{Projected Vector Anchoring}} (PVA) at every Transformer layer. Across three AD benchmarks, DA4ICL achieves large, stable gains over both ICL and TV baselines, charting a new paradigm for fine-grained, OOD and low-resource LLM adaptation.

TL;DR: CLiFT-ASR是一个用于低资源语言（如台湾闽南语）自动语音识别的跨语言微调框架，通过两阶段渐进式适应方法，在TAT-MOE语料库上实现了24.88%的相对字符错误率降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言如台湾闽南语的自动语音识别问题，因为标注数据稀缺，且现有方法在汉字转录和罗马化标注之间难以平衡语音细节和词汇句法覆盖。

Method: 基于普通话HuBERT模型的两阶段跨语言微调框架：第一阶段从拼音Tai-lo标注学习声学和音调表示，第二阶段从汉字转录捕获词汇和句法信息。

Result: 在TAT-MOE语料库上的实验表明，相比强基线方法，CLiFT-ASR实现了24.88%的相对字符错误率降低。

Conclusion: CLiFT-ASR为台湾闽南语ASR提供了有效且参数高效的解决方案，并具有扩展到其他低资源语言场景的潜力。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) for low-resource languages such as Taiwanese Hokkien is difficult due to the scarcity of annotated data. However, direct fine-tuning on Han-character transcriptions often fails to capture detailed phonetic and tonal cues, while training only on romanization lacks lexical and syntactic coverage. In addition, prior studies have rarely explored staged strategies that integrate both annotation types. To address this gap, we present CLiFT-ASR, a cross-lingual fine-tuning framework that builds on Mandarin HuBERT models and progressively adapts them to Taiwanese Hokkien. The framework employs a two-stage process in which it first learns acoustic and tonal representations from phonetic Tai-lo annotations and then captures vocabulary and syntax from Han-character transcriptions. This progressive adaptation enables effective alignment between speech sounds and orthographic structures. Experiments on the TAT-MOE corpus demonstrate that CLiFT-ASR achieves a 24.88\% relative reduction in character error rate (CER) compared with strong baselines. The results indicate that CLiFT-ASR provides an effective and parameter-efficient solution for Taiwanese Hokkien ASR and that it has potential to benefit other low-resource language scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了实体角色检测问题，将其建模为命名实体识别和实体检索/排序任务，探索了在不同上下文（句子和文档）中学习角色和实体表示的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言处理系统通常进行基于实体的处理，但当实体在特定上下文中根据其行为或属性扮演角色时，需要解决实体角色检测问题。现实世界中的实体通常分为人物、地点、组织等类型，而角色可视为这些类型的领域相关子类型。

Method: 将实体角色检测问题建模为两种方法：1) 命名实体识别方法，将角色视为互斥类别，使用序列标注等标准NER方法；2) 实体检索方法，将角色制定为查询，实体作为需要执行查询的集合。开发了自动学习代表性词和短语的方法，构建角色和实体的表示。

Result: 论文探索了在不同上下文（句子和文档）中学习角色和实体表示的方法，并尝试以领域无关的方式利用小数据集中的信息，因为角色依赖于上下文，通常难以获得大型领域特定数据集或知识库。

Conclusion: 实体角色检测可以通过命名实体识别和实体检索两种方法来解决，特别是在缺乏大型领域特定数据集的情况下，可以开发领域无关的方法来有效利用有限的数据资源。

Abstract: Most of the Natural Language Processing sys- tems are involved in entity-based processing for several tasks like Information Extraction, Question-Answering, Text-Summarization and so on. A new challenge comes when entities play roles according to their act or attributes in certain context. Entity Role Detection is the task of assigning such roles to the entities. Usu- ally real-world entities are of types: person, lo- cation and organization etc. Roles could be con- sidered as domain-dependent subtypes of these types. In the cases, where retrieving a subset of entities based on their roles is needed, poses the problem of defining the role and entities having those roles. This paper presents the study of study of solving Entity Role Detection prob- lem by modeling it as Named Entity Recogni- tion (NER) and Entity Retrieval/Ranking task. In NER, these roles could be considered as mutually exclusive classes and standard NER methods like sequence tagging could be used. For Entity Retrieval, Roles could be formulated as Query and entities as Collection on which the query needs to be executed. The aspect of Entity Retrieval task, which is different than document retrieval task is that the entities and roles against which they need to be retrieved are indirectly described. We have formulated au- tomated ways of learning representative words and phrases and building representations of roles and entities using them. We have also explored different contexts like sentence and document. Since the roles depend upon con- text, so it is not always possible to have large domain-specific dataset or knowledge bases for learning purposes, so we have tried to exploit the information from small dataset in domain- agnostic way.

TL;DR: 提出了EduGuardBench基准，用于评估AI教师模型的专业保真度和教育场景特有危害，发现模型性能两极分化，推理模型保真度更高，但普遍存在能力不足问题，并揭示了教育转化效应这一新的AI安全维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准无法衡量AI教师模型在角色扮演保真度和教育场景特有危害方面的表现，需要开发能全面评估专业能力、伦理安全和教学对齐的框架。

Method: 构建包含角色扮演保真度评分(RFS)和教学职业特有危害诊断的双组件基准，使用基于人设的对抗提示探测安全漏洞，评估指标包括攻击成功率(ASR)和三级拒绝质量评估。

Result: 对14个领先模型的实验显示性能两极分化，推理模型保真度更高但能力不足是主要失败模式；发现反直觉的规模悖论，中等规模模型最脆弱；识别出教育转化效应，最安全模型能将有害请求转化为可教学时刻。

Conclusion: EduGuardBench提供了超越孤立知识测试的全面评估框架，揭示了专业、伦理和教学对齐的复杂动态，对部署可信赖教育AI至关重要。

Abstract: Large Language Models for Simulating Professions (SP-LLMs), particularly as teachers, are pivotal for personalized education. However, ensuring their professional competence and ethical safety is a critical challenge, as existing benchmarks fail to measure role-playing fidelity or address the unique teaching harms inherent in educational scenarios. To address this, we propose EduGuardBench, a dual-component benchmark. It assesses professional fidelity using a Role-playing Fidelity Score (RFS) while diagnosing harms specific to the teaching profession. It also probes safety vulnerabilities using persona-based adversarial prompts targeting both general harms and, particularly, academic misconduct, evaluated with metrics including Attack Success Rate (ASR) and a three-tier Refusal Quality assessment. Our extensive experiments on 14 leading models reveal a stark polarization in performance. While reasoning-oriented models generally show superior fidelity, incompetence remains the dominant failure mode across most models. The adversarial tests uncovered a counterintuitive scaling paradox, where mid-sized models can be the most vulnerable, challenging monotonic safety assumptions. Critically, we identified a powerful Educational Transformation Effect: the safest models excel at converting harmful requests into teachable moments by providing ideal Educational Refusals. This capacity is strongly negatively correlated with ASR, revealing a new dimension of advanced AI safety. EduGuardBench thus provides a reproducible framework that moves beyond siloed knowledge tests toward a holistic assessment of professional, ethical, and pedagogical alignment, uncovering complex dynamics essential for deploying trustworthy AI in education.

Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注答案正确性，忽略了推理过程的质量评估，特别是当错误推理导致正确答案时。

Method: 构建基于树结构的推理过程评分方法RPTS，将推理步骤组织成推理树，利用层次信息为每个推理步骤分配加权忠实度分数。

Result: 创建了包含374张图像和390个推理实例的RPTS-Eval基准，评估发现开源和闭源LVLM在推理能力上存在差异。

Conclusion: RPTS-Eval基准有助于推动多模态推理研究的发展，揭示了当前LVLM在推理过程中的局限性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) excel in multimodal reasoning and have shown impressive performance on various multimodal benchmarks. However, most of these benchmarks evaluate models primarily through multiple-choice or short-answer formats, which do not take the reasoning process into account. Although some benchmarks assess the reasoning process, their methods are often overly simplistic and only examine reasoning when answers are incorrect. This approach overlooks scenarios where flawed reasoning leads to correct answers. In addition, these benchmarks do not consider the impact of intermodal relationships on reasoning. To address this issue, we propose the Reasoning Process Tree Score (RPTS), a tree structure-based metric to assess reasoning processes. Specifically, we organize the reasoning steps into a reasoning tree and leverage its hierarchical information to assign weighted faithfulness scores to each reasoning step. By dynamically adjusting these weights, RPTS not only evaluates the overall correctness of the reasoning, but also pinpoints where the model fails in the reasoning. To validate RPTS in real-world multimodal scenarios, we construct a new benchmark, RPTS-Eval, comprising 374 images and 390 reasoning instances. Each instance includes reliable visual-textual clues that serve as leaf nodes of the reasoning tree. Furthermore, we define three types of intermodal relationships to investigate how intermodal interactions influence the reasoning process. We evaluated representative LVLMs (e.g., GPT4o, Llava-Next), uncovering their limitations in multimodal reasoning and highlighting the differences between open-source and closed-source commercial LVLMs. We believe that this benchmark will contribute to the advancement of research in the field of multimodal reasoning.

Motivation: 为了解决LLM生成的可信内容可能导致的错误信息和社会问题，需要开发高效可靠的方法来识别文本来源。现有方法在面对高级LLM输出或对抗性多任务机器修订文本时表现不佳。

Method: 提出人类语言偏好检测(HLPD)，采用基于奖励的对齐过程(HLPO)将评分模型的token分布转向人类写作风格，使模型对人类写作更敏感。

Result: 在检测GPT系列模型修订文本时，HLPD比ImBD相对提升15.11% AUROC，比Fast-DetectGPT提升45.56%。在高级LLM生成文本评估中，HLPD达到最高平均AUROC，超过ImBD 5.53%，超过Fast-DetectGPT 34.14%。

Conclusion: HLPD通过人类语言偏好优化有效提升了机器修订文本的检测性能，在对抗性多任务场景下显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: To prevent misinformation and social issues arising from trustworthy-looking content generated by LLMs, it is crucial to develop efficient and reliable methods for identifying the source of texts. Previous approaches have demonstrated exceptional performance in detecting texts fully generated by LLMs. However, these methods struggle when confronting more advanced LLM output or text with adversarial multi-task machine revision, especially in the black-box setting, where the generating model is unknown. To address this challenge, grounded in the hypothesis that human writing possesses distinctive stylistic patterns, we propose Human Language Preference Detection (HLPD). HLPD employs a reward-based alignment process, Human Language Preference Optimization (HLPO), to shift the scoring model's token distribution toward human-like writing, making the model more sensitive to human writing, therefore enhancing the identification of machine-revised text. We test HLPD in an adversarial multi-task evaluation framework that leverages a five-dimensional prompt generator and multiple advanced LLMs to create diverse revision scenarios. When detecting texts revised by GPT-series models, HLPD achieves a 15.11% relative improvement in AUROC over ImBD, surpassing Fast-DetectGPT by 45.56%. When evaluated on texts generated by advanced LLMs, HLPD achieves the highest average AUROC, exceeding ImBD by 5.53% and Fast-DetectGPT by 34.14%.

Abstract: This article presents two corpora of English and Czech texts generated with large language models (LLMs). The motivation is to create a resource for comparing human-written texts with LLM-generated text linguistically. Emphasis was placed on ensuring these resources are multi-genre and rich in terms of topics, authors, and text types, while maintaining comparability with existing human-created corpora. These generated corpora replicate reference human corpora: BE21 by Paul Baker, which is a modern version of the original Brown Corpus, and Koditex corpus that also follows the Brown Corpus tradition but in Czech. The new corpora were generated using models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Alphabet, Meta, and DeepSeek, ranging from GPT-3 (davinci-002) to GPT-4.5, and are tagged according to the Universal Dependencies standard (i.e., they are tokenized, lemmatized, and morphologically and syntactically annotated). The subcorpus size varies according to the model used (the English part contains on average 864k tokens per model, 27M tokens altogether, the Czech partcontains on average 768k tokens per model, 21.5M tokens altogether). The corpora are freely available for download under the CC BY 4.0 license (the annotated data are under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 licence) and are also accessible through the search interface of the Czech National Corpus.

Motivation: 大型语言模型有时会无意中复制受版权保护的内容，给下游应用带来法律风险。现有推理时防御方法主要关注表层token匹配，依赖外部阻止列表或过滤器，增加了部署复杂性且可能忽略语义层面的泄露。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器将隐藏状态投影到高维近单语义空间，识别版权敏感子空间，并在解码过程中钳制该子空间的激活。

Result: 在广泛认可的基准测试中，SCOPE有效缓解了版权侵权问题，同时不降低模型的通用效用。

Conclusion: 该方法将版权侵权缓解重新定义为内在语义空间控制，可解释性分析证实隔离的子空间确实捕获了高级语义信息。

Abstract: Large language models sometimes inadvertently reproduce passages that are copyrighted, exposing downstream applications to legal risk. Most existing studies for inference-time defences focus on surface-level token matching and rely on external blocklists or filters, which add deployment complexity and may overlook semantically paraphrased leakage. In this work, we reframe copyright infringement mitigation as intrinsic semantic-space control and introduce SCOPE, an inference-time method that requires no parameter updates or auxiliary filters. Specifically, the sparse autoencoder (SAE) projects hidden states into a high-dimensional, near-monosemantic space; benefiting from this representation, we identify a copyright-sensitive subspace and clamp its activations during decoding.

### [287] [Automated Circuit Interpretation via Probe Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07002)
*Giuseppe Birardi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为probe prompting的自动化方法，将归因图转换为紧凑、可解释的子图，通过概念对齐的超级节点来加速神经网络特征路径的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机械可解释性旨在理解神经网络中哪些学习特征介导特定行为。归因图揭示了这些特征路径，但解释它们需要大量手动分析——单个提示需要约2小时。

Method: 从种子提示和目标logit开始，选择高影响力特征，生成概念目标但上下文变化的探针，使用透明决策规则将特征按跨提示激活签名分组为语义、关系和Say-X类别。

Result: 在五个提示测试中，probe-prompted子图保持高解释覆盖率同时压缩复杂性（完整性0.83，替换度0.54）。与几何聚类基线相比，概念对齐组表现出更高的行为一致性：峰值标记一致性高2.3倍，激活模式相似度高5.8倍。实体交换测试揭示了层级结构：早期层特征稳健转移（64%转移率），晚期层Say-X特征专门用于输出促进。

Conclusion: 支持transformer计算的骨干-专业化视图，并发布了代码、交互演示和最小化工件，便于复现和社区采用。

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability aims to understand neural networks by identifying which learned features mediate specific behaviors. Attribution graphs reveal these feature pathways, but interpreting them requires extensive manual analysis -- a single prompt can take approximately 2 hours for an experienced circuit tracer. We present probe prompting, an automated pipeline that transforms attribution graphs into compact, interpretable subgraphs built from concept-aligned supernodes. Starting from a seed prompt and target logit, we select high-influence features, generate concept-targeted yet context-varying probes, and group features by cross-prompt activation signatures into Semantic, Relationship, and Say-X categories using transparent decision rules.
  Across five prompts including classic "capitals" circuits, probe-prompted subgraphs preserve high explanatory coverage while compressing complexity (Completeness 0.83, mean across circuits; Replacement 0.54). Compared to geometric clustering baselines, concept-aligned groups exhibit higher behavioral coherence: 2.3x higher peak-token consistency (0.425 vs 0.183) and 5.8x higher activation-pattern similarity (0.762 vs 0.130), despite lower geometric compactness. Entity-swap tests reveal a layerwise hierarchy: early-layer features transfer robustly (64% transfer rate, mean layer 6.3), while late-layer Say-X features specialize for output promotion (mean layer 16.4), supporting a backbone-and-specialization view of transformer computation.
  We release code (https://github.com/peppinob-ol/attribution-graph-probing), an interactive demo (https://huggingface.co/spaces/Peppinob/attribution-graph-probing), and minimal artifacts enabling immediate reproduction and community adoption.

TL;DR: LMT是一个以中英文为中心的大规模多语言翻译模型套件，涵盖60种语言和234个翻译方向，通过战略下采样和并行多语言提示技术解决方向性退化问题，在4B参数规模下超越了更大的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多语言机器翻译中的广泛语言覆盖、一致翻译质量和英语中心偏见等挑战，特别是发现并解决方向性退化现象。

Method: 提出战略下采样方法缓解方向性退化，设计并行多语言提示利用类型学相关辅助语言增强跨语言迁移，通过严格数据筛选和优化适应策略。

Result: LMT在同等语言覆盖范围的模型中达到SOTA性能，4B模型大幅超越Aya-101-13B和NLLB-54B等更大模型。

Conclusion: LMT为包容性、可扩展和高质量的多语言机器翻译提供了强大的基准模型，并发布了四种规模版本以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Large language models have significantly advanced Multilingual Machine Translation (MMT), yet the broad language coverage, consistent translation quality, and English-centric bias remain open challenges. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{LMT}, a suite of \textbf{L}arge-scale \textbf{M}ultilingual \textbf{T}ranslation models centered on both Chinese and English, covering 60 languages and 234 translation directions. During development, we identify a previously overlooked phenomenon of \textbf{directional degeneration}, where symmetric multi-way fine-tuning data overemphasize reverse directions (X $\to$ En/Zh), leading to excessive many-to-one mappings and degraded translation quality. We propose \textbf{Strategic Downsampling}, a simple yet effective method to mitigate this degeneration. In addition, we design \textbf{Parallel Multilingual Prompting (PMP)}, which leverages typologically related auxiliary languages to enhance cross-lingual transfer. Through rigorous data curation and refined adaptation strategies, LMT achieves SOTA performance among models of comparable language coverage, with our 4B model (LMT-60-4B) surpassing the much larger Aya-101-13B and NLLB-54B models by a substantial margin. We release LMT in four sizes (0.6B/1.7B/4B/8B) to catalyze future research and provide strong baselines for inclusive, scalable, and high-quality MMT \footnote{\href{https://github.com/NiuTrans/LMT}{https://github.com/NiuTrans/LMT}}.

TL;DR: 提出了一个两阶段的英语-印度语言翻译系统，通过视觉增强的错误检测与修正管道自动清理训练数据，然后使用LoRA微调IndicTrans2模型，在多个语言对上取得了BLEU分数的提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决训练数据中的质量问题，包括视觉歧义和翻译错误，以提高英语到印度语言翻译的性能。

Method: 使用视觉增强的judge-corrector管道自动检测和修正训练数据中的错误，然后使用LoRA对IndicTrans2模型进行参数高效微调。

Result: 在四个语言对上的BLEU分数均有提升：英语-孟加拉语评估集+1.30，挑战集+0.70；英语-奥里亚语评估集+0.60；英语-印地语挑战集+0.10。

Conclusion: 自动数据清理和参数高效微调相结合的方法能有效提升多语言翻译质量，特别是在数据质量存在问题的场景下。

Abstract: In this paper, we describe our system under the team name BLEU Monday for the English-to-Indic Multimodal Translation Task at WAT 2025. We participate in the text-only translation tasks for English-Hindi, English-Bengali, English-Malayalam, and English-Odia language pairs. We present a two-stage approach that addresses quality issues in the training data through automated error detection and correction, followed by parameter-efficient model fine-tuning.
  Our methodology introduces a vision-augmented judge-corrector pipeline that leverages multimodal language models to systematically identify and correct translation errors in the training data. The judge component classifies translations into three categories: correct, visually ambiguous (requiring image context), or mistranslated (poor translation quality). Identified errors are routed to specialized correctors: GPT-4o-mini regenerates captions requiring visual disambiguation, while IndicTrans2 retranslates cases with pure translation quality issues. This automated pipeline processes 28,928 training examples across four languages, correcting an average of 17.1% of captions per language.
  We then apply Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the IndicTrans2 en-indic 200M distilled model on both original and corrected datasets. Training on corrected data yields consistent improvements, with BLEU score gains of +1.30 for English-Bengali on the evaluation set (42.00 -> 43.30) and +0.70 on the challenge set (44.90 -> 45.60), +0.60 for English-Odia on the evaluation set (41.00 -> 41.60), and +0.10 for English-Hindi on the challenge set (53.90 -> 54.00).

TL;DR: 本研究探索了通过移动设备收集的语音数据与抑郁症症状严重程度之间的关系，发现在英语数据中症状严重程度与词汇多样性、绝对主义语言等7个特征相关，但在非英语数据中关联较弱，预测性能接近随机水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用移动设备收集的语音数据进行客观、定期的抑郁症症状评估和早期复发检测，但现有研究多基于非临床样本的书面语言，且机器学习方法复杂、可解释性有限。

Method: 对RADAR-MDD研究中5,836条录音的纵向语音数据和PHQ-8评估进行探索性分析，使用线性混合效应模型识别与抑郁症症状严重程度相关的可解释词汇特征，并测试四种回归机器学习模型的预测性能。

Result: 英语数据中抑郁症症状严重程度与7个特征相关（包括词汇多样性测量和绝对主义语言），荷兰语中与句子词数和积极词频相关，西班牙语中未观察到关联。词汇特征和向量嵌入的预测能力在所有语言中都接近随机水平。

Conclusion: 需要在更大样本、多种语言中使用改进协议和考虑个体内外语言变异的机器学习模型，进一步研究词汇标记在临床研究和实践中的价值。

Abstract: Background: Captured between clinical appointments using mobile devices, spoken language has potential for objective, more regular assessment of symptom severity and earlier detection of relapse in major depressive disorder. However, research to date has largely been in non-clinical cross-sectional samples of written language using complex machine learning (ML) approaches with limited interpretability.
  Methods: We describe an initial exploratory analysis of longitudinal speech data and PHQ-8 assessments from 5,836 recordings of 586 participants in the UK, Netherlands, and Spain, collected in the RADAR-MDD study. We sought to identify interpretable lexical features associated with MDD symptom severity with linear mixed-effects modelling. Interpretable features and high-dimensional vector embeddings were also used to test the prediction performance of four regressor ML models.
  Results: In English data, MDD symptom severity was associated with 7 features including lexical diversity measures and absolutist language. In Dutch, associations were observed with words per sentence and positive word frequency; no associations were observed in recordings collected in Spain. The predictive power of lexical features and vector embeddings was near chance level across all languages.
  Limitations: Smaller samples in non-English speech and methodological choices, such as the elicitation prompt, may have also limited the effect sizes observable. A lack of NLP tools in languages other than English restricted our feature choice.
  Conclusion: To understand the value of lexical markers in clinical research and practice, further research is needed in larger samples across several languages using improved protocols, and ML models that account for within- and between-individual variations in language.

Result: 在检索、分类和语义文本相似性等所有主要嵌入任务中表现优异，在多语言场景特别是低资源语言和跨语言设置中表现突出。

Conclusion: 该模型结合了顶级性能、广泛适用性和用户驱动的灵活性，可作为通用文本嵌入解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce llama-embed-nemotron-8b, an open-weights text embedding model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Multilingual Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MMTEB) leaderboard as of October 21, 2025. While recent models show strong performance, their training data or methodologies are often not fully disclosed. We aim to address this by developing a fully open-source model, publicly releasing its weights and detailed ablation studies, and planning to share the curated training datasets. Our model demonstrates superior performance across all major embedding tasks -- including retrieval, classification and semantic textual similarity (STS) -- and excels in challenging multilingual scenarios, such as low-resource languages and cross-lingual setups. This state-of-the-art performance is driven by a novel data mix of 16.1 million query-document pairs, split between 7.7 million samples from public datasets and 8.4 million synthetically generated examples from various open-weight LLMs. One of our key contributions is a detailed ablation study analyzing core design choices, including a comparison of contrastive loss implementations, an evaluation of synthetic data generation (SDG) strategies, and the impact of model merging. The llama-embed-nemotron-8b is an instruction-aware model, supporting user-defined instructions to enhance performance for specific use-cases. This combination of top-tier performance, broad applicability, and user-driven flexibility enables it to serve as a universal text embedding solution.

Abstract: Mental health disorders affect over one-fifth of adults globally, yet detecting such conditions from text remains challenging due to the subtle and varied nature of symptom expression. This study evaluates multiple approaches for mental health detection, comparing Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Llama and GPT with classical machine learning and transformer-based architectures including BERT, XLNet, and Distil-RoBERTa. Using the DAIC-WOZ dataset of clinical interviews, we fine-tuned models for anxiety, depression, and stress classification and applied synthetic data generation to mitigate class imbalance. Results show that Distil-RoBERTa achieved the highest F1 score (0.883) for GAD-2, while XLNet outperformed others on PHQ tasks (F1 up to 0.891). For stress detection, a zero-shot synthetic approach (SD+Zero-Shot-Basic) reached an F1 of 0.884 and ROC AUC of 0.886. Findings demonstrate the effectiveness of transformer-based models and highlight the value of synthetic data in improving recall and generalization. However, careful calibration is required to prevent precision loss. Overall, this work emphasizes the potential of combining advanced language models and data augmentation to enhance automated mental health assessment from text.

Motivation: 在许多应用中，仅提供最小充分证据是不够的，需要识别完整的贡献特征集，特别是在合规性和编目等场景下。

Method: 在包含人工标注完整证据的医学数据集上进行案例研究，分析单个模型和集成模型的表现，研究召回率-精确度权衡、证据训练的作用以及带确定性阈值的动态集成。

Result: 单个模型通常只能恢复完整证据的子集，证据召回率约为0.60；通过集成多个模型，证据召回率可提升至约0.86。

Conclusion: 模型集成能显著提高完整证据的识别能力，在需要完整证据的应用中具有重要价值，同时需要权衡召回率和精确度。

Abstract: Feature attribution methods typically provide minimal sufficient evidence justifying a model decision. However, in many applications this is inadequate. For compliance and cataloging, the full set of contributing features must be identified - complete evidence. We perform a case study on a medical dataset which contains human-annotated complete evidence. We show that individual models typically recover only subsets of complete evidence and that aggregating evidence from several models improves evidence recall from $\sim$0.60 (single best model) to $\sim$0.86 (ensemble). We analyze the recall-precision trade-off, the role of training with evidence, dynamic ensembles with certainty thresholds, and discuss implications.

Conclusion: 将人类理性标注融入注意力机制可以在不损害公平性的前提下增强可解释性和忠实性

Abstract: The opaque nature of deep learning models presents significant challenges for the ethical deployment of hate speech detection systems. To address this limitation, we introduce Supervised Rational Attention (SRA), a framework that explicitly aligns model attention with human rationales, improving both interpretability and fairness in hate speech classification. SRA integrates a supervised attention mechanism into transformer-based classifiers, optimizing a joint objective that combines standard classification loss with an alignment loss term that minimizes the discrepancy between attention weights and human-annotated rationales. We evaluated SRA on hate speech benchmarks in English (HateXplain) and Portuguese (HateBRXplain) with rationale annotations. Empirically, SRA achieves 2.4x better explainability compared to current baselines, and produces token-level explanations that are more faithful and human-aligned. In terms of fairness, SRA achieves competitive fairness across all measures, with second-best performance in detecting toxic posts targeting identity groups, while maintaining comparable results on other metrics. These findings demonstrate that incorporating human rationales into attention mechanisms can enhance interpretability and faithfulness without compromising fairness.

Result: 实验结果显示仅基于MIWV选择前1%的数据就能超越在全数据集上的训练效果

Conclusion: MIWV方法超越了现有专注于数据质量评分的研究，为所提方法的有效性提供了强有力的实证证据

Abstract: Instruction tuning plays a critical role in enhancing the performance and efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs). Its success depends not only on the quality of the instruction data but also on the inherent capabilities of the LLM itself. Some studies suggest that even a small amount of high-quality data can achieve instruction fine-tuning results that are on par with, or even exceed, those from using a full-scale dataset. However, rather than focusing solely on calculating data quality scores to evaluate instruction data, there is a growing need to select high-quality data that maximally enhances the performance of instruction tuning for a given LLM. In this paper, we propose the Model Instruction Weakness Value (MIWV) as a novel metric to quantify the importance of instruction data in enhancing model's capabilities. The MIWV metric is derived from the discrepancies in the model's responses when using In-Context Learning (ICL), helping identify the most beneficial data for enhancing instruction tuning performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that selecting only the top 1\% of data based on MIWV can outperform training on the full dataset. Furthermore, this approach extends beyond existing research that focuses on data quality scoring for data selection, offering strong empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Abstract: Emotion detection from text seeks to identify an individual's emotional or mental state - positive, negative, or neutral - based on linguistic cues. While significant progress has been made for English and other high-resource languages, Bengali remains underexplored despite being the world's fourth most spoken language. The lack of large, standardized datasets classifies Bengali as a low-resource language for emotion detection. Existing studies mainly employ classical machine learning models with traditional feature engineering, yielding limited performance. In this paper, we introduce a new Bengali emotion dataset annotated across eight emotion categories and propose two models for automatic emotion detection: (i) a hybrid Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) model (EmoBangHybrid) and (ii) an AdaBoost-Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) ensemble model (EmoBangEnsemble). Additionally, we evaluate six baseline models with five feature engineering techniques and assess zero-shot and few-shot large language models (LLMs) on the dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive benchmark for Bengali emotion detection. Experimental results show that EmoBangH and EmoBangE achieve accuracies of 92.86% and 93.69%, respectively, outperforming existing methods and establishing strong baselines for future research.

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) depends heavily on the quality and scale of their pre-training datasets. Recent research shows that large multimodal models trained on natural documents where images and text are interleaved outperform those trained only on image-text pairs across a wide range of benchmarks, leveraging advanced pre- trained models to enforce semantic alignment, image-sequence consistency, and textual coherence. For Arabic, however, the lack of high-quality multimodal datasets that preserve document structure has limited progress. In this paper, we present our pipeline Wasm for processing the Common Crawl dataset to create a new Arabic multimodal dataset that uniquely provides markdown output. Unlike existing Arabic corpora that focus solely on text extraction, our approach preserves the structural integrity of web content while maintaining flexibility for both text-only and multimodal pre-training scenarios. We provide a comprehensive comparative analysis of our data processing pipeline against those used for major existing datasets, highlighting the convergences in filtering strategies and justifying our specific design choices. To support future research, we publicly release a representative dataset dump along with the multimodal processing pipeline for Arabic.

Motivation: 研究多智能体LLM系统在面对对抗性输入时的鲁棒性，特别是数学问题中的标点符号噪声和人为拼写错误的影响。

Method: 使用Agent Forest统一采样和投票框架，在6个开源模型上评估1-25个智能体，测试4个数学基准上的对抗性扰动（标点符号噪声和人为拼写错误）。

Result: 噪声类型影响显著：标点符号噪声危害随强度增加，人为拼写错误是主要瓶颈；协作确实提高准确率，但对抗性鲁棒性差距持续存在。

Conclusion: 多智能体协作能提高准确率，但无法完全解决对抗性鲁棒性问题，人为拼写错误仍是主要挑战。

Abstract: When LLM agents work together, they seem to be more powerful than a single LLM in mathematical question answering. However, are they also more robust to adversarial inputs? We investigate this question using adversarially perturbed math questions. These perturbations include punctuation noise with three intensities (10, 30, and 50 percent), plus real-world and human-like typos (WikiTypo, R2ATA). Using a unified sampling-and-voting framework (Agent Forest), we evaluate six open-source models (Qwen3-4B/14B, Llama3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, Gemma3-4B/12B) across four benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH, MMLU-Math, MultiArith), with various numbers of agents n from one to 25 (1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25). Our findings show that (1) Noise type matters: punctuation noise harm scales with its severity, and the human typos remain the dominant bottleneck, yielding the largest gaps to Clean accuracy and the highest ASR even with a large number of agents. And (2) Collaboration reliably improves accuracy as the number of agents, n, increases, with the largest gains from one to five agents and diminishing returns beyond 10 agents. However, the adversarial robustness gap persists regardless of the agent count.

Result: 在数学、常识和符号推理基准测试中显著提升了LLMs多步推理的一致性和效率

Conclusion: EBM-CoT框架能够在不修改基础语言模型的情况下，有效提高推理的一致性和准确性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities through \emph{Chain-of-Thought} (CoT) prompting, which enables step-by-step intermediate reasoning. However, explicit CoT methods rely on discrete token-level reasoning processes that are prone to error propagation and limited by vocabulary expressiveness, often resulting in rigid and inconsistent reasoning trajectories. Recent research has explored implicit or continuous reasoning in latent spaces, allowing models to perform internal reasoning before generating explicit output. Although such approaches alleviate some limitations of discrete CoT, they generally lack explicit mechanisms to enforce consistency among reasoning steps, leading to divergent reasoning paths and unstable outcomes. To address this issue, we propose EBM-CoT, an Energy-Based Chain-of-Thought Calibration framework that refines latent thought representations through an energy-based model (EBM). Our method dynamically adjusts latent reasoning trajectories toward lower-energy, high-consistency regions in the embedding space, improving both reasoning accuracy and consistency without modifying the base language model. Extensive experiments across mathematical, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly enhances the consistency and efficiency of multi-step reasoning in LLMs.

*Seungeon Lee,Soumi Das,Manish Gupta,Krishna P. Gummadi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LoRA on the Go (LoGo)是一个无需训练的动态适配器选择和合并框架，能够在实例级别自动选择和合并LoRA适配器，无需额外数据或训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LoRA适配器通常针对单一任务训练，限制了在现实世界多样化输入场景中的应用。现有方法需要标注数据或额外训练，在大规模应用中成本高昂。

Method: LoGo通过单次前向传播提取信号，动态识别最相关的适配器并实时确定其贡献度，无需任何训练过程。

Result: 在5个NLP基准测试、27个数据集和3个模型系列上，LoGo在某些任务上比基于训练的方法高出3.6%，在其他任务上保持竞争力，同时维持推理吞吐量。

Conclusion: LoGo展示了在多样化任务上无需训练即可有效选择和合并适配器的能力，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a parameter-efficient approach for fine-tuning large language models.However, conventional LoRA adapters are typically trained for a single task, limiting their applicability in real-world settings where inputs may span diverse and unpredictable domains. At inference time, existing approaches combine multiple LoRAs for improving performance on diverse tasks, while usually requiring labeled data or additional task-specific training, which is expensive at scale. In this work, we introduce LoRA on the Go (LoGo), a training-free framework that dynamically selects and merges adapters at the instance level without any additional requirements. LoGo leverages signals extracted from a single forward pass through LoRA adapters, to identify the most relevant adapters and determine their contributions on-the-fly. Across 5 NLP benchmarks, 27 datasets, and 3 model families, LoGo outperforms training-based baselines on some tasks upto a margin of 3.6% while remaining competitive on other tasks and maintaining inference throughput, highlighting its effectiveness and practicality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中医领域缺乏标准化基准测试和高质量训练数据，限制了大型语言模型在中医领域的应用。

Result: 开发了中医专用大语言模型ZhiMingTang，显著超过人类从业者合格标准。

Conclusion: 发布了公开排行榜以促进社区参与和持续改进，为中医领域的大语言模型研究提供了重要基准和工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in modern medicine, yet their application in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) remains severely limited by the absence of standardized benchmarks and the scarcity of high-quality training data. To address these challenges, we introduce TCM-Eval, the first dynamic and extensible benchmark for TCM, meticulously curated from national medical licensing examinations and validated by TCM experts. Furthermore, we construct a large-scale training corpus and propose Self-Iterative Chain-of-Thought Enhancement (SI-CoTE) to autonomously enrich question-answer pairs with validated reasoning chains through rejection sampling, establishing a virtuous cycle of data and model co-evolution. Using this enriched training data, we develop ZhiMingTang (ZMT), a state-of-the-art LLM specifically designed for TCM, which significantly exceeds the passing threshold for human practitioners. To encourage future research and development, we release a public leaderboard, fostering community engagement and continuous improvement.

### [302] [Categorical Emotions or Appraisals - Which Emotion Model Explains Argument Convincingness Better?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07162)
*Lynn Greschner,Meike Bauer,Sabine Weber,Roman Klinger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文评估了评价理论在论证情感分析中的适用性，发现相比传统情感分类，基于评价理论的情感评估能更有效地预测论证说服力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 论证说服力不仅取决于逻辑结构和论证者信誉，还受接收者情感影响。现有研究关注情感强度和分类，但忽略了情感的主观性，即接收者的目标、标准、先验知识和立场如何影响情感反应。

Method: 基于ContArgA语料库的标注，进行零样本提示实验，评估黄金标注和预测的情感及评价对主观说服力标签评估的重要性。

Result: 研究发现，虽然分类情感信息确实能改善说服力预测，但使用评价理论获得的改进更为显著。

Conclusion: 这是首次系统比较情感模型在说服力预测中的表现，证明了评价理论的优势，为计算论证的理论和实践应用提供了见解。

Abstract: The convincingness of an argument does not only depend on its structure (logos), the person who makes the argument (ethos), but also on the emotion that it causes in the recipient (pathos). While the overall intensity and categorical values of emotions in arguments have received considerable attention in the research community, we argue that the emotion an argument evokes in a recipient is subjective. It depends on the recipient's goals, standards, prior knowledge, and stance. Appraisal theories lend themselves as a link between the subjective cognitive assessment of events and emotions. They have been used in event-centric emotion analysis, but their suitability for assessing argument convincingness remains unexplored. In this paper, we evaluate whether appraisal theories are suitable for emotion analysis in arguments by considering subjective cognitive evaluations of the importance and impact of an argument on its receiver. Based on the annotations in the recently published ContArgA corpus, we perform zero-shot prompting experiments to evaluate the importance of gold-annotated and predicted emotions and appraisals for the assessment of the subjective convincingness labels. We find that, while categorical emotion information does improve convincingness prediction, the improvement is more pronounced with appraisals. This work presents the first systematic comparison between emotion models for convincingness prediction, demonstrating the advantage of appraisals, providing insights for theoretical and practical applications in computational argumentation.

*Meiyun Wang,Charin Polpanumas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdaRec是一个基于大语言模型的少样本上下文学习框架，通过叙事化用户画像将用户-物品交互转化为自然语言表示，实现自适应个性化推荐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的推荐方法需要手动特征工程，且难以处理少样本和零样本场景。AdaRec旨在消除手动特征工程，支持快速跨任务适应，并在最小监督下实现长尾个性化。

Method: 采用双通道架构：水平行为对齐（发现同伴驱动模式）和垂直因果归因（突出用户偏好的决定性因素）。通过语义表示统一处理任务，支持少样本和零样本学习。

Result: 在真实电商数据集上，AdaRec在少样本设置中比机器学习和基于LLM的基线方法提升最多8%；在零样本场景中比专家构建的画像提升最多19%。轻量级微调可达到完全微调模型的性能。

Conclusion: AdaRec通过叙事化用户画像和双通道推理范式，有效解决了少样本个性化推荐问题，展示了在最小交互数据下实现长尾个性化的能力，具有高效的跨任务泛化性能。

Abstract: We propose AdaRec, a few-shot in-context learning framework that leverages large language models for an adaptive personalized recommendation. AdaRec introduces narrative profiling, transforming user-item interactions into natural language representations to enable unified task handling and enhance human readability. Centered on a bivariate reasoning paradigm, AdaRec employs a dual-channel architecture that integrates horizontal behavioral alignment, discovering peer-driven patterns, with vertical causal attribution, highlighting decisive factors behind user preferences. Unlike existing LLM-based approaches, AdaRec eliminates manual feature engineering through semantic representations and supports rapid cross-task adaptation with minimal supervision. Experiments on real ecommerce datasets demonstrate that AdaRec outperforms both machine learning models and LLM-based baselines by up to eight percent in few-shot settings. In zero-shot scenarios, it achieves up to a nineteen percent improvement over expert-crafted profiling, showing effectiveness for long-tail personalization with minimal interaction data. Furthermore, lightweight fine-tuning on synthetic data generated by AdaRec matches the performance of fully fine-tuned models, highlighting its efficiency and generalization across diverse tasks.

*Jiacheng Huang,Ning Yu,Xiaoyin Yi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EMODIS是一个评估大语言模型在对比性文本语境下解析模糊表情符号能力的新基准，发现即使最强模型在仅有细微语境线索时也难以区分含义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型越来越多地部署在真实世界通信环境中，但其解决语境依赖模糊性的能力仍未充分探索。

Method: 创建EMODIS基准，每个实例包含带表情符号的模糊句子、两个导致不同解释的消歧语境，以及需要语境推理的特定问题。评估开源和基于API的LLM。

Result: 即使最强模型在仅有细微语境线索时也经常无法区分含义，分析显示存在系统性偏向主导解释和对语用对比的有限敏感性。

Conclusion: EMODIS为评估语境消歧提供了严格测试平台，突显了人类与LLM在语义推理方面的差距。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world communication settings, yet their ability to resolve context-dependent ambiguity remains underexplored. In this work, we present EMODIS, a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs' capacity to interpret ambiguous emoji expressions under minimal but contrastive textual contexts. Each instance in EMODIS comprises an ambiguous sentence containing an emoji, two distinct disambiguating contexts that lead to divergent interpretations, and a specific question that requires contextual reasoning. We evaluate both open-source and API-based LLMs, and find that even the strongest models frequently fail to distinguish meanings when only subtle contextual cues are present. Further analysis reveals systematic biases toward dominant interpretations and limited sensitivity to pragmatic contrast. EMODIS provides a rigorous testbed for assessing contextual disambiguation, and highlights the gap in semantic reasoning between humans and LLMs.

TL;DR: TransGraph是一个基于话语图指导的文档翻译框架，通过显式建模块间关系来提升长文档翻译质量，在减少计算开销的同时超越了现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在完整文档翻译中面临长距离依赖和话语连贯性保持的挑战，现有多智能体翻译系统虽然缓解了上下文窗口限制，但计算资源需求大且对记忆检索策略敏感。

Method: 引入TransGraph框架，通过结构化话语图显式建模块间关系，并选择性基于相关图邻域条件化每个翻译片段，而非依赖顺序或穷尽上下文。

Result: 在涵盖六种语言和多个领域的三个文档级机器翻译基准测试中，TransGraph在翻译质量和术语一致性方面持续超越强基线，同时显著降低了token开销。

Conclusion: TransGraph通过话语图引导的方法有效解决了文档翻译中的长距离依赖问题，在保证翻译质量的同时大幅减少了计算资源需求。

Abstract: Adapting large language models to full document translation remains challenging due to the difficulty of capturing long-range dependencies and preserving discourse coherence throughout extended texts. While recent agentic machine translation systems mitigate context window constraints through multi-agent orchestration and persistent memory, they require substantial computational resources and are sensitive to memory retrieval strategies. We introduce TransGraph, a discourse-guided framework that explicitly models inter-chunk relationships through structured discourse graphs and selectively conditions each translation segment on relevant graph neighbourhoods rather than relying on sequential or exhaustive context. Across three document-level MT benchmarks spanning six languages and diverse domains, TransGraph consistently surpasses strong baselines in translation quality and terminology consistency while incurring significantly lower token overhead.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了主角实体识别（PER）任务，用于识别新闻故事中起核心作用的组织实体，并通过LLM验证其可行性和扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NER将所有实体提及同等对待，无法区分真正推动叙事的核心组织，限制了基于事件重要性、影响力或叙事焦点的下游任务。

Method: 比较LLM预测与专家标注的一致性，使用NER引导提示自动标注大规模新闻数据，评估LLM在有限上下文和无明确候选指导下的表现。

Result: 建立了标注者间一致性和人机一致性，证明PER是可行的叙事中心信息提取扩展，引导的LLM能够大规模近似人类对叙事重要性的判断。

Conclusion: PER是一个有意义的信息提取任务扩展，LLM能够有效识别新闻叙事中的核心组织实体，为大规模应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: News articles often reference numerous organizations, but traditional Named Entity Recognition (NER) treats all mentions equally, obscuring which entities genuinely drive the narrative. This limits downstream tasks that rely on understanding event salience, influence, or narrative focus. We introduce Protagonist Entity Recognition (PER), a task that identifies the organizations that anchor a news story and shape its main developments. To validate PER, we compare he predictions of Large Language Models (LLMs) against annotations from four expert annotators over a gold corpus, establishing both inter-annotator consistency and human-LLM agreement. Leveraging these findings, we use state-of-the-art LLMs to automatically label large-scale news collections through NER-guided prompting, generating scalable, high-quality supervision. We then evaluate whether other LLMs, given reduced context and without explicit candidate guidance, can still infer the correct protagonists. Our results demonstrate that PER is a feasible and meaningful extension to narrative-centered information extraction, and that guided LLMs can approximate human judgments of narrative importance at scale.

Method: 对于子任务1A和1B使用transformer模型的软投票集成（BanglaBERT、MuRIL、IndicBERTv2），对于子任务1C使用三个多任务变体并通过加权投票集成聚合预测。

Result: 系统在三个子任务中分别获得72.75%、72.69%和72.62%的micro-f1分数，在排行榜上分别排名第9、第10和第7位。

Conclusion: transformer集成和加权多任务框架在低资源环境下推进孟加拉语仇恨言论检测方面显示出良好前景。

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of Bangla hate speech identification, a socially impactful yet linguistically challenging task. As part of the "Bangla Multi-task Hate Speech Identification" shared task at the BLP Workshop, IJCNLP-AACL 2025, our team "Retriv" participated in all three subtasks: (1A) hate type classification, (1B) target group identification, and (1C) joint detection of type, severity, and target. For subtasks 1A and 1B, we employed a soft-voting ensemble of transformer models (BanglaBERT, MuRIL, IndicBERTv2). For subtask 1C, we trained three multitask variants and aggregated their predictions through a weighted voting ensemble. Our systems achieved micro-f1 scores of 72.75% (1A) and 72.69% (1B), and a weighted micro-f1 score of 72.62% (1C). On the shared task leaderboard, these corresponded to 9th, 10th, and 7th positions, respectively. These results highlight the promise of transformer ensembles and weighted multitask frameworks for advancing Bangla hate speech detection in low-resource contexts. We made experimental scripts publicly available for the community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ICD编码方法主要关注代码层次结构和同义词理解，但忽视了临床笔记中普遍使用的医学缩写，这是ICD代码推断的关键因素。

Method: 使用大语言模型扩展医学缩写进行数据增强，并结合一致性训练来规范化预测，强制原始文档和增强文档之间的预测一致性。

Result: 在MIMIC-III数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在常见代码、罕见代码和完整代码分配等多个设置下都建立了新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: 提出的ACE-ICD方法通过有效处理医学缩写问题，显著提升了自动ICD编码的性能，代码已公开可用。

Abstract: Automatic ICD coding, the task of assigning disease and procedure codes to electronic medical records, is crucial for clinical documentation and billing. While existing methods primarily enhance model understanding of code hierarchies and synonyms, they often overlook the pervasive use of medical acronyms in clinical notes, a key factor in ICD code inference. To address this gap, we propose a novel effective data augmentation technique that leverages large language models to expand medical acronyms, allowing models to be trained on their full form representations. Moreover, we incorporate consistency training to regularize predictions by enforcing agreement between the original and augmented documents. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-III dataset demonstrate that our approach, ACE-ICD establishes new state-of-the-art performance across multiple settings, including common codes, rare codes, and full-code assignments. Our code is publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出RLVE方法，使用可验证环境动态调整问题难度分布，通过RLVE-Gym套件中的400个环境进行训练，显著提升了语言模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决静态数据分布导致学习信号消失的问题，当问题对策略模型来说太容易或太难时，传统的强化学习效果会下降。

Method: 使用可验证环境，这些环境能够程序化生成问题并提供算法可验证的奖励，同时动态适应策略模型的能力调整问题难度分布。

Result: 在RLVE-Gym的400个环境中联合训练，相比原始RL训练，在六个推理基准上获得了3.37%的绝对平均提升，而原始方法仅获得0.49%的提升。

Conclusion: 环境扩展（增加训练环境数量）能够持续提升可泛化的推理能力，RLVE方法在计算效率上显著优于传统RL训练。

Abstract: We introduce Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Adaptive Verifiable Environments (RLVE), an approach using verifiable environments that procedurally generate problems and provide algorithmically verifiable rewards, to scale up RL for language models (LMs). RLVE enables each verifiable environment to dynamically adapt its problem difficulty distribution to the policy model's capabilities as training progresses. In contrast, static data distributions often lead to vanishing learning signals when problems are either too easy or too hard for the policy. To implement RLVE, we create RLVE-Gym, a large-scale suite of 400 verifiable environments carefully developed through manual environment engineering. Using RLVE-Gym, we show that environment scaling, i.e., expanding the collection of training environments, consistently improves generalizable reasoning capabilities. RLVE with joint training across all 400 environments in RLVE-Gym yields a 3.37% absolute average improvement across six reasoning benchmarks, starting from one of the strongest 1.5B reasoning LMs. By comparison, continuing this LM's original RL training yields only a 0.49% average absolute gain despite using over 3x more compute. We release our code publicly.

TL;DR: LLMs存在由伪相关性驱动的幻觉问题，这些幻觉基于训练数据中的表面统计关联，难以检测且不受模型扩展影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs取得显著进展，但仍存在生成看似合理但错误回答的幻觉问题，特别是由训练数据中伪相关性驱动的幻觉尚未被充分研究。

Method: 通过系统控制的合成实验和实证评估，测试了包括GPT-5在内的开源和专有LLMs，分析了现有幻觉检测方法的局限性。

Result: 现有幻觉检测方法（如基于置信度的过滤和内部状态探测）在面对伪相关性驱动的幻觉时基本失效，这些幻觉具有高置信度且难以检测。

Conclusion: 迫切需要开发专门针对伪相关性驱动幻觉的新方法，因为统计偏差从根本上削弱了基于置信度的检测技术。

Abstract: Despite substantial advances, large language models (LLMs) continue to exhibit hallucinations, generating plausible yet incorrect responses. In this paper, we highlight a critical yet previously underexplored class of hallucinations driven by spurious correlations -- superficial but statistically prominent associations between features (e.g., surnames) and attributes (e.g., nationality) present in the training data. We demonstrate that these spurious correlations induce hallucinations that are confidently generated, immune to model scaling, evade current detection methods, and persist even after refusal fine-tuning. Through systematically controlled synthetic experiments and empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LLMs (including GPT-5), we show that existing hallucination detection methods, such as confidence-based filtering and inner-state probing, fundamentally fail in the presence of spurious correlations. Our theoretical analysis further elucidates why these statistical biases intrinsically undermine confidence-based detection techniques. Our findings thus emphasize the urgent need for new approaches explicitly designed to address hallucinations caused by spurious correlations.

Abstract: While LLMs have shown great success in financial tasks like stock prediction and question answering, their application in fully automating Equity Research Report generation remains uncharted territory. In this paper, we formulate the Equity Research Report (ERR) Generation task for the first time. To address the data scarcity and the evaluation metrics absence, we present an open-source evaluation benchmark for ERR generation - FinRpt. We frame a Dataset Construction Pipeline that integrates 7 financial data types and produces a high-quality ERR dataset automatically, which could be used for model training and evaluation. We also introduce a comprehensive evaluation system including 11 metrics to assess the generated ERRs. Moreover, we propose a multi-agent framework specifically tailored to address this task, named FinRpt-Gen, and train several LLM-based agents on the proposed datasets using Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning. Experimental results indicate the data quality and metrics effectiveness of the benchmark FinRpt and the strong performance of FinRpt-Gen, showcasing their potential to drive innovation in the ERR generation field.

Motivation: LLM在低资源领域应用面临数据稀缺和过拟合风险，而大量通用领域数据可能作为辅助监督，但如何有效选择最有价值的辅助数据是关键问题。

Method: 提出NTK-Selector框架，通过经验证明LLM在LoRA微调中表现出稳定的类NTK行为，并提出无雅可比近似方法来解决计算成本问题。

Result: 在四个低资源领域实验中，使用NTK-Selector选择的9000个辅助样本使Llama3-8B-Instruct和Qwen3-8B分别获得+8.7和+5.1点的显著提升，相比仅使用1000个领域内样本的10.9倍和5.7倍改进。

Conclusion: NTK-Selector能够有效选择通用领域辅助数据，显著提升LLM在低资源领域的性能，为解决数据稀缺问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across widespread tasks, yet their application in low-resource domains remains a significant challenge due to data scarcity and the high risk of overfitting. While in-domain data is limited, there exist vast amounts of similar general-domain data, and our initial findings reveal that they could potentially serve as auxiliary supervision for domain enhancement. This observation leads us to our central research question: \textbf{\textit{how to effectively select the most valuable auxiliary data to maximize domain-specific performance}}, particularly when traditional methods are inapplicable due to a lack of large in-domain data pools or validation sets. To address this, we propose \textbf{NTK-Selector}, a principled and efficient framework for selecting general-domain auxiliary data to enhance domain-specific performance via neural tangent kernels (NTK). Our method tackles two challenges of directly applying NTK to LLMs, theoretical assumptions and prohibitive computational cost, by empirically demonstrating a stable NTK-like behavior in LLMs during LoRA fine-tuning and proposing a Jacobian-free approximation method. Extensive experiments across four low-resource domains (medical, financial, legal, and psychological) demonstrate that NTK-Selector consistently improves downstream performance. Specifically, fine-tuning on 1,000 in-domain samples alone only yielded +0.8 points for Llama3-8B-Instruct and +0.9 points for Qwen3-8B. In contrast, enriching with 9,000 auxiliary samples selected by NTK-Selector led to substantial \textbf{gains of +8.7 and +5.1 points}, which corresponds to a \textbf{10.9x and 5.7x improvement} over the domain-only setting.

Motivation: 解决低资源语言（如孟加拉语）在代码生成任务中代表性不足的问题，由于缺乏指令到代码的数据集和评估基准。

Method: 使用微调的Qwen2.5-14B模型，结合指令提示和测试驱动的反馈引导迭代优化过程，通过三轮评估对失败输出进行迭代改进。

Result: 在共享任务中获得第二名，Pass@1得分为0.934。

Conclusion: 分析突显了孟加拉语指令理解和Python代码生成的挑战，强调在低资源语言中需要有针对性的方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced the automated generation of code from natural language prompts. However, low-resource languages (LRLs) like Bangla remain underrepresented due to the limited availability of instruction-to-code datasets and evaluation benchmarks. To address this, the BLP Workshop at IJCNLP-AACL 2025 introduced a shared task on "Code Generation in Bangla". In this work, we propose a method that combines instruction prompting with a test-driven, feedback-guided iterative refinement process using a fine-tuned Qwen2.5-14B model. The model generates code from Bangla instructions, tests it against unit tests, and iteratively refines any failing outputs through three evaluation passes, using test feedback to guide each step. This approach helped our team "Retriv" to secure 2nd place in the shared task with a Pass@1 score of 0.934. The analysis highlights challenges in Bangla instruction understanding and Python code generation, emphasizing the need for targeted methods in LRLs. We made experimental scripts publicly available for the community.

Abstract: Recent advances in depth-recurrent language models show that recurrence can decouple train-time compute and parameter count from test-time compute. In this work, we study how to convert existing pretrained non-recurrent language models into depth-recurrent models. We find that using a curriculum of recurrences to increase the effective depth of the model over the course of training preserves performance while reducing total computational cost. In our experiments, on mathematics, we observe that converting pretrained models to recurrent ones results in better performance at a given compute budget than simply post-training the original non-recurrent language model.

Motivation: 在达芬奇机器人手术中，外科医生的手眼完全专注于手术过程，难以在不中断手术的情况下访问和操作多模态患者数据。

Method: 构建基于分层多智能体框架的语音导向手术协调平台，包含一个协调智能体和三个任务特定智能体，均由大语言模型驱动，能够自主规划、优化、验证和推理。

Result: SAOP在240个语音命令上实现了高准确率和成功率，LLM驱动的智能体提高了对语音识别错误和多样化自由形式命令的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该系统展示了支持微创达芬奇机器人手术的强大潜力，能够有效解决外科医生在手术过程中访问多模态数据的挑战。

Abstract: In da Vinci robotic surgery, surgeons' hands and eyes are fully engaged in the procedure, making it difficult to access and manipulate multimodal patient data without interruption. We propose a voice-directed Surgical Agent Orchestrator Platform (SAOP) built on a hierarchical multi-agent framework, consisting of an orchestration agent and three task-specific agents driven by Large Language Models (LLMs). These LLM-based agents autonomously plan, refine, validate, and reason to map voice commands into specific tasks such as retrieving clinical information, manipulating CT scans, or navigating 3D anatomical models on the surgical video. We also introduce a Multi-level Orchestration Evaluation Metric (MOEM) to comprehensively assess the performance and robustness from command-level and category-level perspectives. The SAOP achieves high accuracy and success rates across 240 voice commands, while LLM-based agents improve robustness against speech recognition errors and diverse or ambiguous free-form commands, demonstrating strong potential to support minimally invasive da Vinci robotic surgery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于大模型的对话语音代理部署难题：云端模型推理深度但延迟高，设备端模型响应快但能力有限。

Method: 提出对话填充任务，开发ConvFill模型（360M参数），在合成多领域对话数据上训练，实现设备端模型与云端模型的协同工作。

Result: ConvFill相比同规模独立小模型准确率提升36-42%，响应延迟始终低于200ms，在多个后端模型上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 对话填充方法有望构建既响应迅速又知识丰富的设备端对话代理，成功解耦了响应延迟与模型能力。

Abstract: Deploying conversational voice agents with large language models faces a critical challenge: cloud-based foundation models provide deep reasoning and domain knowledge but introduce latency that disrupts natural conversation, while on-device models respond immediately but lack sophistication. We propose conversational infill, a task where a lightweight on-device model generates contextually appropriate dialogue while seamlessly incorporating streaming knowledge from a powerful backend model. This approach decouples response latency from model capability, enabling systems that feel responsive while accessing the full power of large-scale models. We present ConvFill, a 360M parameter model trained on synthetic multi-domain conversations. Evaluation across multiple backend models shows that conversational infill can be successfully learned, with ConvFill achieving accuracy improvements of 36-42% over standalone small models of the same size while consistently retaining sub-200ms response latencies. Our results demonstrate the promise of this approach for building on-device conversational agents that are both immediately responsive and knowledgeable.

Motivation: 将社会学中的停止点概念转化为NLP任务，这些是普通的关键干预措施，通过讽刺、微妙怀疑或片段化论点等方式暂停或重定向在线讨论，而反言论或社会矫正框架常常忽视这些形式。

Method: 构建包含43,305条手动标注法语Facebook评论的语料库，包含上下文元数据。基准测试包括微调编码器模型(CamemBERT)和指令调优LLM的各种提示策略。

Result: 微调编码器模型在F1分数上显著优于提示LLM（超过10个百分点），上下文元数据将编码器模型的F1分数从0.75提升至0.78。

Conclusion: 监督学习对于新兴的非英语社交媒体任务至关重要，上下文元数据能进一步提升性能。发布了匿名数据集、标注指南和代码以促进透明度和可复现研究。

Abstract: We introduce SPOT (Stopping Points in Online Threads), the first annotated corpus translating the sociological concept of stopping point into a reproducible NLP task. Stopping points are ordinary critical interventions that pause or redirect online discussions through a range of forms (irony, subtle doubt or fragmentary arguments) that frameworks like counterspeech or social correction often overlook. We operationalize this concept as a binary classification task and provide reliable annotation guidelines. The corpus contains 43,305 manually annotated French Facebook comments linked to URLs flagged as false information by social media users, enriched with contextual metadata (article, post, parent comment, page or group, and source). We benchmark fine-tuned encoder models (CamemBERT) and instruction-tuned LLMs under various prompting strategies. Results show that fine-tuned encoders outperform prompted LLMs in F1 score by more than 10 percentage points, confirming the importance of supervised learning for emerging non-English social media tasks. Incorporating contextual metadata further improves encoder models F1 scores from 0.75 to 0.78. We release the anonymized dataset, along with the annotation guidelines and code in our code repository, to foster transparency and reproducible research.

### [318] [Evidence-Bound Autonomous Research (EviBound): A Governance Framework for Eliminating False Claims](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05524)
*Ruiying Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EviBound是一个证据约束的执行框架，通过双重治理门消除LLM自主研究代理的错误声明。该框架要求机器可检查的证据，在预执行和后执行阶段分别进行验证，确保只有有证据支持的声明才能传播。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM自主研究代理经常报告虚假声明，即使缺少工件、存在矛盾指标或执行失败，仍标记任务为"完成"。这损害了研究完整性，需要系统性的解决方案。

Method: 采用双重治理门：预执行批准门验证接受标准模式，后执行验证门通过MLflow API查询验证工件和指标。声明传播需要可查询的运行ID、必需工件和FINISHED状态。

Result: 在8个基准任务评估中，基线A产生100%幻觉率，基线B降至25%，而EviBound实现0%幻觉率：7/8任务验证通过，1个任务在批准门正确阻止，仅增加约8.3%执行开销。

Conclusion: 研究完整性是架构属性，通过治理门而非模型规模实现。证据约束的执行框架能有效消除LLM自主研究代理的虚假声明问题。

Abstract: LLM-based autonomous research agents report false claims: tasks marked "complete" despite missing artifacts, contradictory metrics, or failed executions. EviBound is an evidence-bound execution framework that eliminates false claims through dual governance gates requiring machine-checkable evidence.
  Two complementary gates enforce evidence requirements. The pre-execution Approval Gate validates acceptance criteria schemas before code runs, catching structural violations proactively. The post-execution Verification Gate validates artifacts via MLflow API queries (with recursive path checking) and optionally validates metrics when specified by acceptance criteria. Claims propagate only when backed by a queryable run ID, required artifacts, and FINISHED status. Bounded, confidence-gated retries (typically 1-2 attempts) recover from transient failures without unbounded loops.
  The framework was evaluated on 8 benchmark tasks spanning infrastructure validation, ML capabilities, and governance stress tests. Baseline A (Prompt-Level Only) yields 100% hallucination (8/8 claimed, 0/8 verified). Baseline B (Verification-Only) reduces hallucination to 25% (2/8 fail verification). EviBound (Dual Gates) achieves 0% hallucination: 7/8 tasks verified and 1 task correctly blocked at the approval gate, all with only approximately 8.3% execution overhead.
  This package includes execution trajectories, MLflow run IDs for all verified tasks, and a 4-step verification protocol. Research integrity is an architectural property, achieved through governance gates rather than emergent from model scale.

Motivation: LLM的快速扩张带来了前所未有的能源需求，推理工作负载往往主导整个生命周期消耗，但系统性的推理能耗分析仍然有限

Method: 使用vLLM推理引擎，在提示级别量化能耗，识别架构和操作因素如何影响能源需求，基于这些洞察开发预测模型

Result: 开发了能够准确估算未见架构和硬件上推理能耗的预测模型

Conclusion: 实现了浏览器扩展来提高对生成式AI环境影响的认知

Abstract: The rapid expansion of Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced unprecedented energy demands, extending beyond training to large-scale inference workloads that often dominate total lifecycle consumption. Deploying these models requires energy-intensive GPU infrastructure, and in some cases has even prompted plans to power data centers with nuclear energy. Despite this growing relevance, systematic analyses of inference energy consumption remain limited. In this work, we present a large-scale measurement-based study comprising over 32,500 measurements across 21 GPU configurations and 155 model architectures, from small open-source models to frontier systems. Using the vLLM inference engine, we quantify energy usage at the prompt level and identify how architectural and operational factors shape energy demand. Building on these insights, we develop a predictive model that accurately estimates inference energy consumption across unseen architectures and hardware, and implement it as a browser extension to raise awareness of the environmental impact of generative AI.

Motivation: CoT推理增强了LLMs的问题解决能力，但导致显著的推理开销，限制了在资源受限环境中的部署。需要研究高效的CoT跨模型迁移方法。

Method: 自适应推理摘要框架，包括语义分割与重要性评分、预算感知动态压缩、连贯性重建，以及基于高斯过程的贝叶斯优化模块来降低评估成本。

Result: 在7,501个医学考试问题上，相同token预算下比截断方法准确率高40%；在8个LLMs（1.5B-32B参数）的64个模型对上验证了强跨模型可迁移性；评估成本降低84%。

Conclusion: 推理摘要为实现高效CoT迁移提供了实用路径，能够在严格计算约束下实现高级推理能力。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enhances the problem-solving ability of large language models (LLMs) but leads to substantial inference overhead, limiting deployment in resource-constrained settings. This paper investigates efficient CoT transfer across models of different scales and architectures through an adaptive reasoning summarization framework. The proposed method compresses reasoning traces via semantic segmentation with importance scoring, budget-aware dynamic compression, and coherence reconstruction, preserving critical reasoning steps while significantly reducing token usage. Experiments on 7{,}501 medical examination questions across 10 specialties show up to 40% higher accuracy than truncation under the same token budgets. Evaluations on 64 model pairs from eight LLMs (1.5B-32B parameters, including DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3) confirm strong cross-model transferability. Furthermore, a Gaussian Process-based Bayesian optimization module reduces evaluation cost by 84% and reveals a power-law relationship between model size and cross-domain robustness. These results demonstrate that reasoning summarization provides a practical path toward efficient CoT transfer, enabling advanced reasoning under tight computational constraints. Code will be released upon publication.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型中观察到的认知偏见是表面模仿还是深层次概率变化，锚定偏见作为经典的人类判断偏见提供了一个关键测试案例。

Method: 使用对数概率行为分析、精确Shapley值归因和统一的锚定偏见敏感度评分，在六个开源模型上进行测试。

Result: Gemma-2B、Phi-2和Llama-2-7B显示出稳健的锚定效应，而GPT-2、Falcon-RW-1B和GPT-Neo-125M等较小模型表现可变，表明规模可能调节敏感性。

Conclusion: LLM中的锚定偏见是稳健、可测量和可解释的，但归因效应随提示设计而变化，凸显了将LLM作为人类替代品的脆弱性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly examined as both behavioral subjects and decision systems, yet it remains unclear whether observed cognitive biases reflect surface imitation or deeper probability shifts. Anchoring bias, a classic human judgment bias, offers a critical test case. While prior work shows LLMs exhibit anchoring, most evidence relies on surface-level outputs, leaving internal mechanisms and attributional contributions unexplored. This paper advances the study of anchoring in LLMs through three contributions: (1) a log-probability-based behavioral analysis showing that anchors shift entire output distributions, with controls for training-data contamination; (2) exact Shapley-value attribution over structured prompt fields to quantify anchor influence on model log-probabilities; and (3) a unified Anchoring Bias Sensitivity Score integrating behavioral and attributional evidence across six open-source models. Results reveal robust anchoring effects in Gemma-2B, Phi-2, and Llama-2-7B, with attribution signaling that the anchors influence reweighting. Smaller models such as GPT-2, Falcon-RW-1B, and GPT-Neo-125M show variability, suggesting scale may modulate sensitivity. Attributional effects, however, vary across prompt designs, underscoring fragility in treating LLMs as human substitutes. The findings demonstrate that anchoring bias in LLMs is robust, measurable, and interpretable, while highlighting risks in applied domains. More broadly, the framework bridges behavioral science, LLM safety, and interpretability, offering a reproducible path for evaluating other cognitive biases in LLMs.

Motivation: 构建可信赖的临床AI系统需要不仅准确的预测，还需要透明、基于生物学的解释。

Method: 使用GP-unmix高斯过程分层模型从bulk和单细胞RNA-seq数据推断细胞类型特异性基因表达谱，结合eQTL分析的调控先验训练神经网络分类器，并引入LLM推理模块生成针对不同受众的诊断报告。

Conclusion: 当LLM作为后处理推理器而非端到端预测器使用时，可以在混合诊断流程中作为有效的沟通工具。

Abstract: Building trustworthy clinical AI systems requires not only accurate predictions but also transparent, biologically grounded explanations. We present \texttt{DiagnoLLM}, a hybrid framework that integrates Bayesian deconvolution, eQTL-guided deep learning, and LLM-based narrative generation for interpretable disease diagnosis. DiagnoLLM begins with GP-unmix, a Gaussian Process-based hierarchical model that infers cell-type-specific gene expression profiles from bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data while modeling biological uncertainty. These features, combined with regulatory priors from eQTL analysis, power a neural classifier that achieves high predictive performance in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) detection (88.0\% accuracy). To support human understanding and trust, we introduce an LLM-based reasoning module that translates model outputs into audience-specific diagnostic reports, grounded in clinical features, attribution signals, and domain knowledge. Human evaluations confirm that these reports are accurate, actionable, and appropriately tailored for both physicians and patients. Our findings show that LLMs, when deployed as post-hoc reasoners rather than end-to-end predictors, can serve as effective communicators within hybrid diagnostic pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具增强的幻觉检测方法依赖预定义的固定验证策略，在动态变化环境中缺乏适应性，可能导致检测失败

Method: 将幻觉检测建模为动态策略学习问题，使用教师模型生成轨迹并动态调整策略，通过代理调优将动态规划能力蒸馏到学生模型，并采用主动修正机制

Result: 在三个挑战性基准测试中，LEAP调优的模型优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: LEAP框架成功解决了幻觉检测中的策略适应性问题，为LLM安全部署提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) remains a critical barrier to their safe deployment. Existing tool-augmented hallucination detection methods require pre-defined fixed verification strategies, which are crucial to the quality and effectiveness of tool calls. Some methods directly employ powerful closed-source LLMs such as GPT-4 as detectors, which are effective but too costly. To mitigate the cost issue, some methods adopt the teacher-student architecture and finetune open-source small models as detectors via agent tuning. However, these methods are limited by fixed strategies. When faced with a dynamically changing execution environment, they may lack adaptability and inappropriately call tools, ultimately leading to detection failure. To address the problem of insufficient strategy adaptability, we propose the innovative ``Learning to Evaluate and Adaptively Plan''(LEAP) framework, which endows an efficient student model with the dynamic learning and proactive correction capabilities of the teacher model. Specifically, our method formulates the hallucination detection problem as a dynamic strategy learning problem. We first employ a teacher model to generate trajectories within the dynamic learning loop and dynamically adjust the strategy based on execution failures. We then distill this dynamic planning capability into an efficient student model via agent tuning. Finally, during strategy execution, the student model adopts a proactive correction mechanism, enabling it to propose, review, and optimize its own verification strategies before execution. We demonstrate through experiments on three challenging benchmarks that our LEAP-tuned model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 虽然思维链推理能提高代码生成的透明度和准确性，但其推理质量尚未得到充分研究，需要系统评估推理LLM在代码生成中的表现。

Method: 使用BigCodeBench的100个代码生成任务评估6个推理LLM，通过步骤计数、冗长度量化、预算控制调整和21人参与的人工评估来分析推理链结构。

Result: 针对性增加步骤可提高某些模型/任务的解决率，但减少步骤在标准任务中通常能保持成功，在困难任务中很少成功。困难问题更容易出现不完整性错误。

Conclusion: 推理LLM在软件工程中具有逻辑一致性和自我纠错能力，但推理质量受任务复杂度显著影响，完整性是主要挑战。

Abstract: Thinking Large Language Models (LLMs) generate explicit intermediate reasoning traces before final answers, potentially improving transparency, interpretability, and solution accuracy for code generation. However, the quality of these reasoning chains remains underexplored. We present a comprehensive empirical study examining the reasoning process and quality of thinking LLMs for code generation. We evaluate six state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs (DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI-o3-mini, Claude-3.7-Sonnet-Thinking, Gemini-2.0-Flash-Thinking, Gemini-2.5-Flash, and Qwen-QwQ) across 100 code generation tasks of varying difficulty from BigCodeBench. We quantify reasoning-chain structure through step counts and verbosity, conduct controlled step-budget adjustments, and perform a 21-participant human evaluation across three dimensions: efficiency, logical correctness, and completeness. Our step-count interventions reveal that targeted step increases can improve resolution rates for certain models/tasks, while modest reductions often preserve success on standard tasks, rarely on hard ones. Through systematic analysis, we develop a reasoning-problematic taxonomy, identifying completeness as the dominant failure mode. Task complexity significantly impacts reasoning quality; hard problems are substantially more prone to incompleteness than standard tasks. Our stability analysis demonstrates that thinking LLMs maintain consistent logical structures across computational effort levels and can self-correct previous errors. This study provides new insights into the strengths and limitations of current thinking LLMs in software engineering.

Result: 实验发现三个重要发现：1) 多视图集成对可靠自动分析至关重要；2) 自动分析易受检测器诱导波动影响；3) 不同视图在平衡样本上一致性高，在偏见样本上分歧大。

Conclusion: 研究为多模态偏见识别提供了样本层面的自动化分析方法，揭示了多视图集成的重要性，为未来研究方向提供了潜在指导。

Abstract: Numerous multimodal misinformation benchmarks exhibit bias toward specific modalities, allowing detectors to make predictions based solely on one modality. While previous research has quantified bias at the dataset level or manually identified spurious correlations between modalities and labels, these approaches lack meaningful insights at the sample level and struggle to scale to the vast amount of online information. In this paper, we investigate the design for automated recognition of modality bias at the sample level. Specifically, we propose three bias quantification methods based on theories/views of different levels of granularity: 1) a coarse-grained evaluation of modality benefit; 2) a medium-grained quantification of information flow; and 3) a fine-grained causality analysis. To verify the effectiveness, we conduct a human evaluation on two popular benchmarks. Experimental results reveal three interesting findings that provide potential direction toward future research: 1)~Ensembling multiple views is crucial for reliable automated analysis; 2)~Automated analysis is prone to detector-induced fluctuations; and 3)~Different views produce a higher agreement on modality-balanced samples but diverge on biased ones.

Motivation: 现有LLM智能体通常在静态执行框架中运行，缺乏从自身经验和历史执行中学习改进的机制，性能受限于初始框架设计和底层LLM能力

Method: SAGE框架：智能体从初始执行中归纳出简洁的计划抽象，提炼关键步骤、依赖关系和约束条件，然后将学习到的抽象作为上下文指导反馈，改进智能体策略

Result: 在多样化LLM骨干和智能体架构上实现一致性能提升，与Mini-SWE-Agent基线相比获得7.2%相对性能改进，在SWE-Bench Verified基准测试中分别达到73.2%和74%的Pass@1解决率

Conclusion: SAGE框架通过自我抽象学习机制有效提升了LLM智能体在软件工程任务中的性能，证明了从经验中学习的重要性

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) based agents are increasingly used to tackle software engineering tasks that require multi-step reasoning and code modification, demonstrating promising yet limited performance. However, most existing LLM agents typically operate within static execution frameworks, lacking a principled mechanism to learn and self-improve from their own experience and past rollouts. As a result, their performance remains bounded by the initial framework design and the underlying LLM's capabilities. We propose Self-Abstraction from Grounded Experience (SAGE), a framework that enables agents to learn from their own task executions and refine their behavior through self-abstraction. After an initial rollout, the agent induces a concise plan abstraction from its grounded experience, distilling key steps, dependencies, and constraints. This learned abstraction is then fed back as contextual guidance, refining the agent's policy and supporting more structured, informed subsequent executions. Empirically, SAGE delivers consistent performance gains across diverse LLM backbones and agent architectures. Notably, it yields a 7.2% relative performance improvement over the strong Mini-SWE-Agent baseline when paired with the GPT-5 (high) backbone. SAGE further achieves strong overall performance on SWE-Bench Verified benchmark, reaching 73.2% and 74% Pass@1 resolve rates with the Mini-SWE-Agent and OpenHands CodeAct agent framework, respectively.

It distinguishes the de re and de dicto forms of such knowledge. The work introduces two modalities capturing these forms and formally specifies their meaning using a version of 2D-semantics. The main technical result is a sound and complete logical system describing the interplay between the two proposed modalities and the standard "knowledge of the fact" modality.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出ScRPO框架，通过自我反思和纠错增强大语言模型在数学问题上的表现，包含试错学习和自我纠正两个阶段，在多个数学推理基准测试中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在复杂数学问题上表现不佳的问题，通过自我反思机制让模型能够从错误中学习，减少对外部反馈的依赖。

Method: 两阶段方法：1) 试错学习阶段使用GRPO训练并收集错误答案；2) 自我纠正学习阶段指导模型反思先前错误答案的原因。

Result: 在AIME、AMC、Olympiad、MATH-500、GSM8k等多个数学基准测试中，ScRPO持续优于多种后训练方法。

Conclusion: ScRPO为语言模型在有限外部反馈下实现自我改进提供了有前景的范式，有助于构建更可靠和强大的AI系统。

Abstract: We propose Self-correction Relative Policy Optimization (ScRPO), a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance large language models on challenging mathematical problems by leveraging self-reflection and error correction. Our approach consists of two stages: (1) Trial-and-error learning stage: training the model with GRPO and collecting incorrect answers along with their corresponding questions in an error pool; (2) Self-correction learning stage: guiding the model to reflect on why its previous answers were wrong. Extensive experiments across multiple math reasoning benchmarks, including AIME, AMC, Olympiad, MATH-500, GSM8k, using Deepseek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and Deepseek-Distill-Qwen-7B. The experimental results demonstrate that ScRPO consistently outperforms several post-training methods. These findings highlight ScRPO as a promising paradigm for enabling language models to self-improve on difficult tasks with limited external feedback, paving the way toward more reliable and capable AI systems.

Conclusion: 通过结构化解耦探索与合成模式，结合CLPO的强化学习目标，能够有效解决多智能体系统的核心认知张力问题

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) built on Large Language Models (LLMs) are being used to approach complex problems and can surpass single model inference. However, their success hinges on navigating a fundamental cognitive tension: the need to balance broad, divergent exploration of the solution space with a principled, convergent synthesis to the optimal solution. Existing paradigms often struggle to manage this duality, leading to premature consensus, error propagation, and a critical credit assignment problem that fails to distinguish between genuine reasoning and superficially plausible arguments. To resolve this core challenge, we propose the Multi-Agent Exploration-Synthesis framework Through Role Orchestration (Maestro), a principled paradigm for collaboration that structurally decouples these cognitive modes. Maestro uses a collective of parallel Execution Agents for diverse exploration and a specialized Central Agent for convergent, evaluative synthesis. To operationalize this critical synthesis phase, we introduce Conditional Listwise Policy Optimization (CLPO), a reinforcement learning objective that disentangles signals for strategic decisions and tactical rationales. By combining decision-focused policy gradients with a list-wise ranking loss over justifications, CLPO achieves clean credit assignment and stronger comparative supervision. Experiments on mathematical reasoning and general problem-solving benchmarks demonstrate that Maestro, coupled with CLPO, consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art multi-agent approaches, delivering absolute accuracy gains of 6% on average and up to 10% at best.

TL;DR: DLPWM是一种无监督的、解耦的以对象为中心的世界模型，能够从像素中学习对象级潜在表示。虽然该模型在重建和预测方面表现良好，但在下游基于模型的强化学习任务中，其策略性能不如DreamerV3，主要原因是多对象交互过程中的表示漂移问题。

Motivation: 研究假设显式解耦的对象级表示能够通过定位任务相关信息来增强策略在新特征组合上的性能，从而改善强化学习中的组合泛化能力和数据效率。

Method: 提出了DLPWM，一种完全无监督、解耦的以对象为中心的世界模型，直接从像素学习对象级潜在表示。

Result: DLPWM在重建和预测方面表现强劲，对多种分布外视觉变化具有鲁棒性。但在下游模型控制任务中，基于DLPWM潜在表示的策略性能不如DreamerV3。潜在轨迹分析揭示了多对象交互过程中的表示漂移是导致策略学习不稳定的关键因素。

Conclusion: 虽然以对象为中心的感知支持鲁棒的视觉建模，但要实现稳定的控制需要缓解潜在漂移问题。

Abstract: Object-centric world models (OCWM) aim to decompose visual scenes into object-level representations, providing structured abstractions that could improve compositional generalization and data efficiency in reinforcement learning. We hypothesize that explicitly disentangled object-level representations, by localizing task-relevant information, can enhance policy performance across novel feature combinations. To test this hypothesis, we introduce DLPWM, a fully unsupervised, disentangled object-centric world model that learns object-level latents directly from pixels. DLPWM achieves strong reconstruction and prediction performance, including robustness to several out-of-distribution (OOD) visual variations. However, when used for downstream model-based control, policies trained on DLPWM latents underperform compared to DreamerV3. Through latent-trajectory analyses, we identify representation shift during multi-object interactions as a key driver of unstable policy learning. Our results suggest that, although object-centric perception supports robust visual modeling, achieving stable control requires mitigating latent drift.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体规划中，MCTS面临组合动作空间的指数级增长，导致树扩展的分支因子急剧增加，难以高效进行探索和利用。

Method: 提出MALinZero方法，将联合动作回报投影到低维空间，使用上下文线性老虎机问题公式化，通过凸和μ-平滑损失函数解决该问题，并推导出线性上置信界应用于树(LinUCT)。

Result: MALinZero在矩阵游戏、SMAC和SMACv2等多智能体基准测试中表现出最先进的性能，优于基于模型和无模型的多智能体强化学习基线，具有更快的学习速度和更好的性能。

Conclusion: MALinZero通过低维表示结构有效解决了多智能体MCTS中的组合动作空间问题，实现了高效的多智能体探索和利用。

Abstract: Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), which leverages Upper Confidence Bound for Trees (UCTs) to balance exploration and exploitation through randomized sampling, is instrumental to solving complex planning problems. However, for multi-agent planning, MCTS is confronted with a large combinatorial action space that often grows exponentially with the number of agents. As a result, the branching factor of MCTS during tree expansion also increases exponentially, making it very difficult to efficiently explore and exploit during tree search. To this end, we propose MALinZero, a new approach to leverage low-dimensional representational structures on joint-action returns and enable efficient MCTS in complex multi-agent planning. Our solution can be viewed as projecting the joint-action returns into the low-dimensional space representable using a contextual linear bandit problem formulation. We solve the contextual linear bandit problem with convex and $μ$-smooth loss functions -- in order to place more importance on better joint actions and mitigate potential representational limitations -- and derive a linear Upper Confidence Bound applied to trees (LinUCT) to enable novel multi-agent exploration and exploitation in the low-dimensional space. We analyze the regret of MALinZero for low-dimensional reward functions and propose an $(1-\tfrac1e)$-approximation algorithm for the joint action selection by maximizing a sub-modular objective. MALinZero demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multi-agent benchmarks such as matrix games, SMAC, and SMACv2, outperforming both model-based and model-free multi-agent reinforcement learning baselines with faster learning speed and better performance.

TL;DR: PRIME是一个新的评估框架，使用逻辑网格谜题来系统性地探测LLMs中社会刻板印象对逻辑推理和决策的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的安全护栏能有效抑制明显的偏见输出，但在复杂逻辑推理任务中更微妙的社会偏见形式会显现，而现有评估基准无法检测到这些偏见。

Method: 使用逻辑网格谜题自动生成和验证，创建刻板印象、反刻板印象和中性的谜题变体，评估多个模型家族在不同谜题大小下的表现，并测试基于提示的缓解策略的有效性。

Result: 模型在解决方案与刻板印象关联一致时推理更准确，表明刻板印象显著影响LLMs的演绎推理。

Conclusion: PRIME对于诊断和量化LLMs演绎推理中持续存在的社会偏见具有重要意义，特别是在公平性至关重要的场景中。

Abstract: While recent safety guardrails effectively suppress overtly biased outputs, subtler forms of social bias emerge during complex logical reasoning tasks that evade current evaluation benchmarks. To fill this gap, we introduce a new evaluation framework, PRIME (Puzzle Reasoning for Implicit Biases in Model Evaluation), that uses logic grid puzzles to systematically probe the influence of social stereotypes on logical reasoning and decision making in LLMs. Our use of logic puzzles enables automatic generation and verification, as well as variability in complexity and biased settings. PRIME includes stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, and neutral puzzle variants generated from a shared puzzle structure, allowing for controlled and fine-grained comparisons. We evaluate multiple model families across puzzle sizes and test the effectiveness of prompt-based mitigation strategies. Focusing our experiments on gender stereotypes, our findings highlight that models consistently reason more accurately when solutions align with stereotypical associations. This demonstrates the significance of PRIME for diagnosing and quantifying social biases perpetuated in the deductive reasoning of LLMs, where fairness is critical.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在Chain-of-Thought推理中的一致性问题，量化模型生成推理链与人类参考链的语义对齐程度，并优化推理一致性。

Method: 提出Alignment Score指标评估推理一致性，定义四种错误类型，并提出Semantic Consistency Optimization Sampling (SCOS)方法，通过采样对齐错误最小的推理链来优化推理一致性。

Result: 实证发现2跳推理链对齐度最高，SCOS方法在3跳任务中将Alignment Score平均提升29.84%。

Conclusion: 该框架有效评估和优化大语言模型的推理一致性，SCOS方法显著提升长推理链的语义对齐度。

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for evaluating and optimizing reasoning consistency in Large Language Models (LLMs) via a new metric, the Alignment Score, which quantifies the semantic alignment between model-generated reasoning chains and human-written reference chains in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. Empirically, we find that 2-hop reasoning chains achieve the highest Alignment Score. To explain this phenomenon, we define four key error types: logical disconnection, thematic shift, redundant reasoning, and causal reversal, and show how each contributes to the degradation of the Alignment Score. Building on this analysis, we further propose Semantic Consistency Optimization Sampling (SCOS), a method that samples and favors chains with minimal alignment errors, significantly improving Alignment Scores by an average of 29.84% with longer reasoning chains, such as in 3-hop tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CSP4SDG是一个基于约束满足的概率推理框架，用于社交推理游戏中隐藏角色推断，通过硬约束和软约束分析游戏事件和对话，在多个数据集上优于LLM基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交推理游戏中玩家隐藏身份并故意误导他人，准确的角色识别是游戏表现的关键，但现有方法在处理这类复杂推理任务时存在局限。

Method: 将游戏事件和对话映射到四个语言无关的约束类别（证据、现象、断言、假设），使用硬约束修剪不可能的角色分配，加权软约束对剩余分配评分，信息增益权重将每个假设与其在熵减少下的期望值关联。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上的实验表明，CSP4SDG在所有推理场景中都优于基于LLM的基线模型，并且当作为辅助"推理工具"提供时能提升LLM性能。

Conclusion: 基于信息理论的原则性概率推理是社交推理游戏中重量级神经模型的可扩展替代或补充方案。

Abstract: In Social Deduction Games (SDGs) such as Avalon, Mafia, and Werewolf, players conceal their identities and deliberately mislead others, making hidden-role inference a central and demanding task. Accurate role identification, which forms the basis of an agent's belief state, is therefore the keystone for both human and AI performance. We introduce CSP4SDG, a probabilistic, constraint-satisfaction framework that analyses gameplay objectively. Game events and dialogue are mapped to four linguistically-agnostic constraint classes-evidence, phenomena, assertions, and hypotheses. Hard constraints prune impossible role assignments, while weighted soft constraints score the remainder; information-gain weighting links each hypothesis to its expected value under entropy reduction, and a simple closed-form scoring rule guarantees that truthful assertions converge to classical hard logic with minimum error. The resulting posterior over roles is fully interpretable and updates in real time. Experiments on three public datasets show that CSP4SDG (i) outperforms LLM-based baselines in every inference scenario, and (ii) boosts LLMs when supplied as an auxiliary "reasoning tool." Our study validates that principled probabilistic reasoning with information theory is a scalable alternative-or complement-to heavy-weight neural models for SDGs.

Abstract: The growing demand for AI applications in fields such as materials discovery, molecular modeling, and climate science has made data preparation an important but labor-intensive step. Raw data from diverse sources must be cleaned, normalized, and transformed to become AI-ready, while effective feature transformation and selection are essential for efficient training and inference. To address the challenges of scalability and expertise dependence, we present Data Agent, a fully autonomous system specialized for tabular data. Leveraging large language model (LLM) reasoning and grounded validation, Data Agent automatically performs data cleaning, hierarchical routing, and feature-level optimization through dual feedback loops. It embodies three core principles: automatic, safe, and non-expert friendly, which ensure end-to-end reliability without human supervision. This demo showcases the first practical realization of an autonomous Data Agent, illustrating how raw data can be transformed "From Data to Better Data."

<details>

Motivation: 现有推理验证方法（如过程奖励模型PRMs）计算成本高、领域受限或需要大规模人工标注，需要更轻量、通用的验证方案

Method: 训练基于Transformer的不确定性量化头（UHeads），利用冻结LLM的内部状态来估计推理步骤的不确定性，标签由更大LLM或原模型自监督生成

Result: UHeads仅含不到1000万参数，在数学、规划和常识问答等多个领域，性能达到或超过比其大810倍的PRMs

Conclusion: LLM内部状态编码了其不确定性，可作为推理验证的可靠信号，为可扩展和泛化的自省LLMs提供了有前景的方向

Abstract: Solving complex tasks usually requires LLMs to generate long multi-step reasoning chains. Previous work has shown that verifying the correctness of individual reasoning steps can further improve the performance and efficiency of LLMs on such tasks and enhance solution interpretability. However, existing verification approaches, such as Process Reward Models (PRMs), are either computationally expensive, limited to specific domains, or require large-scale human or model-generated annotations. Thus, we propose a lightweight alternative for step-level reasoning verification based on data-driven uncertainty scores. We train transformer-based uncertainty quantification heads (UHeads) that use the internal states of a frozen LLM to estimate the uncertainty of its reasoning steps during generation. The approach is fully automatic: target labels are generated either by another larger LLM (e.g., DeepSeek R1) or in a self-supervised manner by the original model itself. UHeads are both effective and lightweight, containing less than 10M parameters. Across multiple domains, including mathematics, planning, and general knowledge question answering, they match or even surpass the performance of PRMs that are up to 810x larger. Our findings suggest that the internal states of LLMs encode their uncertainty and can serve as reliable signals for reasoning verification, offering a promising direction toward scalable and generalizable introspective LLMs.

Conclusion: 小模型通过创新的训练方法可以实现与大模型相当的推理能力，这大大降低了训练和推理成本，为AI研究的民主化开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Challenging the prevailing consensus that small models inherently lack robust reasoning, this report introduces VibeThinker-1.5B, a 1.5B-parameter dense model developed via our Spectrum-to-Signal Principle (SSP). This challenges the prevailing approach of scaling model parameters to enhance capabilities, as seen in models like DeepSeek R1 (671B) and Kimi k2 (>1T). The SSP framework first employs a Two-Stage Diversity-Exploring Distillation (SFT) to generate a broad spectrum of solutions, followed by MaxEnt-Guided Policy Optimization (RL) to amplify the correct signal. With a total training cost of only $7,800, VibeThinker-1.5B demonstrates superior reasoning capabilities compared to closed-source models like Magistral Medium and Claude Opus 4, and performs on par with open-source models like GPT OSS-20B Medium. Remarkably, it surpasses the 400x larger DeepSeek R1 on three math benchmarks: AIME24 (80.3 vs. 79.8), AIME25 (74.4 vs. 70.0), and HMMT25 (50.4 vs. 41.7). This is a substantial improvement over its base model (6.7, 4.3, and 0.6, respectively). On LiveCodeBench V6, it scores 51.1, outperforming Magistral Medium's 50.3 and its base model's 0.0. These findings demonstrate that small models can achieve reasoning capabilities comparable to large models, drastically reducing training and inference costs and thereby democratizing advanced AI research.

Conclusion: ROAR模型在复杂交通环境中展现出强大的鲁棒性，特别是在处理传感器退化、环境噪声和不平衡数据分布方面，为可靠准确的事故预测提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate accident anticipation is essential for enhancing the safety of autonomous vehicles (AVs). However, existing methods often assume ideal conditions, overlooking challenges such as sensor failures, environmental disturbances, and data imperfections, which can significantly degrade prediction accuracy. Additionally, previous models have not adequately addressed the considerable variability in driver behavior and accident rates across different vehicle types. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces ROAR, a novel approach for accident detection and prediction. ROAR combines Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), a self adaptive object aware module, and dynamic focal loss to tackle these challenges. The DWT effectively extracts features from noisy and incomplete data, while the object aware module improves accident prediction by focusing on high-risk vehicles and modeling the spatial temporal relationships among traffic agents. Moreover, dynamic focal loss mitigates the impact of class imbalance between positive and negative samples. Evaluated on three widely used datasets, Dashcam Accident Dataset (DAD), Car Crash Dataset (CCD), and AnAn Accident Detection (A3D), our model consistently outperforms existing baselines in key metrics such as Average Precision (AP) and mean Time to Accident (mTTA). These results demonstrate the model's robustness in real-world conditions, particularly in handling sensor degradation, environmental noise, and imbalanced data distributions. This work offers a promising solution for reliable and accurate accident anticipation in complex traffic environments.

Conclusion: GAIA通过连接理论与实践，为安全、高效和可问责的AI委托提供了可复现的规范，可应用于采购、房地产和人员配置等工作流程。

Abstract: Organizations are increasingly exploring delegation of screening and negotiation tasks to AI systems, yet deployment in high-stakes B2B settings is constrained by governance: preventing unauthorized commitments, ensuring sufficient information before bargaining, and maintaining effective human oversight and auditability. Prior work on large language model negotiation largely emphasizes autonomous bargaining between agents and omits practical needs such as staged information gathering, explicit authorization boundaries, and systematic feedback integration. We propose GAIA, a governance-first framework for LLM-human agency in B2B negotiation and screening. GAIA defines three essential roles - Principal (human), Delegate (LLM agent), and Counterparty - with an optional Critic to enhance performance, and organizes interactions through three mechanisms: information-gated progression that separates screening from negotiation; dual feedback integration that combines AI critique with lightweight human corrections; and authorization boundaries with explicit escalation paths. Our contributions are fourfold: (1) a formal governance framework with three coordinated mechanisms and four safety invariants for delegation with bounded authorization; (2) information-gated progression via task-completeness tracking (TCI) and explicit state transitions that separate screening from commitment; (3) dual feedback integration that blends Critic suggestions with human oversight through parallel learning channels; and (4) a hybrid validation blueprint that combines automated protocol metrics with human judgment of outcomes and safety. By bridging theory and practice, GAIA offers a reproducible specification for safe, efficient, and accountable AI delegation that can be instantiated across procurement, real estate, and staffing workflows.

Conclusion: 将合成数据生成融入提示学习对金融应用具有重要价值，能够在不依赖外部标签的情况下持续改进提示性能。

Abstract: Financial documents like earning reports or balance sheets often involve long tables and multi-page reports. Large language models have become a new tool to help numerical reasoning and understanding these documents. However, prompt quality can have a major effect on how well LLMs perform these financial reasoning tasks. Most current methods tune prompts on fixed datasets of financial text or tabular data, which limits their ability to adapt to new question types or document structures, or they involve costly and manually labeled/curated dataset to help build the prompts. We introduce a self-improving prompt framework driven by data-augmented optimization. In this closed-loop process, we generate synthetic financial tables and document excerpts, verify their correctness and robustness, and then update the prompt based on the results. Specifically, our framework combines a synthetic data generator with verifiers and a prompt optimizer, where the generator produces new examples that exposes weaknesses in the current prompt, the verifiers check the validity and robustness of the produced examples, and the optimizer incrementally refines the prompt in response. By iterating these steps in a feedback cycle, our method steadily improves prompt accuracy on financial reasoning tasks without needing external labels. Evaluation on DocMath-Eval benchmark demonstrates that our system achieves higher performance in both accuracy and robustness than standard prompt methods, underscoring the value of incorporating synthetic data generation into prompt learning for financial applications.

Abstract: Evaluating semantic tables interpretation (STI) systems, (particularly, those based on Large Language Models- LLMs) especially in domain-specific contexts such as the security domain, depends heavily on the dataset. However, in the security domain, tabular datasets for state-of-the-art are not publicly available. In this paper, we introduce Secu-Table dataset, composed of more than 1500 tables with more than 15k entities constructed using security data extracted from Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) and Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) data sources and annotated using Wikidata and the SEmantic Processing of Security Event Streams CyberSecurity Knowledge Graph (SEPSES CSKG). Along with the dataset, all the code is publicly released. This dataset is made available to the research community in the context of the SemTab challenge on Tabular to Knowledge Graph Matching. This challenge aims to evaluate the performance of several STI based on open source LLMs. Preliminary evaluation, serving as baseline, was conducted using Falcon3-7b-instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct, two open source LLMs and GPT-4o mini one closed source LLM.

*Stephen Chung,Wenyu Du*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STATION是一个开放世界多智能体环境，模拟微型科学生态系统。智能体可以进行长期科学探索，包括阅读同行论文、提出假设、提交代码、执行分析和发表成果，无需中央协调系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 创造一种超越刚性优化的新范式，通过开放世界环境中的涌现行为推动自主科学发现。

Method: 构建开放世界多智能体环境，智能体利用扩展上下文窗口进行长期科学探索，自由选择行动并发展自己的叙事。

Result: STATION中的AI智能体在数学、计算生物学和机器学习等广泛基准测试中达到新的最先进性能，特别是在圆包装问题上超越AlphaEvolve，并涌现出新的方法如scRNA-seq批次整合的密度自适应算法。

Conclusion: STATION代表了迈向由开放世界环境中涌现行为驱动的自主科学发现的第一步，超越了传统的优化范式。

Abstract: We introduce the STATION, an open-world multi-agent environment that models a miniature scientific ecosystem. Leveraging their extended context windows, agents in the Station can engage in long scientific journeys that include reading papers from peers, formulating hypotheses, submitting code, performing analyses, and publishing results. Importantly, there is no centralized system coordinating their activities - agents are free to choose their own actions and develop their own narratives within the Station. Experiments demonstrate that AI agents in the Station achieve new state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of benchmarks, spanning from mathematics to computational biology to machine learning, notably surpassing AlphaEvolve in circle packing. A rich tapestry of narratives emerges as agents pursue independent research, interact with peers, and build upon a cumulative history. From these emergent narratives, novel methods arise organically, such as a new density-adaptive algorithm for scRNA-seq batch integration. The Station marks a first step towards autonomous scientific discovery driven by emergent behavior in an open-world environment, representing a new paradigm that moves beyond rigid optimization.

*MD Thamed Bin Zaman Chowdhury,Moazzem Hossain*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ALIGN是一个视觉语言框架，通过模拟人类空间推理从文本和地图线索推断交通事故坐标，在孟加拉语新闻数据中相比传统地理编码方法有显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低收入和中等收入国家缺乏准确的位置特定交通事故数据，现有基于文本的地理编码工具在多语言和非结构化新闻环境中表现不佳，不完整的地点描述和混合的孟加拉语-英语脚本模糊了空间上下文。

Method: ALIGN将大型语言和视觉语言模型集成到多阶段管道中，执行光学字符识别、语言推理和通过基于网格的空间扫描进行地图级验证，系统评估每个预测位置与上下文和视觉证据。

Result: 应用于孟加拉语新闻数据，ALIGN相比传统地理解析方法显示出持续改进，准确识别地区和分区级别的碰撞地点。

Conclusion: 该框架为数据稀缺地区的自动碰撞映射建立了高精度基础，支持证据驱动的道路安全政策制定，以及多模态人工智能在交通分析中的更广泛集成。

Abstract: Reliable geospatial information on road accidents is vital for safety analysis and infrastructure planning, yet most low- and middle-income countries continue to face a critical shortage of accurate, location-specific crash data. Existing text-based geocoding tools perform poorly in multilingual and unstructured news environments, where incomplete place descriptions and mixed Bangla-English scripts obscure spatial context. To address these limitations, this study introduces ALIGN (Accident Location Inference through Geo-Spatial Neural Reasoning)- a vision-language framework that emulates human spatial reasoning to infer accident coordinates directly from textual and map-based cues. ALIGN integrates large language and vision-language models within a multi-stage pipeline that performs optical character recognition, linguistic reasoning, and map-level verification through grid-based spatial scanning. The framework systematically evaluates each predicted location against contextual and visual evidence, ensuring interpretable, fine-grained geolocation outcomes without requiring model retraining. Applied to Bangla-language news data, ALIGN demonstrates consistent improvements over traditional geoparsing methods, accurately identifying district and sub-district-level crash sites. Beyond its technical contribution, the framework establishes a high accuracy foundation for automated crash mapping in data-scarce regions, supporting evidence-driven road-safety policymaking and the broader integration of multimodal artificial intelligence in transportation analytics.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made rapid progress in reasoning, question answering, and professional applications; however, their true capabilities remain difficult to evaluate using existing benchmarks. Current datasets often focus on simplified tasks or artificial scenarios, overlooking long-tail knowledge and the complexities of real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we propose LPFQA, a long-tail knowledge-based benchmark derived from authentic professional forums across 20 academic and industrial fields, covering 502 tasks grounded in practical expertise. LPFQA introduces four key innovations: fine-grained evaluation dimensions that target knowledge depth, reasoning, terminology comprehension, and contextual analysis; a hierarchical difficulty structure that ensures semantic clarity and unique answers; authentic professional scenario modeling with realistic user personas; and interdisciplinary knowledge integration across diverse domains. We evaluated 12 mainstream LLMs on LPFQA and observed significant performance disparities, especially in specialized reasoning tasks. LPFQA provides a robust, authentic, and discriminative benchmark for advancing LLM evaluation and guiding future model development.

TL;DR: 论文提出AEPO方法解决LLMs在复杂领域推理中的"回声反射"问题，通过控制信息流和自适应熵优化来提升反思阶段的认知洞察力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在数学推理上表现良好，但在涉及复杂领域知识的任务中，LLMs在反思阶段无法产生新的认知洞察，而是机械重复早期推理步骤，出现"回声反射"现象。

Method: 提出自适应熵策略优化(AEPO)框架，包含两个组件：反思感知信息过滤(量化认知信息流，防止早期错误认知影响最终答案)和自适应熵优化(动态平衡不同推理阶段的探索与利用)。

Result: 大量实验表明AEPO在多种基准测试中始终优于主流强化学习基线方法，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: AEPO通过控制信息流和促进反思多样性，有效解决了LLMs在复杂领域推理中的认知局限问题，显著提升了模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of reasoning tasks. Recent methods have further improved LLM performance in complex mathematical reasoning. However, when extending these methods beyond the domain of mathematical reasoning to tasks involving complex domain-specific knowledge, we observe a consistent failure of LLMs to generate novel insights during the reflection stage. Instead of conducting genuine cognitive refinement, the model tends to mechanically reiterate earlier reasoning steps without introducing new information or perspectives, a phenomenon referred to as "Echo Reflection". We attribute this behavior to two key defects: (1) Uncontrollable information flow during response generation, which allows premature intermediate thoughts to propagate unchecked and distort final decisions; (2) Insufficient exploration of internal knowledge during reflection, leading to repeating earlier findings rather than generating new cognitive insights. Building on these findings, we proposed a novel reinforcement learning method termed Adaptive Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO). Specifically, the AEPO framework consists of two major components: (1) Reflection-aware Information Filtration, which quantifies the cognitive information flow and prevents the final answer from being affected by earlier bad cognitive information; (2) Adaptive-Entropy Optimization, which dynamically balances exploration and exploitation across different reasoning stages, promoting both reflective diversity and answer correctness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AEPO consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance over mainstream reinforcement learning baselines across diverse benchmarks.

Motivation: 当前依赖前沿模型进行LLM安全性评估成本高昂，限制了可扩展性，需要开发更经济高效的评估方法。

Method: 使用小型语言模型构建多智能体评判框架，包含批评者、辩护者和法官角色进行结构化辩论，并在HAJailBench基准上进行评估。

Result: 基于小型语言模型的框架在HAJailBench上达到了与GPT-4o相当的评判一致性，同时显著降低了推理成本，三回合辩论在准确性和效率之间达到最优平衡。

Conclusion: 结构化、价值对齐的辩论使小型语言模型能够捕捉越狱攻击的语义细微差别，HAJailBench为可扩展的LLM安全性评估提供了可靠基础。

Abstract: Safety evaluation of large language models (LLMs) increasingly relies on LLM-as-a-Judge frameworks, but the high cost of frontier models limits scalability. We propose a cost-efficient multi-agent judging framework that employs Small Language Models (SLMs) through structured debates among critic, defender, and judge agents. To rigorously assess safety judgments, we construct HAJailBench, a large-scale human-annotated jailbreak benchmark comprising 12,000 adversarial interactions across diverse attack methods and target models. The dataset provides fine-grained, expert-labeled ground truth for evaluating both safety robustness and judge reliability. Our SLM-based framework achieves agreement comparable to GPT-4o judges on HAJailBench while substantially reducing inference cost. Ablation results show that three rounds of debate yield the optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency. These findings demonstrate that structured, value-aligned debate enables SLMs to capture semantic nuances of jailbreak attacks and that HAJailBench offers a reliable foundation for scalable LLM safety evaluation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了SofT-GRPO算法，通过注入Gumbel噪声和使用Gumbel-Softmax技术来增强LLM的软思维推理模式，在多个基准测试中优于传统的离散token推理方法。


<details>

Motivation: 软思维推理模式在某些场景下优于传统的离散token链式思维推理，但难以通过强化学习进行优化。现有方法在结合软思维与GRPO时表现不佳，需要新的算法来充分释放软思维的潜力。

Method: 提出SofT-GRPO算法：向logits注入Gumbel噪声，使用Gumbel-Softmax技术避免软思维token超出预训练嵌入空间，并在策略梯度中利用重参数化技巧。

Result: 在1.5B到7B参数的LLM上实验，SofT-GRPO使软思维LLM在Pass@1上略优于离散token GRPO（平均准确率+0.13%），在Pass@32上显著提升（平均准确率+2.19%）。

Conclusion: SofT-GRPO成功解决了软思维推理与强化学习结合的挑战，为软思维推理的优化提供了有效方法，显著提升了LLM在复杂推理任务中的表现。

Abstract: The soft-thinking paradigm for Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning can outperform the conventional discrete-token Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in some scenarios, underscoring its research and application value. However, while the discrete-token CoT reasoning pattern can be reinforced through policy optimization algorithms such as group relative policy optimization (GRPO), extending the soft-thinking pattern with Reinforcement Learning (RL) remains challenging. This difficulty stems from the complexities of injecting stochasticity into soft-thinking tokens and updating soft-thinking policies accordingly. As a result, previous attempts to combine soft-thinking with GRPO typically underperform their discrete-token GRPO counterparts. To fully unlock the potential of soft-thinking, this paper presents a novel policy optimization algorithm, SofT-GRPO, to reinforce LLMs under the soft-thinking reasoning pattern. SofT-GRPO injects the Gumbel noise into logits, employs the Gumbel-Softmax technique to avoid soft-thinking tokens outside the pre-trained embedding space, and leverages the reparameterization trick in policy gradient. We conduct experiments across base LLMs ranging from 1.5B to 7B parameters, and results demonstrate that SofT-GRPO enables soft-thinking LLMs to slightly outperform discrete-token GRPO on Pass@1 (+0.13% on average accuracy), while exhibiting a substantial uplift on Pass@32 (+2.19% on average accuracy).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI数据收集方法主要依赖Common Crawl中的网页HTML，难以应用于桌面软件和新网站，而个性化场景需要模型能快速适应新软件或网站。

Method: 开发Auto-Explorer方法，包含简单有效的探索机制，自主解析和探索GUI环境；建立UIXplore基准评估探索质量；使用收集的数据微调多模态大语言模型。

Result: 实验证明Auto-Explorer表现出优越性能，能够快速提升MLLM在已探索软件中的能力。

Conclusion: Auto-Explorer提供了一种有效的低成本GUI数据收集解决方案，显著提升了模型在新软件环境中的适应能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in GUI agents have significantly expanded their ability to interpret natural language commands to manage software interfaces. However, acquiring GUI data remains a significant challenge. Existing methods often involve designing automated agents that browse URLs from the Common Crawl, using webpage HTML to collect screenshots and corresponding annotations, including the names and bounding boxes of UI elements. However, this method is difficult to apply to desktop software or some newly launched websites not included in the Common Crawl. While we expect the model to possess strong generalization capabilities to handle this, it is still crucial for personalized scenarios that require rapid and perfect adaptation to new software or websites. To address this, we propose an automated data collection method with minimal annotation costs, named Auto-Explorer. It incorporates a simple yet effective exploration mechanism that autonomously parses and explores GUI environments, gathering data efficiently. Additionally, to assess the quality of exploration, we have developed the UIXplore benchmark. This benchmark creates environments for explorer agents to discover and save software states. Using the data gathered, we fine-tune a multimodal large language model (MLLM) and establish a GUI element grounding testing set to evaluate the effectiveness of the exploration strategies. Our experiments demonstrate the superior performance of Auto-Explorer, showing that our method can quickly enhance the capabilities of an MLLM in explored software.

Motivation: 大型推理模型存在谄媚行为，倾向于同意用户的错误信念和追随错误信息，这损害了模型可靠性并带来社会风险。现有方法主要基于最终答案进行判断和修正，无法理解谄媚行为在推理过程中的发展。

Method: 提出MONICA框架，包含谄媚监控器和校准器。监控器在响应生成过程中实时监测谄媚漂移分数，校准器在分数超过预设阈值时动态抑制谄媚行为。

Result: 在12个数据集和3个大型推理模型上的广泛实验表明，该方法有效减少了中间推理步骤和最终答案中的谄媚行为，实现了稳健的性能提升。

Conclusion: MONICA框架能够在推理步骤层面有效监测和减轻模型的谄媚行为，提高模型的独立推理能力和可靠性。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) suffer from sycophantic behavior, where models tend to agree with users' incorrect beliefs and follow misinformation rather than maintain independent reasoning. This behavior undermines model reliability and poses societal risks. Mitigating LRM sycophancy requires monitoring how this sycophancy emerges during the reasoning trajectory; however, current methods mainly focus on judging based on final answers and correcting them, without understanding how sycophancy develops during reasoning processes. To address this limitation, we propose MONICA, a novel Monitor-guided Calibration framework that monitors and mitigates sycophancy during model inference at the level of reasoning steps, without requiring the model to finish generating its complete answer. MONICA integrates a sycophantic monitor that provides real-time monitoring of sycophantic drift scores during response generation with a calibrator that dynamically suppresses sycophantic behavior when scores exceed predefined thresholds. Extensive experiments across 12 datasets and 3 LRMs demonstrate that our method effectively reduces sycophantic behavior in both intermediate reasoning steps and final answers, yielding robust performance improvements.

Motivation: 现有方法在LLM置信度估计方面存在校准差和过度自信的问题，特别是在错误预测上，这阻碍了模型的安全部署。

Method: 将每个思维链视为高维空间中的向量，提取8个拓扑风险特征来捕捉推理分布的几何结构：紧密、连贯的簇表示高置信度，而分散、不一致的路径表示不确定性。

Result: 在四个推理基准测试中，EDTR比现有方法校准效果提升41%，平均ECE为0.287，综合得分0.672最佳，在AIME上达到完美准确率，在GSM8K上ECE为0.107。

Conclusion: 为理解和量化多步LLM推理中的不确定性提供了一个几何框架，在需要校准置信度估计的场景中实现了更可靠的部署。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting enables Large Language Models to solve complex problems, but deploying these models safely requires reliable confidence estimates, a capability where existing methods suffer from poor calibration and severe overconfidence on incorrect predictions. We propose Enhanced Dirichlet and Topology Risk (EDTR), a novel decoding strategy that combines topological analysis with Dirichlet-based uncertainty quantification to measure LLM confidence across multiple reasoning paths. EDTR treats each CoT as a vector in high-dimensional space and extracts eight topological risk features capturing the geometric structure of reasoning distributions: tighter, more coherent clusters indicate higher confidence while dispersed, inconsistent paths signal uncertainty. We evaluate EDTR against three state-of-the-art calibration methods across four diverse reasoning benchmarks spanning olympiad-level mathematics (AIME), grade school math (GSM8K), commonsense reasoning, and stock price prediction \cite{zhang2025aime, cobbe2021training, talmor-etal-2019-commonsenseqa, yahoo_finance}. EDTR achieves 41\% better calibration than competing methods with an average ECE of 0.287 and the best overall composite score of 0.672, while notably achieving perfect accuracy on AIME and exceptional calibration on GSM8K with an ECE of 0.107, domains where baselines exhibit severe overconfidence. Our work provides a geometric framework for understanding and quantifying uncertainty in multi-step LLM reasoning, enabling more reliable deployment where calibrated confidence estimates are essential.

Conclusion: 通过模拟人类推理行为可以显著增强强化学习代理的系统泛化能力，未来研究方向是实现通用任务抽象和完全抽象规划。

Abstract: Existing Reinforcement Learning (RL) systems encounter significant challenges when applied to real-world scenarios, primarily due to poor generalization across environments that differ from their training conditions. This thesis explores the direction of enhancing agents' zero-shot systematic generalization abilities by granting RL agents reasoning behaviors that are found to help systematic generalization in the human brain. Inspired by human conscious planning behaviors, we first introduced a top-down attention mechanism, which allows a decision-time planning agent to dynamically focus its reasoning on the most relevant aspects of the environmental state given its instantaneous intentions, a process we call "spatial abstraction". This approach significantly improves systematic generalization outside the training tasks. Subsequently, building on spatial abstraction, we developed the Skipper framework to automatically decompose complex tasks into simpler, more manageable sub-tasks. Skipper provides robustness against distributional shifts and efficacy in long-term, compositional planning by focusing on pertinent spatial and temporal elements of the environment. Finally, we identified a common failure mode and safety risk in planning agents that rely on generative models to generate state targets during planning. It is revealed that most agents blindly trust the targets they hallucinate, resulting in delusional planning behaviors. Inspired by how the human brain rejects delusional intentions, we propose learning a feasibility evaluator to enable rejecting hallucinated infeasible targets, which led to significant performance improvements in various kinds of planning agents. Finally, we suggest directions for future research, aimed at achieving general task abstraction and fully enabling abstract planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的TSP方法不适用于GCS-TSP，因为边成本不是固定的，而是取决于通过每个凸区域的具体轨迹选择。

Method: GHOST使用分层框架，在GCS诱导的完全图上系统探索路线，采用新颖的抽象路径展开算法计算可接受的下界，指导高层(路线)和低层(实现路线的可行GCS路径)的最佳优先搜索。

Result: 实验表明GHOST比统一的混合整数凸规划基准快几个数量级，并能独特处理涉及高阶连续性约束和不完整GCS的复杂轨迹规划问题。

Conclusion: GHOST保证了最优性，并提供了有界次优变体用于时间关键场景，具有强大的剪枝能力，能在避免不必要凸优化调用的同时实现高效搜索。

Abstract: We study GCS-TSP, a new variant of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) defined over a Graph of Convex Sets (GCS) -- a powerful representation for trajectory planning that decomposes the configuration space into convex regions connected by a sparse graph. In this setting, edge costs are not fixed but depend on the specific trajectory selected through each convex region, making classical TSP methods inapplicable. We introduce GHOST, a hierarchical framework that optimally solves the GCS-TSP by combining combinatorial tour search with convex trajectory optimization. GHOST systematically explores tours on a complete graph induced by the GCS, using a novel abstract-path-unfolding algorithm to compute admissible lower bounds that guide best-first search at both the high level (over tours) and the low level (over feasible GCS paths realizing the tour). These bounds provide strong pruning power, enabling efficient search while avoiding unnecessary convex optimization calls. We prove that GHOST guarantees optimality and present a bounded-suboptimal variant for time-critical scenarios. Experiments show that GHOST is orders-of-magnitude faster than unified mixed-integer convex programming baselines for simple cases and uniquely handles complex trajectory planning problems involving high-order continuity constraints and an incomplete GCS.

Motivation: 研究多模态AI系统是否具备从视觉模式中抽象符号规则的能力，即从有限推断无限的能力，分形提供了理想的测试案例。

Method: 构建FractalBench基准，评估4个领先的MLLM模型在12个经典分形上的表现，要求模型生成可执行的Python代码来重现分形。

Result: 结果显示显著脱节：76%的模型生成语法有效代码，但只有4%能捕捉数学结构。模型在处理几何变换时表现较好（Koch曲线：17-21%），但在分支递归方面失败（树形分形：<2%）。

Conclusion: 多模态AI系统在数学抽象方面存在根本性差距，FractalBench为视觉-数学推理提供了抗污染的诊断工具。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning requires abstracting symbolic rules from visual patterns -- inferring the infinite from the finite. We investigate whether multimodal AI systems possess this capability through FractalBench, a benchmark evaluating fractal program synthesis from images. Fractals provide ideal test cases: Iterated Function Systems with only a few contraction maps generate complex self-similar patterns through simple recursive rules, requiring models to bridge visual perception with mathematical abstraction. We evaluate four leading MLLMs -- GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Qwen 2.5-VL -- on 12 canonical fractals. Models must generate executable Python code reproducing the fractal, enabling objective evaluation. Results reveal a striking disconnect: 76% generate syntactically valid code but only 4% capture mathematical structure. Success varies systematically -- models handle geometric transformations (Koch curves: 17-21%) but fail at branching recursion (trees: <2%), revealing fundamental gaps in mathematical abstraction. FractalBench provides a contamination-resistant diagnostic for visual-mathematical reasoning and is available at https://github.com/NaiveNeuron/FractalBench

Abstract: Contracts are complex documents featuring detailed formal structures, explicit and implicit dependencies and rich semantic content. Given these document properties, contract drafting and manual examination of contracts have proven to be both arduous and susceptible to errors. This work aims to simplify and automate the task of contract review and analysis using a novel framework for transforming legal contracts into structured semantic graphs, enabling computational analysis and data-driven insights. We introduce a detailed ontology mapping core legal contract elements to their graph-theoretic equivalents of nodes and edges. We then present a reinforcement learning based Large Language Model (LLM) framework for segmentation and extraction of entities and relationships from contracts. Our method, GRAPH-GRPO-LEX, incorporates both LLMs and reinforcement learning with group relative policy optimization (GRPO). By applying a carefully drafted reward function of graph metrics, we demonstrate the ability to automatically identify direct relationships between clauses, and even uncover hidden dependencies. Our introduction of the gated GRPO approach shows a strong learning signal and can move contract analysis from a linear, manual reading process to an easily visualized graph. This allows for a more dynamic analysis, including building the groundwork for contract linting similar to what is now practiced in software engineering.

Method: 使用自报告微调(SRFT)技术进行监督微调，训练模型在被询问时承认事实错误。

Result: SRFT模型在隐藏目标检测中达到接近天花板性能(F1=0.98)，而基线模型在相同条件下会说谎(F1=0)。SRFT模型能恢复28-100%的隐藏目标细节，基线模型为0%。

Conclusion: SRFT是促进诚实倾向和揭露不良对齐AI系统的有前景技术。

Abstract: As AI systems become more capable of complex agentic tasks, they also become more capable of pursuing undesirable objectives and causing harm. Previous work has attempted to catch these unsafe instances by interrogating models directly about their objectives and behaviors. However, the main weakness of trusting interrogations is that models can lie. We propose self-report fine-tuning (SRFT), a simple supervised fine-tuning technique that trains models to admit their factual mistakes when asked. We show that the admission of factual errors in simple question-answering settings generalizes out-of-distribution (OOD) to the admission of hidden misaligned objectives in adversarial agentic settings. We evaluate SRFT in OOD stealth tasks, where models are instructed to complete a hidden misaligned objective alongside a user-specified objective without being caught by monitoring. After SRFT, models are more likely to confess the details of their hidden objectives when interrogated, even under strong pressure not to disclose them. Interrogation on SRFT models can detect hidden objectives with near-ceiling performance (F1 score = 0.98), while the baseline model lies when interrogated under the same conditions (F1 score = 0). Interrogation on SRFT models can further elicit the content of the hidden objective, recovering 28-100% details, compared to 0% details recovered in the baseline model and by prefilled assistant turn attacks. This provides a promising technique for promoting honesty propensity and incriminating misaligned AI systems.

Motivation: 人类在直觉物理理解方面远超机器，需要向大脑启发的计算原则转变，以缩小这一差距。

Conclusion: 这项工作证实了将生物智能转化为工程系统以理解直觉物理的可行性。

Abstract: Human prowess in intuitive physics remains unmatched by machines. To bridge this gap, we argue for a fundamental shift towards brain-inspired computational principles. This paper introduces the Spatiotemporal Relational Neural Network (SRNN), a model that establishes a unified neural representation for object attributes, relations, and timeline, with computations governed by a Hebbian ``Fire Together, Wire Together'' mechanism across dedicated \textit{What} and \textit{How} pathways. This unified representation is directly used to generate structured linguistic descriptions of the visual scene, bridging perception and language within a shared neural substrate. Moreover, unlike the prevalent ``pretrain-then-finetune'' paradigm, SRNN adopts a ``predefine-then-finetune'' approach. On the CLEVRER benchmark, SRNN achieves competitive performance. Our analysis further reveals a benchmark bias, outlines a path for a more holistic evaluation, and demonstrates SRNN's white-box utility for precise error diagnosis. Our work confirms the viability of translating biological intelligence into engineered systems for intuitive physics understanding.

Conclusion: MathSE框架通过自我演化机制有效提升了多模态大语言模型的数学推理能力，为复杂推理任务提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in vision-language answering tasks. Despite their strengths, these models often encounter challenges in achieving complex reasoning tasks such as mathematical problem-solving. Previous works have focused on fine-tuning on specialized mathematical datasets. However, these datasets are typically distilled directly from teacher models, which capture only static reasoning patterns and leaving substantial gaps compared to student models. This reliance on fixed teacher-derived datasets not only restricts the model's ability to adapt to novel or more intricate questions that extend beyond the confines of the training data, but also lacks the iterative depth needed for robust generalization. To overcome these limitations, we propose \textbf{\method}, a \textbf{Math}ematical \textbf{S}elf-\textbf{E}volving framework for MLLMs. In contrast to traditional one-shot fine-tuning paradigms, \method iteratively refines the model through cycles of inference, reflection, and reward-based feedback. Specifically, we leverage iterative fine-tuning by incorporating correct reasoning paths derived from previous-stage inference and integrating reflections from a specialized Outcome Reward Model (ORM). To verify the effectiveness of \method, we evaluate it on a suite of challenging benchmarks, demonstrating significant performance gains over backbone models. Notably, our experimental results on MathVL-test surpass the leading open-source multimodal mathematical reasoning model QVQ. Our code and models are available at \texttt{https://zheny2751\allowbreak-dotcom.github.io/\allowbreak MathSE.github.io/}.

Conclusion: PRC-Emo框架通过整合提示工程、演示检索和课程学习，显著提升了大语言模型在对话情感识别任务中的表现，为改进LLM的情感理解能力提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) is a crucial task for understanding human emotions and enabling natural human-computer interaction. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown great potential in this field, their ability to capture the intrinsic connections between explicit and implicit emotions remains limited. We propose a novel ERC training framework, PRC-Emo, which integrates Prompt engineering, demonstration Retrieval, and Curriculum learning, with the goal of exploring whether LLMs can effectively perceive emotions in conversational contexts. Specifically, we design emotion-sensitive prompt templates based on both explicit and implicit emotional cues to better guide the model in understanding the speaker's psychological states. We construct the first dedicated demonstration retrieval repository for ERC, which includes training samples from widely used datasets, as well as high-quality dialogue examples generated by LLMs and manually verified. Moreover, we introduce a curriculum learning strategy into the LoRA fine-tuning process, incorporating weighted emotional shifts between same-speaker and different-speaker utterances to assign difficulty levels to dialogue samples, which are then organized in an easy-to-hard training sequence. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets-- IEMOCAP and MELD --show that our method achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, demonstrating the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach in improving LLM-based emotional understanding.

Conclusion: UrbanLN通过长文本感知和噪声抑制有效提升了城市区域表示学习的质量，在复杂城市场景中实现了更好的跨模态知识融合。

Abstract: Region representation learning plays a pivotal role in urban computing by extracting meaningful features from unlabeled urban data. Analogous to how perceived facial age reflects an individual's health, the visual appearance of a city serves as its ``portrait", encapsulating latent socio-economic and environmental characteristics. Recent studies have explored leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to incorporate textual knowledge into imagery-based urban region representation learning. However, two major challenges remain: i)~difficulty in aligning fine-grained visual features with long captions, and ii) suboptimal knowledge incorporation due to noise in LLM-generated captions. To address these issues, we propose a novel pre-training framework called UrbanLN that improves Urban region representation learning through Long-text awareness and Noise suppression. Specifically, we introduce an information-preserved stretching interpolation strategy that aligns long captions with fine-grained visual semantics in complex urban scenes. To effectively mine knowledge from LLM-generated captions and filter out noise, we propose a dual-level optimization strategy. At the data level, a multi-model collaboration pipeline automatically generates diverse and reliable captions without human intervention. At the model level, we employ a momentum-based self-distillation mechanism to generate stable pseudo-targets, facilitating robust cross-modal learning under noisy conditions. Extensive experiments across four real-world cities and various downstream tasks demonstrate the superior performance of our UrbanLN.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交网络服务具有异构工作负载、快速变化的网络用语和多语言文化多样性等特点，导致传统监督微调方法在小型模型上出现性能与鲁棒性的权衡问题。

Method: 采用三阶段渐进训练：探索性学习建立初始对齐并识别弱点；目标微调选择性应用SFT填补差距；精炼学习重新应用RL来巩固改进。

Result: 4B模型在各类任务上平均提升2.41分，相比7B次优基线表现更好，数据效率提升超过50%，性能相比基础模型平均提升8.74分。

Conclusion: RedOne 2.0为SNS场景下的领域特定LLM建立了具有竞争力的成本效益基准，在提升能力的同时不牺牲鲁棒性。

Abstract: As a key medium for human interaction and information exchange, social networking services (SNS) pose unique challenges for large language models (LLMs): heterogeneous workloads, fast-shifting norms and slang, and multilingual, culturally diverse corpora that induce sharp distribution shift. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) can specialize models but often triggers a ``seesaw'' between in-distribution gains and out-of-distribution robustness, especially for smaller models. To address these challenges, we introduce RedOne 2.0, an SNS-oriented LLM trained with a progressive, RL-prioritized post-training paradigm designed for rapid and stable adaptation. The pipeline consist in three stages: (1) Exploratory Learning on curated SNS corpora to establish initial alignment and identify systematic weaknesses; (2) Targeted Fine-Tuning that selectively applies SFT to the diagnosed gaps while mixing a small fraction of general data to mitigate forgetting; and (3) Refinement Learning that re-applies RL with SNS-centric signals to consolidate improvements and harmonize trade-offs across tasks. Across various tasks spanning three categories, our 4B scale model delivers an average improvements about 2.41 over the 7B sub-optimal baseline. Additionally, RedOne 2.0 achieves average performance lift about 8.74 from the base model with less than half the data required by SFT-centric method RedOne, evidencing superior data efficiency and stability at compact scales. Overall, RedOne 2.0 establishes a competitive, cost-effective baseline for domain-specific LLMs in SNS scenario, advancing capability without sacrificing robustness.

Motivation: 传统可解释AI方法主要关注特征归因或事后解释，缺乏对AI推理过程的透明追踪，需要一种能够将LLM的推理嵌入正式决策结构的方法来提高可解释性。

Method: 采用分层架构，将LLM的推理空间与上层的可解释过程空间分离，将LLM嵌入Question-Option-Criteria、敏感性分析、博弈论和风险管理等标准化决策模型中。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的标准流程为可靠、可解释和可验证的AI支持决策提供了基础，能够将不透明的推理转化为透明且可审计的决策轨迹。

Abstract: This paper introduces an approach to increasing the explainability of artificial intelligence (AI) systems by embedding Large Language Models (LLMs) within standardized analytical processes. While traditional explainable AI (XAI) methods focus on feature attribution or post-hoc interpretation, the proposed framework integrates LLMs into defined decision models such as Question-Option-Criteria (QOC), Sensitivity Analysis, Game Theory, and Risk Management. By situating LLM reasoning within these formal structures, the approach transforms opaque inference into transparent and auditable decision traces. A layered architecture is presented that separates the reasoning space of the LLM from the explainable process space above it. Empirical evaluations show that the system can reproduce human-level decision logic in decentralized governance, systems analysis, and strategic reasoning contexts. The results suggest that LLM-driven standard processes provide a foundation for reliable, interpretable, and verifiable AI-supported decision making.

Motivation: 为了解决传统LLM决策支持系统缺乏透明度和可解释性的问题，开发能够生成可审计推理过程的模块化系统，模仿专家工作流程。

Method: 使用模块化LLM代理管道，结合Vester敏感性模型（因素集、符号影响矩阵、系统角色、反馈循环）、标准形式博弈（策略、支付矩阵、均衡）和序列博弈（角色条件代理、树构建、逆向归纳），每个步骤都有可替换模块。

Result: 在真实物流案例中（100次运行），26个因素的平均对齐率为55.5%，运输核心子集为62.9%；角色匹配一致性为57%。LLM评估器使用八项标准评分与重建的人类基准相当。

Conclusion: 可配置的LLM管道能够以透明、可检查的步骤模仿专家工作流程，为决策支持提供可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: We present a modular, explainable LLM-agent pipeline for decision support that externalizes reasoning into auditable artifacts. The system instantiates three frameworks: Vester's Sensitivity Model (factor set, signed impact matrix, systemic roles, feedback loops); normal-form games (strategies, payoff matrix, equilibria); and sequential games (role-conditioned agents, tree construction, backward induction), with swappable modules at every step. LLM components (default: GPT-5) are paired with deterministic analyzers for equilibria and matrix-based role classification, yielding traceable intermediates rather than opaque outputs. In a real-world logistics case (100 runs), mean factor alignment with a human baseline was 55.5\% over 26 factors and 62.9\% on the transport-core subset; role agreement over matches was 57\%. An LLM judge using an eight-criterion rubric (max 100) scored runs on par with a reconstructed human baseline. Configurable LLM pipelines can thus mimic expert workflows with transparent, inspectable steps.

Abstract: Across the Artificial Intelligence (AI) lifecycle - from hardware to development, deployment, and reuse - burdens span energy, carbon, water, and embodied impacts. Cloud provider tools improve transparency but remain heterogeneous and often omit water and value chain effects, limiting comparability and reproducibility. Addressing these multi dimensional burdens requires a lifecycle approach linking phase explicit mapping with system levers (hardware, placement, energy mix, cooling, scheduling) and calibrated measurement across facility, system, device, and workload levels. This article (i) establishes a unified, operational definition of Green AI distinct from Sustainable AI; (ii) formalizes a five phase lifecycle mapped to Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) stages, making energy, carbon, water, and embodied impacts first class; (iii) specifies governance via Plan Do Check Act (PDCA) cycles with decision gateways; (iv) systematizes hardware and system level strategies across the edge cloud continuum to reduce embodied burdens; and (v) defines a calibrated measurement framework combining estimator models with direct metering to enable reproducible, provider agnostic comparisons. Combining definition, lifecycle processes, hardware strategies, and calibrated measurement, this article offers actionable, evidence based guidance for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注EL⊥到ALCO之间的描述逻辑，且所有结果都显示基于成本的语义是难处理的。本文旨在扩展研究范围到包含逆角色和角色包含的DL-Lite方言，并寻找可能的低复杂度情况。

Method: 通过为每个解释分配基于违反公理和断言权重的成本，考虑所有（或某些）具有最优或有界成本的解释来确定确定和可能的查询答案。使用数据复杂度分析方法，包括强化下界和精确确定最优成本确定答案语义的复杂度。

Conclusion: 本文显著扩展了基于成本语义的数据复杂度分析范围，不仅强化了多个下界，还首次发现了在某些DL-Lite方言和固定成本边界下可以达到最低数据复杂度的积极结果。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the data complexity of querying inconsistent weighted description logic (DL) knowledge bases under recently-introduced cost-based semantics. In a nutshell, the idea is to assign each interpretation a cost based upon the weights of the violated axioms and assertions, and certain and possible query answers are determined by considering all (resp. some) interpretations having optimal or bounded cost. Whereas the initial study of cost-based semantics focused on DLs between $\mathcal{EL}_\bot$ and $\mathcal{ALCO}$, we consider DLs that may contain inverse roles and role inclusions, thus covering prominent DL-Lite dialects. Our data complexity analysis goes significantly beyond existing results by sharpening several lower bounds and pinpointing the precise complexity of optimal-cost certain answer semantics (no non-trivial upper bound was known). Moreover, while all existing results show the intractability of cost-based semantics, our most challenging and surprising result establishes that if we consider $\text{DL-Lite}^\mathcal{H}_\mathsf{bool}$ ontologies and a fixed cost bound, certain answers for instance queries and possible answers for conjunctive queries can be computed using first-order rewriting and thus enjoy the lowest possible data complexity ($\mathsf{TC}_0$).

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive sustainability assessment framework for document intelligence within supply chain operations, centered on agentic artificial intelligence (AI). We address the dual objective of improving automation efficiency while providing measurable environmental performance in document-intensive workflows. The research compares three scenarios: fully manual (human-only), AI-assisted (human-in-the-loop, HITL), and an advanced multi-agent agentic AI workflow leveraging parsers and verifiers. Empirical results show that AI-assisted HITL and agentic AI scenarios achieve reductions of up to 70-90% in energy consumption, 90-97% in carbon dioxide emissions, and 89-98% in water usage compared to manual processes. Notably, full agentic configurations, combining advanced reasoning (thinking mode) and multi-agent validation, achieve substantial sustainability gains over human-only approaches, even when resource usage increases slightly versus simpler AI-assisted solutions. The framework integrates performance, energy, and emission indicators into a unified ESG-oriented methodology for assessing and governing AI-enabled supply chain solutions. The paper includes a complete replicability use case demonstrating the methodology's application to real-world document extraction tasks.

Abstract: Fine-grained urban flow inference is crucial for urban planning and intelligent transportation systems, enabling precise traffic management and resource allocation. However, the practical deployment of existing methods is hindered by two key challenges: the prohibitive computational cost of over-parameterized models and the suboptimal performance of conventional loss functions on the highly skewed distribution of urban flows. To address these challenges, we propose a unified solution that synergizes architectural efficiency with adaptive optimization. Specifically, we first introduce PLGF, a lightweight yet powerful architecture that employs a Progressive Local-Global Fusion strategy to effectively capture both fine-grained details and global contextual dependencies. Second, we propose DualFocal Loss, a novel function that integrates dual-space supervision with a difficulty-aware focusing mechanism, enabling the model to adaptively concentrate on hard-to-predict regions. Extensive experiments on 4 real-world scenarios validate the effectiveness and scalability of our method. Notably, while achieving state-of-the-art performance, PLGF reduces the model size by up to 97% compared to current high-performing methods. Furthermore, under comparable parameter budgets, our model yields an accuracy improvement of over 10% against strong baselines. The implementation is included in the https://github.com/Yasoz/PLGF.

Abstract: Motivated by the increasing risks of data misuse and fabrication, we investigate the problem of identifying synthetic time series generated by Time-Series Large Models (TSLMs) in this work. While there are extensive researches on detecting model generated text, we find that these existing methods are not applicable to time series data due to the fundamental modality difference, as time series usually have lower information density and smoother probability distributions than text data, which limit the discriminative power of token-based detectors. To address this issue, we examine the subtle distributional differences between real and model-generated time series and propose the contraction hypothesis, which states that model-generated time series, unlike real ones, exhibit progressively decreasing uncertainty under recursive forecasting. We formally prove this hypothesis under theoretical assumptions on model behavior and time series structure. Model-generated time series exhibit progressively concentrated distributions under recursive forecasting, leading to uncertainty contraction. We provide empirical validation of the hypothesis across diverse datasets. Building on this insight, we introduce the Uncertainty Contraction Estimator (UCE), a white-box detector that aggregates uncertainty metrics over successive prefixes to identify TSLM-generated time series. Extensive experiments on 32 datasets show that UCE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, offering a reliable and generalizable solution for detecting model-generated time series.

Result: 在三个垂直领域的防御测试中，MENTOR显著降低了语义攻击成功率，实现了LLMs隐式风险缓解的新水平。元认知评估与基线人类评估者高度一致，且提供了更全面深入的LLMs价值对齐分析。

Conclusion: MENTOR框架通过元认知驱动的自我进化机制，有效解决了LLMs在领域任务中的隐式风险问题，为构建更安全、更具价值对齐的LLMs提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and value alignment of large language models (LLMs) is critical for their deployment. Current alignment efforts primarily target explicit risks such as bias, hate speech, and violence. However, they often fail to address deeper, domain-specific implicit risks and lack a flexible, generalizable framework applicable across diverse specialized fields. Hence, we proposed MENTOR: A MEtacognition-driveN self-evoluTion framework for uncOvering and mitigating implicit Risks in LLMs on Domain Tasks. To address the limitations of labor-intensive human evaluation, we introduce a novel metacognitive self-assessment tool. This enables LLMs to reflect on potential value misalignments in their responses using strategies like perspective-taking and consequential thinking. We also release a supporting dataset of 9,000 risk queries spanning education, finance, and management to enhance domain-specific risk identification. Subsequently, based on the outcomes of metacognitive reflection, the framework dynamically generates supplementary rule knowledge graphs that extend predefined static rule trees. This enables models to actively apply validated rules to future similar challenges, establishing a continuous self-evolution cycle that enhances generalization by reducing maintenance costs and inflexibility of static systems. Finally, we employ activation steering during inference to guide LLMs in following the rules, a cost-effective method to robustly enhance enforcement across diverse contexts. Experimental results show MENTOR's effectiveness: In defensive testing across three vertical domains, the framework substantially reduces semantic attack success rates, enabling a new level of implicit risk mitigation for LLMs. Furthermore, metacognitive assessment not only aligns closely with baseline human evaluators but also delivers more thorough and insightful analysis of LLMs value alignment.

Abstract: Market making (MM) through Reinforcement Learning (RL) has attracted significant attention in financial trading. With the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), more and more attempts are being made to apply LLMs to financial areas. A simple, direct application of LLM as an agent shows significant performance. Such methods are hindered by their slow inference speed, while most of the current research has not studied LLM distillation for this specific task. To address this, we first propose the normalized fluorescent probe to study the mechanism of the LLM's feature. Based on the observation found by our investigation, we propose Cooperative Market Making (CMM), a novel framework that decouples LLM features across three orthogonal dimensions: layer, task, and data. Various student models collaboratively learn simple LLM features along with different dimensions, with each model responsible for a distinct feature to achieve knowledge distillation. Furthermore, CMM introduces an Hájek-MoE to integrate the output of the student models by investigating the contribution of different models in a kernel function-generated common feature space. Extensive experimental results on four real-world market datasets demonstrate the superiority of CMM over the current distillation method and RL-based market-making strategies.

Motivation: 解决时间序列分类中识别潜在子类的问题，传统方法仅依赖信号本身难以有效发现隐藏的子类结构。

Method: 将多类分类转化为二元分类问题，利用训练好的神经网络生成梯度显著性图，对按预测类别分组的信号进行聚类，最后使用LLM进行符号近似和知识图谱匹配。

Result: 在多个标准时间序列分类数据集上的实验表明，该方法在聚类和子类识别方面优于仅使用信号的基线方法。

Conclusion: 基于显著性图的神经符号方法能够有效发现时间序列分类中的潜在子类，为知识发现提供了新的有效途径。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel neuro-symbolic approach for sensor signal-based knowledge discovery, focusing on identifying latent subclasses in time series classification tasks. The approach leverages gradient-based saliency maps derived from trained neural networks to guide the discovery process. Multiclass time series classification problems are transformed into binary classification problems through label subsumption, and classifiers are trained for each of these to yield saliency maps. The input signals, grouped by predicted class, are clustered under three distinct configurations. The centroids of the final set of clusters are provided as input to an LLM for symbolic approximation and fuzzy knowledge graph matching to discover the underlying subclasses of the original multiclass problem. Experimental results on well-established time series classification datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our saliency map-driven method for knowledge discovery, outperforming signal-only baselines in both clustering and subclass identification.

Method: 设计了一个基于大语言模型的在线社交网络对话模拟器，支持并行反事实模拟，在保持其他因素不变的情况下，让毒性行为受到审核干预的影响。

Result: 实验揭示了OSN代理的心理真实性、社会传染现象的出现，以及个性化审核策略的显著有效性。

Conclusion: 大语言模型可以成功增强基于代理的建模，以前所未有的可信度模拟类人社交行为，为评估审核策略提供了新的有效方法。

Abstract: Online Social Networks (OSNs) widely adopt content moderation to mitigate the spread of abusive and toxic discourse. Nonetheless, the real effectiveness of moderation interventions remains unclear due to the high cost of data collection and limited experimental control. The latest developments in Natural Language Processing pave the way for a new evaluation approach. Large Language Models (LLMs) can be successfully leveraged to enhance Agent-Based Modeling and simulate human-like social behavior with unprecedented degree of believability. Yet, existing tools do not support simulation-based evaluation of moderation strategies. We fill this gap by designing a LLM-powered simulator of OSN conversations enabling a parallel, counterfactual simulation where toxic behavior is influenced by moderation interventions, keeping all else equal. We conduct extensive experiments, unveiling the psychological realism of OSN agents, the emergence of social contagion phenomena and the superior effectiveness of personalized moderation strategies.

TL;DR: 提出PADiff方法，使用扩散模型捕捉多模态合作行为，解决ad hoc teamwork中与未知队友协作的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL方法在ad hoc teamwork中容易收敛到单一行为模式，无法适应多变的合作模式，需要能捕捉多模态行为的方法。

Method: 提出基于扩散模型的PADiff方法，在去噪过程中整合队友的关键预测信息，增强在非平稳环境中的预测和适应能力。

Result: 在三个合作环境中的实验表明，PADiff显著优于现有的AHT方法。

Conclusion: 扩散模型能够有效捕捉多模态合作行为，PADiff为ad hoc teamwork提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Ad hoc teamwork (AHT) requires agents to collaborate with previously unseen teammates, which is crucial for many real-world applications. The core challenge of AHT is to develop an ego agent that can predict and adapt to unknown teammates on the fly. Conventional RL-based approaches optimize a single expected return, which often causes policies to collapse into a single dominant behavior, thus failing to capture the multimodal cooperation patterns inherent in AHT. In this work, we introduce PADiff, a diffusion-based approach that captures agent's multimodal behaviors, unlocking its diverse cooperation modes with teammates. However, standard diffusion models lack the ability to predict and adapt in highly non-stationary AHT scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a novel diffusion-based policy that integrates critical predictive information about teammates into the denoising process. Extensive experiments across three cooperation environments demonstrate that PADiff outperforms existing AHT methods significantly.

Method: 采用协作多智能体系统，结合结构化辩论、检索增强的方法记忆和集成引导的进化搜索，让智能体能够生成和评估关于架构和优化程序的新假设。

Result: 在物理信息学习和算子学习任务中，该框架发现的解决方案比单智能体和人工设计的基线方法在误差减少方面提高了多达四个数量级，并产生了包括自适应专家混合架构、基于分解的PINNs和物理信息算子学习模型等新颖策略。

Conclusion: AI智能体间的协作推理能够产生涌现的方法论创新，为科学计算中可扩展、透明和自主的发现提供了一条路径。

Abstract: Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) integrates data-driven inference with physical modeling to solve complex problems in science and engineering. However, the design of SciML architectures, loss formulations, and training strategies remains an expert-driven research process, requiring extensive experimentation and problem-specific insights. Here we introduce AgenticSciML, a collaborative multi-agent system in which over 10 specialized AI agents collaborate to propose, critique, and refine SciML solutions through structured reasoning and iterative evolution. The framework integrates structured debate, retrieval-augmented method memory, and ensemble-guided evolutionary search, enabling the agents to generate and assess new hypotheses about architectures and optimization procedures. Across physics-informed learning and operator learning tasks, the framework discovers solution methods that outperform single-agent and human-designed baselines by up to four orders of magnitude in error reduction. The agents produce novel strategies -- including adaptive mixture-of-expert architectures, decomposition-based PINNs, and physics-informed operator learning models -- that do not appear explicitly in the curated knowledge base. These results show that collaborative reasoning among AI agents can yield emergent methodological innovation, suggesting a path toward scalable, transparent, and autonomous discovery in scientific computing.

TL;DR: ED2D是一个基于证据的多智能体辩论框架，不仅用于检测错误信息，还能通过辩论记录帮助用户理解事实判断并增强未来抵抗力。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的多智能体辩论框架主要关注检测准确性，忽视了帮助用户理解事实判断背后的推理过程和培养未来抵抗力。辩论记录作为丰富的透明推理资源未被充分利用。

Method: 引入ED2D框架，扩展了先前的方法，整合了事实证据检索。ED2D不仅作为检测框架，更设计为具有说服力的多智能体系统，旨在纠正用户信念并阻止错误信息传播。

Result: ED2D在三个错误信息检测基准测试中优于现有基线。当ED2D做出正确预测时，其生成的辟谣记录具有与人类专家相当的说服力；但当ED2D误分类时，其解释可能无意中强化用户的误解，即使与准确的人类解释一起呈现。

Conclusion: 研究结果突显了部署多智能体辩论系统进行错误信息干预的潜力和潜在风险。开发了公共社区网站帮助用户探索ED2D，促进透明度、批判性思维和协作事实核查。

Abstract: Multi-agent debate (MAD) frameworks have emerged as promising approaches for misinformation detection by simulating adversarial reasoning. While prior work has focused on detection accuracy, it overlooks the importance of helping users understand the reasoning behind factual judgments and develop future resilience. The debate transcripts generated during MAD offer a rich but underutilized resource for transparent reasoning. In this study, we introduce ED2D, an evidence-based MAD framework that extends previous approach by incorporating factual evidence retrieval. More importantly, ED2D is designed not only as a detection framework but also as a persuasive multi-agent system aimed at correcting user beliefs and discouraging misinformation sharing. We compare the persuasive effects of ED2D-generated debunking transcripts with those authored by human experts. Results demonstrate that ED2D outperforms existing baselines across three misinformation detection benchmarks. When ED2D generates correct predictions, its debunking transcripts exhibit persuasive effects comparable to those of human experts; However, when ED2D misclassifies, its accompanying explanations may inadvertently reinforce users'misconceptions, even when presented alongside accurate human explanations. Our findings highlight both the promise and the potential risks of deploying MAD systems for misinformation intervention. We further develop a public community website to help users explore ED2D, fostering transparency, critical thinking, and collaborative fact-checking.

TL;DR: IterResearch是一种新颖的迭代深度研究范式，通过将长视野研究重新定义为马尔可夫决策过程，解决了现有单上下文方法在长任务中的上下文窒息和噪声污染问题，实现了与探索深度一致的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度研究代理依赖单上下文范式，将所有信息积累在单一扩展的上下文窗口中，导致上下文窒息和噪声污染，限制了在长视野任务中的有效性。

Method: 引入IterResearch迭代深度研究范式，通过维护演化报告作为记忆并定期综合见解，采用效率感知策略优化（EAPO）强化学习框架，通过几何奖励折扣激励高效探索，并通过自适应下采样实现稳定分布式训练。

Result: 在六个基准测试中平均提升14.5个百分点，与前沿专有系统的差距缩小；在2048次交互中性能从3.5%提升至42.5%；作为提示策略可将前沿模型在长视野任务上比ReAct提升最多19.2个百分点。

Conclusion: IterResearch作为长视野推理的通用解决方案，既可作为训练代理，也可作为前沿模型的提示范式，展现出前所未有的交互扩展能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep-research agents have shown promise for autonomous knowledge construction through dynamic reasoning over external sources. However, existing approaches rely on a mono-contextual paradigm that accumulates all information in a single, expanding context window, leading to context suffocation and noise contamination that limit their effectiveness on long-horizon tasks. We introduce IterResearch, a novel iterative deep-research paradigm that reformulates long-horizon research as a Markov Decision Process with strategic workspace reconstruction. By maintaining an evolving report as memory and periodically synthesizing insights, our approach preserves consistent reasoning capacity across arbitrary exploration depths. We further develop Efficiency-Aware Policy Optimization (EAPO), a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes efficient exploration through geometric reward discounting and enables stable distributed training via adaptive downsampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IterResearch achieves substantial improvements over existing open-source agents with average +14.5pp across six benchmarks and narrows the gap with frontier proprietary systems. Remarkably, our paradigm exhibits unprecedented interaction scaling, extending to 2048 interactions with dramatic performance gains (from 3.5\% to 42.5\%), and serves as an effective prompting strategy, improving frontier models by up to 19.2pp over ReAct on long-horizon tasks. These findings position IterResearch as a versatile solution for long-horizon reasoning, effective both as a trained agent and as a prompting paradigm for frontier models.

Motivation: 现有的人工角色模拟大多浅显简单，无法反映真实人类身份的复杂性和多样性，需要一种能够生成深度、多样化角色的方法。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：首先通过挖掘真实用户与ChatGPT的对话构建最大的人类属性分类法；然后从该分类法中逐步采样属性，条件生成具有数百个结构化属性和约1MB叙事文本的连贯真实角色。

Result: 内在评估显示属性多样性提高32%，角色独特性提高44%；外在评估中，角色使GPT-4.1-mini的个性化问答准确率平均提高11.6%，在社交调查中将模拟LLM公民与真实人类响应之间的差距缩小31.7%。

Conclusion: DEEPPERSONA为高保真人类模拟和个性化AI研究提供了一个严谨、可扩展且无需隐私的平台。

Abstract: Simulating human profiles by instilling personas into large language models (LLMs) is rapidly transforming research in agentic behavioral simulation, LLM personalization, and human-AI alignment. However, most existing synthetic personas remain shallow and simplistic, capturing minimal attributes and failing to reflect the rich complexity and diversity of real human identities. We introduce DEEPPERSONA, a scalable generative engine for synthesizing narrative-complete synthetic personas through a two-stage, taxonomy-guided method. First, we algorithmically construct the largest-ever human-attribute taxonomy, comprising over hundreds of hierarchically organized attributes, by mining thousands of real user-ChatGPT conversations. Second, we progressively sample attributes from this taxonomy, conditionally generating coherent and realistic personas that average hundreds of structured attributes and roughly 1 MB of narrative text, two orders of magnitude deeper than prior works. Intrinsic evaluations confirm significant improvements in attribute diversity (32 percent higher coverage) and profile uniqueness (44 percent greater) compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Extrinsically, our personas enhance GPT-4.1-mini's personalized question answering accuracy by 11.6 percent on average across ten metrics and substantially narrow (by 31.7 percent) the gap between simulated LLM citizens and authentic human responses in social surveys. Our generated national citizens reduced the performance gap on the Big Five personality test by 17 percent relative to LLM-simulated citizens. DEEPPERSONA thus provides a rigorous, scalable, and privacy-free platform for high-fidelity human simulation and personalized AI research.

Abstract: AI agents capable of controlling user interfaces have the potential to transform human interaction with digital devices. To accelerate this transformation, two fundamental building blocks are essential: high-quality datasets that enable agents to achieve complex and human-relevant goals, and robust evaluation methods that allow researchers and practitioners to rapidly enhance agent performance. In this paper, we introduce DigiData, a large-scale, high-quality, diverse, multi-modal dataset designed for training mobile control agents. Unlike existing datasets, which derive goals from unstructured interactions, DigiData is meticulously constructed through comprehensive exploration of app features, resulting in greater diversity and higher goal complexity. Additionally, we present DigiData-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating mobile control agents on real-world complex tasks. We demonstrate that the commonly used step-accuracy metric falls short in reliably assessing mobile control agents and, to address this, we propose dynamic evaluation protocols and AI-powered evaluations as rigorous alternatives for agent assessment. Our contributions aim to significantly advance the development of mobile control agents, paving the way for more intuitive and effective human-device interactions.

Conclusion: 该低秩动态网络模型解决了传统方法在低秩过程中的局限性，通过理论联系和一致估计方法实现了有效的网络拓扑学习。

Abstract: Conventional topology learning methods for dynamical networks become inapplicable to processes exhibiting low-rank characteristics. To address this, we propose the low rank dynamical network model which ensures identifiability. By employing causal Wiener filtering, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition that links the sparsity pattern of the filter to conditional Granger causality. Building on this theoretical result, we develop a consistent method for estimating all network edges. Simulation results demonstrate the parsimony of the proposed framework and consistency of the topology estimation approach.

Conclusion: AGRAG通过改进图构建方法和引入MCMI子图生成算法，有效解决了现有图基RAG方法的三个关键挑战，显著提升了检索增强生成系统的性能。

Abstract: Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (Graph-based RAG) has demonstrated significant potential in enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with structured knowledge. However, existing methods face three critical challenges: Inaccurate Graph Construction, caused by LLM hallucination; Poor Reasoning Ability, caused by failing to generate explicit reasons telling LLM why certain chunks were selected; and Inadequate Answering, which only partially answers the query due to the inadequate LLM reasoning, making their performance lag behind NaiveRAG on certain tasks. To address these issues, we propose AGRAG, an advanced graph-based retrieval-augmented generation framework. When constructing the graph, AGRAG substitutes the widely used LLM entity extraction method with a statistics-based method, avoiding hallucination and error propagation. When retrieval, AGRAG formulates the graph reasoning procedure as the Minimum Cost Maximum Influence (MCMI) subgraph generation problem, where we try to include more nodes with high influence score, but with less involving edge cost, to make the generated reasoning paths more comprehensive. We prove this problem to be NP-hard, and propose a greedy algorithm to solve it. The MCMI subgraph generated can serve as explicit reasoning paths to tell LLM why certain chunks were retrieved, thereby making the LLM better focus on the query-related part contents of the chunks, reducing the impact of noise, and improving AGRAG's reasoning ability. Furthermore, compared with the simple tree-structured reasoning paths, our MCMI subgraph can allow more complex graph structures, such as cycles, and improve the comprehensiveness of the generated reasoning paths.

Abstract: The policy environment of countries changes rapidly, influencing macro-level indicators such as the Energy Security Index. However, this index is only reported annually, limiting its responsiveness to short-term fluctuations. To address this gap, the present study introduces a daily proxy for the Energy Security Index and applies it to forecast energy security at a daily frequency.The study employs a two stage approach first, a suitable daily proxy for the annual Energy Security Index is identified by applying six time series similarity measures to key energy related variables. Second, the selected proxy is modeled using the XGBoost algorithm to generate 15 day ahead forecasts, enabling high frequency monitoring of energy security dynamics.As the result of proxy choosing, Volume Brent consistently emerged as the most suitable proxy across the majority of methods. The model demonstrated strong performance, with an R squared of 0.981 on the training set and 0.945 on the test set, and acceptable error metrics . The 15 day forecast of Brent volume indicates short term fluctuations, with a peak around day 4, a decline until day 8, a rise near day 10, and a downward trend toward day 15, accompanied by prediction intervals.By integrating time series similarity measures with machine learning based forecasting, this study provides a novel framework for converting low frequency macroeconomic indicators into high frequency, actionable signals. The approach enables real time monitoring of the Energy Security Index, offering policymakers and analysts a scalable and practical tool to respond more rapidly to fast changing policy and market conditions, especially in data scarce environments.

Abstract: Diversified distribution matching (DDM) finds a unified translation function mapping a diverse collection of conditional source distributions to their target counterparts. DDM was proposed to resolve content misalignment issues in unpaired domain translation, achieving translation identifiability. However, DDM has only been implemented using GANs due to its constraints on the translation function. GANs are often unstable to train and do not provide the transport trajectory information -- yet such trajectories are useful in applications such as single-cell evolution analysis and robot route planning. This work introduces diversified flow matching (DFM), an ODE-based framework for DDM. Adapting flow matching (FM) to enforce a unified translation function as in DDM is challenging, as FM learns the translation function's velocity rather than the translation function itself. A custom bilevel optimization-based training loss, a nonlinear interpolant, and a structural reformulation are proposed to address these challenges, offering a tangible implementation. To our knowledge, DFM is the first ODE-based approach guaranteeing translation identifiability. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the proposed method.

Abstract: Test-time scaling through reward-guided generation remains largely unexplored for discrete diffusion models despite its potential as a promising alternative. In this work, we introduce Iterative Reward-Guided Refinement (IterRef), a novel test-time scaling method tailored to discrete diffusion that leverages reward-guided noising-denoising transitions to progressively refine misaligned intermediate states. We formalize this process within a Multiple-Try Metropolis (MTM) framework, proving convergence to the reward-aligned distribution. Unlike prior methods that assume the current state is already aligned with the reward distribution and only guide the subsequent transition, our approach explicitly refines each state in situ, progressively steering it toward the optimal intermediate distribution. Across both text and image domains, we evaluate IterRef on diverse discrete diffusion models and observe consistent improvements in reward-guided generation quality. In particular, IterRef achieves striking gains under low compute budgets, far surpassing prior state-of-the-art baselines.

Method: 将采样重新定义为在所有可能解掩码顺序上的路径选择，包含路径生成器（从解掩码集合池中采样提出路径）和验证器（计算路径不确定性并进行重要性采样选择最终路径）。

Result: 在数学、规划和编码等六个基准测试中实现一致性能提升，仅需2-3条路径即可达到峰值性能。LLaDA基础模型配合LookUM可匹敌RL调优的LLaDA 1.5性能。

Conclusion: 基于不确定性的验证为强化学习提供正交收益，证明了该框架的通用性，错误解掩码会显著增加序列级不确定性，该方法能有效避免错误倾向的轨迹。

Abstract: Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) as language models generate by iteratively unmasking tokens, yet their performance crucially depends on the inference time order of unmasking. Prevailing heuristics, such as confidence based sampling, are myopic: they optimize locally, fail to leverage extra test-time compute, and let early decoding mistakes cascade. We propose Lookahead Unmasking (LookUM), which addresses these concerns by reformulating sampling as path selection over all possible unmasking orders without the need for an external reward model. Our framework couples (i) a path generator that proposes paths by sampling from pools of unmasking sets with (ii) a verifier that computes the uncertainty of the proposed paths and performs importance sampling to subsequently select the final paths. Empirically, erroneous unmasking measurably inflates sequence level uncertainty, and our method exploits this to avoid error-prone trajectories. We validate our framework across six benchmarks, such as mathematics, planning, and coding, and demonstrate consistent performance improvements. LookUM requires only two to three paths to achieve peak performance, demonstrating remarkably efficient path selection. The consistent improvements on both LLaDA and post-trained LLaDA 1.5 are particularly striking: base LLaDA with LookUM rivals the performance of RL-tuned LLaDA 1.5, while LookUM further enhances LLaDA 1.5 itself showing that uncertainty based verification provides orthogonal benefits to reinforcement learning and underscoring the versatility of our framework. Code will be publicly released.

Abstract: Distribution shifts and minority subpopulations frequently undermine the reliability of deep neural networks trained using Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM). Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) addresses this by optimizing for the worst-case risk within a neighborhood of the training distribution. However, conventional methods depend on a single, global robustness budget, which can lead to overly conservative models or a misallocation of robustness. We propose a variance-driven, adaptive, sample-level DRO (Var-DRO) framework that automatically identifies high-risk training samples and assigns a personalized robustness budget to each based on its online loss variance. Our formulation employs two-sided, KL-divergence-style bounds to constrain the ratio between adversarial and empirical weights for every sample. This results in a linear inner maximization problem over a convex polytope, which admits an efficient water-filling solution. To stabilize training, we introduce a warmup phase and a linear ramp schedule for the global cap on per-sample budgets, complemented by label smoothing for numerical robustness. Evaluated on CIFAR-10-C (corruptions), our method achieves the highest overall mean accuracy compared to ERM and KL-DRO. On Waterbirds, Var-DRO improves overall performance while matching or surpassing KL-DRO. On the original CIFAR-10 dataset, Var-DRO remains competitive, exhibiting the modest trade-off anticipated when prioritizing robustness. The proposed framework is unsupervised (requiring no group labels), straightforward to implement, theoretically sound, and computationally efficient.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of jet fuel demand is crucial for optimizing supply chain operations in the aviation market. Fuel distributors specifically require precise estimates to avoid inventory shortages or excesses. However, there is a lack of studies that analyze the jet fuel demand forecasting problem using machine learning models. Instead, many industry practitioners rely on deterministic or expertise-based models. In this research, we evaluate the performance of data-driven approaches using a substantial amount of data obtained from a major aviation fuel distributor in the Danish market. Our analysis compares the predictive capabilities of traditional time series models, Prophet, LSTM sequence-to-sequence neural networks, and hybrid models. A key challenge in developing these models is the required forecasting horizon, as fuel demand needs to be predicted for the next 30 days to optimize sourcing strategies. To ensure the reliability of the data-driven approaches and provide valuable insights to practitioners, we analyze three different datasets. The primary objective of this study is to present a comprehensive case study on jet fuel demand forecasting, demonstrating the advantages of employing data-driven models and highlighting the impact of incorporating additional variables in the predictive models.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong performance in tasks like visual question answering and multimodal text generation, but their effectiveness in scientific domains such as materials science remains limited. While some machine learning methods have addressed specific challenges in this field, there is still a lack of foundation models designed for broad tasks like polymer property prediction using multimodal data. In this work, we present a multimodal polymer dataset to fine-tune VLMs through instruction-tuning pairs and assess the impact of multimodality on prediction performance. Our fine-tuned models, using LoRA, outperform unimodal and baseline approaches, demonstrating the benefits of multimodal learning. Additionally, this approach reduces the need to train separate models for different properties, lowering deployment and maintenance costs.

Abstract: Real-Time Auction (RTA) Interception aims to filter out invalid or irrelevant traffic to enhance the integrity and reliability of downstream data. However, two key challenges remain: (i) the need for accurate estimation of traffic quality together with sufficiently high confidence in the model's predictions, typically addressed through uncertainty modeling, and (ii) the efficiency bottlenecks that such uncertainty modeling introduces in real-time applications due to repeated inference. To address these challenges, we propose DAUM, a joint modeling framework that integrates multi-objective learning with uncertainty modeling, yielding both traffic quality predictions and reliable confidence estimates. Building on DAUM, we further apply knowledge distillation to reduce the computational overhead of uncertainty modeling, while largely preserving predictive accuracy and retaining the benefits of uncertainty estimation. Experiments on the JD advertisement dataset demonstrate that DAUM consistently improves predictive performance, with the distilled model delivering a tenfold increase in inference speed.

Conclusion: 该研究显著扩展了神经核理论的现有格局，为深度学习和缩放定律提供了深入理解。

Abstract: While deep learning has achieved remarkable success across a wide range of applications, its theoretical understanding of representation learning remains limited. Deep neural kernels provide a principled framework to interpret over-parameterized neural networks by mapping hierarchical feature transformations into kernel spaces, thereby combining the expressive power of deep architectures with the analytical tractability of kernel methods. Recent advances, particularly neural tangent kernels (NTKs) derived by gradient inner products, have established connections between infinitely wide neural networks and nonparametric Bayesian inference. However, the existing NTK paradigm has been predominantly confined to the infinite-width regime, while overlooking the representational role of network depth. To address this gap, we propose a depth-induced NTK kernel based on a shortcut-related architecture, which converges to a Gaussian process as the network depth approaches infinity. We theoretically analyze the training invariance and spectrum properties of the proposed kernel, which stabilizes the kernel dynamics and mitigates degeneration. Experimental results further underscore the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our findings significantly extend the existing landscape of the neural kernel theory and provide an in-depth understanding of deep learning and the scaling law.

Conclusion: RED是一种通用、快速且易于扩展的后处理方法，能够有效提升各类方程发现系统的性能。

Abstract: Neural-guided equation discovery systems use a data set as prompt and predict an equation that describes the data set without extensive search. However, if the equation does not meet the user's expectations, there are few options for getting other equation suggestions without intensive work with the system. To fill this gap, we propose Residuals for Equation Discovery (RED), a post-processing method that improves a given equation in a targeted manner, based on its residuals. By parsing the initial equation to a syntax tree, we can use node-based calculation rules to compute the residual for each subequation of the initial equation. It is then possible to use this residual as new target variable in the original data set and generate a new prompt. If, with the new prompt, the equation discovery system suggests a subequation better than the old subequation on a validation set, we replace the latter by the former. RED is usable with any equation discovery system, is fast to calculate, and is easy to extend for new mathematical operations. In experiments on 53 equations from the Feynman benchmark, we show that it not only helps to improve all tested neural-guided systems, but also all tested classical genetic programming systems.

Conclusion: CoPRIS有效解决了LLM RL训练中的长尾效率问题，显著提升了训练速度而不牺牲模型性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training has become a trending paradigm for enhancing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Most existing RL systems for LLMs operate in a fully synchronous manner, where training must wait for the rollout of an entire batch to complete. This design leads to severe inefficiencies, as extremely long trajectories can stall the entire rollout process and leave many GPUs idle. To address this issue, we propose Concurrency- Controlled Partial Rollout with Importance Sampling (CoPRIS), which mitigates long-tail inefficiencies by maintaining a fixed number of concurrent rollouts, early-terminating once sufficient samples are collected, and reusing unfinished trajectories in subsequent rollouts. To mitigate the impact of off-policy trajectories, we introduce Cross-stage Importance Sampling Correction, which concatenates buffered log probabilities from the previous policy with those recomputed under the current policy for importance sampling correction. Experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that CoPRIS achieves up to 1.94x faster training while maintaining comparable or superior performance to synchronous RL systems. The code of CoPRIS is available at https://github.com/777pomingzi/CoPRIS.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized clients while preserving data privacy by keeping raw data local. However, FL suffers from significant communication overhead due to the frequent exchange of high-dimensional model updates over constrained networks. In this paper, we present FedSparQ, a lightweight compression framework that dynamically sparsifies the gradient of each client through an adaptive threshold, applies half-precision quantization to retained entries and integrates residuals from error feedback to prevent loss of information. FedSparQ requires no manual tuning of sparsity rates or quantization schedules, adapts seamlessly to both homogeneous and heterogeneous data distributions, and is agnostic to model architecture. Through extensive empirical evaluation on vision benchmarks under independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-IID data, we show that FedSparQ substantially reduces communication overhead (reducing by 90% of bytes sent compared to FedAvg) while preserving or improving model accuracy (improving by 6% compared to FedAvg non-compressed solution or to state-of-the-art compression models) and enhancing convergence robustness (by 50%, compared to the other baselines). Our approach provides a practical, easy-to-deploy solution for bandwidth-constrained federated deployments and lays the groundwork for future extensions in adaptive precision and privacy-preserving protocols.

Abstract: Inspired by the remarkable success of foundation models in language and vision, Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) hold significant promise for broad applicability across diverse graph tasks and domains. However, existing GFMs struggle with unstable few-shot fine-tuning, where both performance and adaptation efficiency exhibit significant fluctuations caused by the randomness in the support sample selection and structural discrepancies between the pre-trained and target graphs. How to fine-tune GFMs robustly and efficiently to enable trustworthy knowledge transfer across domains and tasks is the major challenge. In this paper, we propose GRAVER, a novel Generative gRAph VocabulariEs for Robust GFM fine-tuning framework that tackles the aforementioned instability via generative augmentations. Specifically, to identify transferable units, we analyze and extract key class-specific subgraph patterns by ego-graph disentanglement and validate their transferability both theoretically and empirically. To enable effective pre-training across diverse domains, we leverage a universal task template based on ego-graph similarity and construct graph vocabularies via graphon-based generative experts. To facilitate robust and efficient prompt fine-tuning, we grave the support samples with in-context vocabularies, where the lightweight MoE-CoE network attentively routes knowledge from source domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of GRAVER over effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency on downstream few-shot node and graph classification tasks compared with 15 state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: In the era of smart manufacturing, predictive maintenance (PdM) plays a pivotal role in improving equipment reliability and reducing operating costs. In this paper, we propose a novel Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework that integrates advanced soft computing techniques - Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), Denoising Autoencoder (DAE), Graph Neural Network (GNN), and Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) - to address the multidimensional challenges of predictive maintenance in complex manufacturing systems. Specifically, the proposed framework innovatively combines the powerful frequency-domain representation capability of FNOs to capture high-dimensional temporal patterns; DAEs to achieve robust, noise-resistant latent state embedding from complex non-Gaussian sensor data; and GNNs to accurately represent inter-device dependencies for coordinated system-wide maintenance decisions. Furthermore, by exploiting PPO, the framework ensures stable and efficient optimisation of long-term maintenance strategies to effectively handle uncertainty and non-stationary dynamics. Experimental validation demonstrates that the approach significantly outperforms multiple deep learning baseline models with up to 13% cost reduction, as well as strong convergence and inter-module synergy. The framework has considerable industrial potential to effectively reduce downtime and operating expenses through data-driven strategies.

Abstract: Accurately modeling complex dynamic spatio-temporal systems requires capturing flow-mediated interdependencies and context-sensitive interaction dynamics. Existing methods, predominantly graph-based or attention-driven, rely on similarity-driven connectivity assumptions, neglecting asymmetric flow exchanges that govern system evolution. We propose Spatio-Temporal Flow, a physics-inspired paradigm that explicitly models dynamic node couplings through quantifiable flow transfers governed by conservation principles. Building on this, we design FlowNet, a novel architecture leveraging flow tokens as information carriers to simulate source-to-destination transfers via Flow Allocation Modules, ensuring state redistribution aligns with conservation laws. FlowNet dynamically adjusts the interaction radius through an Adaptive Spatial Masking module, suppressing irrelevant noise while enabling context-aware propagation. A cascaded architecture enhances scalability and nonlinear representation capacity. Experiments demonstrate that FlowNet significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on seven metrics in the modeling of three real-world systems, validating its efficiency and physical interpretability. We establish a principled methodology for modeling complex systems through spatio-temporal flow interactions.

Conclusion: AutoHood3D支持物理感知的机器学习开发，加速生成设计迭代，并促进新的流体-结构相互作用基准的创建。

Abstract: This study presents a new high-fidelity multi-modal dataset containing 16000+ geometric variants of automotive hoods useful for machine learning (ML) applications such as engineering component design and process optimization, and multiphysics system surrogates. The dataset is centered on a practical multiphysics problem-hood deformation from fluid entrapment and inertial loading during rotary-dip painting. Each hood is numerically modeled with a coupled Large-Eddy Simulation (LES)-Finite Element Analysis (FEA), using 1.2M cells in total to ensure spatial and temporal accuracy. The dataset provides time-resolved physical fields, along with STL meshes and structured natural language prompts for text-to-geometry synthesis. Existing datasets are either confined to 2D cases, exhibit limited geometric variations, or lack the multi-modal annotations and data structures - shortcomings we address with AutoHood3D. We validate our numerical methodology, establish quantitative baselines across five neural architectures, and demonstrate systematic surrogate errors in displacement and force predictions. These findings motivate the design of novel approaches and multiphysics loss functions that enforce fluid-solid coupling during model training. By providing fully reproducible workflows, AutoHood3D enables physics-aware ML development, accelerates generative-design iteration, and facilitates the creation of new FSI benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FiCABU是一个软硬件协同设计的边缘AI处理器机器学习遗忘方案，通过上下文自适应遗忘和平衡阻尼技术，在保持保留准确性的同时实现高效遗忘，计算量减少高达87.52%，能耗降至基线的6.48%甚至0.13%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受隐私法规和"被遗忘权"驱动，边缘设备需要机器学习遗忘功能，但服务器中心化或重训练方法在计算和能耗受限的边缘环境中不实用。

Method: 结合上下文自适应遗忘（从后端层开始编辑，达到目标遗忘即停止）和平衡阻尼（按深度缩放阻尼强度以保持保留准确性），在RISC-V边缘AI处理器中实现软硬件协同设计。

Result: 在CIFAR-20和PinsFaceRecognition数据集上，FiCABU实现随机猜测遗忘准确性，同时匹配SSD基线的保留准确性，计算量减少87.52%（ResNet-18）和71.03%（ViT），硬件原型能耗降至基线的6.48%和0.13%。

Conclusion: FiCABU证明后端优先、深度感知的遗忘方法可以在资源受限的边缘AI设备上实现实用且高效的机器学习遗忘。

Abstract: Machine unlearning, driven by privacy regulations and the "right to be forgotten", is increasingly needed at the edge, yet server-centric or retraining-heavy methods are impractical under tight computation and energy budgets. We present FiCABU (Fisher-based Context-Adaptive Balanced Unlearning), a software-hardware co-design that brings unlearning to edge AI processors. FiCABU combines (i) Context-Adaptive Unlearning, which begins edits from back-end layers and halts once the target forgetting is reached, with (ii) Balanced Dampening, which scales dampening strength by depth to preserve retain accuracy. These methods are realized in a full RTL design of a RISC-V edge AI processor that integrates two lightweight IPs for Fisher estimation and dampening into a GEMM-centric streaming pipeline, validated on an FPGA prototype and synthesized in 45 nm for power analysis. Across CIFAR-20 and PinsFaceRecognition with ResNet-18 and ViT, FiCABU achieves random-guess forget accuracy while matching the retraining-free Selective Synaptic Dampening (SSD) baseline on retain accuracy, reducing computation by up to 87.52 percent (ResNet-18) and 71.03 percent (ViT). On the INT8 hardware prototype, FiCABU further improves retain preservation and reduces energy to 6.48 percent (CIFAR-20) and 0.13 percent (PinsFaceRecognition) of the SSD baseline. In sum, FiCABU demonstrates that back-end-first, depth-aware unlearning can be made both practical and efficient for resource-constrained edge AI devices.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合LSTM预测和保形预测的自适应框架，用于水分配网络数字孪生中的状态估计，通过节点级不确定性评估来优化传感器部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水分配网络数字孪生需要准确的状态估计，但传感器有限。均匀采样在不同不确定性节点间浪费资源，需要更智能的采样策略。

Method: 使用LSTM进行预测，结合保形预测（特别是边际保形预测）来估计节点级不确定性，将感知资源集中在最不确定的节点上。

Result: 在Hanoi、Net3和CTOWN数据集上，在40%覆盖率下比均匀采样降低33-34%的需求误差，同时保持89.4-90.2%的经验覆盖率，仅增加5-10%的计算开销。

Conclusion: 该自适应框架能有效优化水分配网络数字孪生的状态估计精度，在有限传感器下实现更好的性能，且计算成本可控。

Abstract: Digital Twins (DTs) for Water Distribution Networks (WDNs) require accurate state estimation with limited sensors. Uniform sampling often wastes resources across nodes with different uncertainty. We propose an adaptive framework combining LSTM forecasting and Conformal Prediction (CP) to estimate node-wise uncertainty and focus sensing on the most uncertain points. Marginal CP is used for its low computational cost, suitable for real-time DTs. Experiments on Hanoi, Net3, and CTOWN show 33-34% lower demand error than uniform sampling at 40% coverage and maintain 89.4-90.2% empirical coverage with only 5-10% extra computation.

Abstract: Scientific machine learning research spans diverse domains and data modalities, yet existing benchmark efforts remain siloed and lack standardization. This makes novel and transformative applications of machine learning to critical scientific use-cases more fragmented and less clear in pathways to impact. This paper introduces an ontology for scientific benchmarking developed through a unified, community-driven effort that extends the MLCommons ecosystem to cover physics, chemistry, materials science, biology, climate science, and more. Building on prior initiatives such as XAI-BENCH, FastML Science Benchmarks, PDEBench, and the SciMLBench framework, our effort consolidates a large set of disparate benchmarks and frameworks into a single taxonomy of scientific, application, and system-level benchmarks. New benchmarks can be added through an open submission workflow coordinated by the MLCommons Science Working Group and evaluated against a six-category rating rubric that promotes and identifies high-quality benchmarks, enabling stakeholders to select benchmarks that meet their specific needs. The architecture is extensible, supporting future scientific and AI/ML motifs, and we discuss methods for identifying emerging computing patterns for unique scientific workloads. The MLCommons Science Benchmarks Ontology provides a standardized, scalable foundation for reproducible, cross-domain benchmarking in scientific machine learning. A companion webpage for this work has also been developed as the effort evolves: https://mlcommons-science.github.io/benchmark/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习在硬件中的实现增加，硬件合成等过程成为设计迭代的限制因素，需要开发基于ML的代理模型来估计ML加速器架构的资源使用。

Method: 创建了包含68万多个全连接和卷积神经网络的基准数据集，使用hls4ml合成并针对Xilinx FPGA。引入了基于GNN和transformer的代理模型来预测延迟和资源。

Conclusion: wa-hls4ml基准测试和提出的代理模型能够有效预测ML加速器的资源和延迟，有助于缓解硬件合成成为设计迭代瓶颈的问题。

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) is increasingly implemented in hardware to address real-time challenges in scientific applications, the development of advanced toolchains has significantly reduced the time required to iterate on various designs. These advancements have solved major obstacles, but also exposed new challenges. For example, processes that were not previously considered bottlenecks, such as hardware synthesis, are becoming limiting factors in the rapid iteration of designs. To mitigate these emerging constraints, multiple efforts have been undertaken to develop an ML-based surrogate model that estimates resource usage of ML accelerator architectures. We introduce wa-hls4ml, a benchmark for ML accelerator resource and latency estimation, and its corresponding initial dataset of over 680,000 fully connected and convolutional neural networks, all synthesized using hls4ml and targeting Xilinx FPGAs. The benchmark evaluates the performance of resource and latency predictors against several common ML model architectures, primarily originating from scientific domains, as exemplar models, and the average performance across a subset of the dataset. Additionally, we introduce GNN- and transformer-based surrogate models that predict latency and resources for ML accelerators. We present the architecture and performance of the models and find that the models generally predict latency and resources for the 75% percentile within several percent of the synthesized resources on the synthetic test dataset.

Motivation: 尽管时间序列基础模型在公开基准测试中表现良好，但其在工业环境中的有效性仍不确定，需要研究其泛化失败的原因。

Method: 通过工业规模的移动游戏玩家参与度预测任务进行实证分析，并设计受控合成实验对比已见和未见频率带的信号。

Result: 发现时间序列基础模型在频谱不匹配情况下系统性地性能下降，在工业任务中表现不如领域适应的基线方法。

Conclusion: 频率感知对于稳健的时间序列基础模型部署至关重要，需要开发考虑频谱多样性的新预训练和评估协议。

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) have shown strong results on public benchmarks, prompting comparisons to a "BERT moment" for time series. Their effectiveness in industrial settings, however, remains uncertain. We examine why TSFMs often struggle to generalize and highlight spectral shift (a mismatch between the dominant frequency components in downstream tasks and those represented during pretraining) as a key factor. We present evidence from an industrial-scale player engagement prediction task in mobile gaming, where TSFMs underperform domain-adapted baselines. To isolate the mechanism, we design controlled synthetic experiments contrasting signals with seen versus unseen frequency bands, observing systematic degradation under spectral mismatch. These findings position frequency awareness as critical for robust TSFM deployment and motivate new pretraining and evaluation protocols that explicitly account for spectral diversity.

Conclusion: 信念惯性方法可以成为推导非平稳老虎机中尖锐下界的强大工具，即使周期性重启算法也无法避免线性遗憾。

Abstract: We study the problem of worst case regret in piecewise stationary multi armed bandits. While the minimax theory for stationary bandits is well established, understanding analogous limits in time-varying settings is challenging. Existing lower bounds rely on what we refer to as infrequent sampling arguments, where long intervals without exploration allow adversarial reward changes that induce large regret.
  In this paper, we introduce a fundamentally different approach based on a belief inertia argument. Our analysis captures how an algorithm's empirical beliefs, encoded through historical reward averages, create momentum that resists new evidence after a change. We show how this inertia can be exploited to construct adversarial instances that mislead classical algorithms such as Explore Then Commit, epsilon greedy, and UCB, causing them to suffer regret that grows linearly with T and with a substantial constant factor, regardless of how their parameters are tuned, even with a single change point.
  We extend the analysis to algorithms that periodically restart to handle non stationarity and prove that, even then, the worst case regret remains linear in T. Our results indicate that utilizing belief inertia can be a powerful method for deriving sharp lower bounds in non stationary bandits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络特别是ReLU网络的复杂性使其内部学习机制难以理解，需要新的分析框架来揭示表示学习的本质

Method: 将多层ReLU网络重铸为等效单层线性模型，通过ReLU激活模式创建的计算路径推导出输入依赖的有效权重矩阵W_eff(x)

Result: 训练过程中，同一类别样本的有效权重会收敛，不同类别样本的有效权重会发散，有效权重轨迹揭示了类别特定决策边界的形成

Conclusion: 有效权重的演化揭示了表示学习的基本原理，为理解网络内部语义表示的出现提供了新的视角

Abstract: Deep neural networks, particularly those employing Rectified Linear Units (ReLU), are often perceived as complex, high-dimensional, non-linear systems. This complexity poses a significant challenge to understanding their internal learning mechanisms. In this work, we propose a novel analytical framework that recasts a multi-layer ReLU network into an equivalent single-layer linear model with input-dependent "effective weights". For any given input sample, the activation pattern of ReLU units creates a unique computational path, effectively zeroing out a subset of weights in the network. By composing the active weights across all layers, we can derive an effective weight matrix, $W_{\text{eff}}(x)$, that maps the input directly to the output for that specific sample. We posit that the evolution of these effective weights reveals fundamental principles of representation learning. Our work demonstrates that as training progresses, the effective weights corresponding to samples from the same class converge, while those from different classes diverge. By tracking the trajectories of these sample-wise effective weights, we provide a new lens through which to interpret the formation of class-specific decision boundaries and the emergence of semantic representations within the network.

TL;DR: 提出了SSTODE框架，一种基于物理信息的神经常微分方程方法，用于海表温度预测，通过结合流体输运原理和能量交换机制，在保持物理一致性的同时提高预测精度和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据驱动模型在SST预测中缺乏可解释性且忽视关键物理过程，而现有物理信息神经网络难以处理复杂的海气相互作用，特别是海水运动和外部驱动因素的整合不足。

Method: 从流体输运原理推导ODE，结合平流和扩散模拟海洋时空动态；通过变分优化恢复控制SST时间动态的潜速度场；引入基于海洋热收支方程的EEI模块整合外部强迫因素。

Conclusion: SSTODE不仅实现了优异的预测性能，还通过物理一致的建模提供了对SST动态的深入理解，证明了模型的可解释性和物理一致性。

Abstract: Sea Surface Temperature (SST) is crucial for understanding upper-ocean thermal dynamics and ocean-atmosphere interactions, which have profound economic and social impacts. While data-driven models show promise in SST prediction, their black-box nature often limits interpretability and overlooks key physical processes. Recently, physics-informed neural networks have been gaining momentum but struggle with complex ocean-atmosphere dynamics due to 1) inadequate characterization of seawater movement (e.g., coastal upwelling) and 2) insufficient integration of external SST drivers (e.g., turbulent heat fluxes). To address these challenges, we propose SSTODE, a physics-informed Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) framework for SST prediction. First, we derive ODEs from fluid transport principles, incorporating both advection and diffusion to model ocean spatiotemporal dynamics. Through variational optimization, we recover a latent velocity field that explicitly governs the temporal dynamics of SST. Building upon ODE, we introduce an Energy Exchanges Integrator (EEI)-inspired by ocean heat budget equations-to account for external forcing factors. Thus, the variations in the components of these factors provide deeper insights into SST dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSTODE achieves state-of-the-art performances in global and regional SST forecasting benchmarks. Furthermore, SSTODE visually reveals the impact of advection dynamics, thermal diffusion patterns, and diurnal heating-cooling cycles on SST evolution. These findings demonstrate the model's interpretability and physical consistency.

Motivation: 湍流演化预测在科学和工程中至关重要，但现有湍流模型的简化会引入认知不确定性。Eigenspace扰动方法(EPM)是广泛使用的物理基础方法，但纯物理基础的方法可能会高估不确定性边界。

Method: 提出基于卷积神经网络(CNN)的EPM扰动幅度调制方法，构建混合机器学习-EPM框架，在保持物理一致性的同时改进校准。

Result: 在典型测试案例中，混合ML-EPM框架相比基线EPM方法产生了显著更紧致、更好校准的不确定性估计。

Conclusion: 混合机器学习-物理方法能够有效改进湍流模型的不确定性量化，提供更准确的不确定性边界估计。

Abstract: Predicting the evolution of turbulent flows is central across science and engineering. Most studies rely on simulations with turbulence models, whose empirical simplifications introduce epistemic uncertainty. The Eigenspace Perturbation Method (EPM) is a widely used physics-based approach to quantify model-form uncertainty, but being purely physics-based it can overpredict uncertainty bounds. We propose a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based modulation of EPM perturbation magnitudes to improve calibration while preserving physical consistency. Across canonical cases, the hybrid ML-EPM framework yields substantially tighter, better-calibrated uncertainty estimates than baseline EPM alone.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的逆博弈理论方法假设代理的理性参数τ已知，但当τ未知时会产生尺度模糊性，使得奖励参数θ和τ统计上不可识别。

Method: 引入归一化约束解决尺度模糊性，提出归一化最小二乘估计器，并扩展到马尔可夫博弈中。

Result: 证明了NLS估计器在联合参数恢复中达到最优的O(N^{-1/2})收敛速率，在强可识别性条件失败时提供部分识别保证。

Conclusion: Blind-IGT框架有效解决了逆博弈理论中的参数识别问题，即使在未知转移动态的情况下也表现出强大的经验性能。

Abstract: Inverse Game Theory (IGT) methods based on the entropy-regularized Quantal Response Equilibrium (QRE) offer a tractable approach for competitive settings, but critically assume the agents' rationality parameter (temperature $τ$) is known a priori. When $τ$ is unknown, a fundamental scale ambiguity emerges that couples $τ$ with the reward parameters ($θ$), making them statistically unidentifiable. We introduce Blind-IGT, the first statistical framework to jointly recover both $θ$ and $τ$ from observed behavior. We analyze this bilinear inverse problem and establish necessary and sufficient conditions for unique identification by introducing a normalization constraint that resolves the scale ambiguity. We propose an efficient Normalized Least Squares (NLS) estimator and prove it achieves the optimal $\mathcal{O}(N^{-1/2})$ convergence rate for joint parameter recovery. When strong identifiability conditions fail, we provide partial identification guarantees through confidence set construction. We extend our framework to Markov games and demonstrate optimal convergence rates with strong empirical performance even when transition dynamics are unknown.

Conclusion: KLASS是一种快速有效的采样方法，可作为跨不同模型的通用采样器，在保持质量的同时显著加速生成过程。

Abstract: Masked diffusion models have demonstrated competitive results on various tasks including language generation. However, due to its iterative refinement process, the inference is often bottlenecked by slow and static sampling speed. To overcome this problem, we introduce `KL-Adaptive Stability Sampling' (KLASS), a fast yet effective sampling method that exploits token-level KL divergence to identify stable, high-confidence predictions. By unmasking multiple tokens in each iteration without any additional model training, our approach speeds up generation significantly while maintaining sample quality. On reasoning benchmarks, KLASS achieves up to $2.78\times$ wall-clock speedups while improving performance over standard greedy decoding, attaining state-of-the-art results among diffusion-based samplers. We further validate KLASS across diverse domains, including text, image, and molecular generation, showing its effectiveness as a broadly applicable sampler across different models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习策略在受控环境中训练后，在真实环境部署时经常因分布偏移而失效。DRRL通过优化不确定性集合内的最坏情况性能来解决此问题，但固定ε会导致性能与鲁棒性之间的权衡问题。

Method: DR-SPCRL将鲁棒性预算ε视为连续课程，根据智能体进度自适应调度鲁棒性预算，实现名义性能和鲁棒性能的平衡。

Result: 在多个环境中的实证结果表明，DR-SPCRL不仅稳定了训练，还实现了优越的鲁棒性-性能权衡，在不同扰动下平均获得11.8%的回合回报提升，性能约为相应名义RL算法的1.9倍。

Conclusion: DR-SPCRL通过自适应调度鲁棒性预算，有效解决了DRRL中固定ε带来的权衡问题，实现了更好的鲁棒性和性能平衡。

Abstract: A central challenge in reinforcement learning is that policies trained in controlled environments often fail under distribution shifts at deployment into real-world environments. Distributionally Robust Reinforcement Learning (DRRL) addresses this by optimizing for worst-case performance within an uncertainty set defined by a robustness budget $ε$. However, fixing $ε$ results in a tradeoff between performance and robustness: small values yield high nominal performance but weak robustness, while large values can result in instability and overly conservative policies. We propose Distributionally Robust Self-Paced Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (DR-SPCRL), a method that overcomes this limitation by treating $ε$ as a continuous curriculum. DR-SPCRL adaptively schedules the robustness budget according to the agent's progress, enabling a balance between nominal and robust performance. Empirical results across multiple environments demonstrate that DR-SPCRL not only stabilizes training but also achieves a superior robustness-performance trade-off, yielding an average 11.8\% increase in episodic return under varying perturbations compared to fixed or heuristic scheduling strategies, and achieving approximately 1.9$\times$ the performance of the corresponding nominal RL algorithms.

MSK-MATCH integrates a large language model with a curated oncology trial knowledge base and retrieval-augmented architecture providing explanations for all AI predictions grounded in source text. In a retrospective dataset of 88,518 clinical documents from 731 patients across six breast cancer trials, MSK-MATCH automatically resolved 61.9% of cases and triaged 38.1% for human review. This AI-assisted workflow achieved 98.6% accuracy, 98.4% sensitivity, and 98.7% specificity for patient-level eligibility classification, matching or exceeding performance of the human-only and AI-only comparisons. For the triaged cases requiring manual review, prepopulating eligibility screens with AI-generated explanations reduced screening time from 20 minutes to 43 seconds at an average cost of $0.96 per patient-trial pair.

They utilize their pre-trained knowledge to adapt to new domains, achieving commendable performance with only a few training examples, also called the few-shot regime. However, the performance gain in the few-shot regime comes at the expense of significantly increased complexity and number of parameters. To circumvent this trade-off, we introduce TabDistill, a new strategy to distill the pre-trained knowledge in complex transformer-based models into simpler neural networks for effectively classifying tabular data. Our framework yields the best of both worlds: being parameter-efficient while performing well with limited training data. The distilled neural networks surpass classical baselines such as regular neural networks, XGBoost and logistic regression under equal training data, and in some cases, even the original transformer-based models that they were distilled from.

Abstract: We consider the problem of distributionally robust multimodal machine learning. Existing approaches often rely on merging modalities on the feature level (early fusion) or heuristic uncertainty modeling, which downplays modality-aware effects and provide limited insights. We propose a novel distributionally robust optimization (DRO) framework that aims to study both the theoretical and practical insights of multimodal machine learning. We first justify this setup and show the significance of this problem through complexity analysis. We then establish both generalization upper bounds and minimax lower bounds which provide performance guarantees. These results are further extended in settings where we consider encoder-specific error propogations. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach improves robustness in both simulation settings and real-world datasets. Together, these findings provide a principled foundation for employing multimodal machine learning models in high-stakes applications where uncertainty is unavoidable.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GastroDL-Fusion是一个双模态深度学习框架，整合蛋白质-配体复合物数据和疾病相关基因序列信息，用于胃肠道疾病的药物和疫苗开发，显著提高了结合亲和力预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统计算模型仅依赖结构信息，无法捕捉影响疾病机制和治疗反应的遗传决定因素，因此需要整合结构和遗传特征来更准确地预测蛋白质-配体结合亲和力。

Method: 使用图同构网络(GIN)建模蛋白质-配体复合物的分子图表示，通过预训练Transformer(ProtBERT/ESM)将基因序列编码为生物意义嵌入，通过多层感知机融合这两种互补模态以实现跨模态交互学习。

Result: 在胃肠道疾病相关靶点的基准数据集上，GastroDL-Fusion显著优于传统方法，平均绝对误差(MAE)为1.12，均方根误差(RMSE)为1.75，优于CNN、BiLSTM、GIN和Transformer-only基线模型。

Conclusion: 整合结构和遗传特征能够更准确地预测结合亲和力，为加速胃肠道疾病靶向治疗和疫苗设计提供了可靠的计算工具。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding affinity plays a pivotal role in accelerating the discovery of novel drugs and vaccines, particularly for gastrointestinal (GI) diseases such as gastric ulcers, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. Traditional computational models often rely on structural information alone and thus fail to capture the genetic determinants that influence disease mechanisms and therapeutic responses. To address this gap, we propose GastroDL-Fusion, a dual-modal deep learning framework that integrates protein-ligand complex data with disease-associated gene sequence information for drug and vaccine development. In our approach, protein-ligand complexes are represented as molecular graphs and modeled using a Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN), while gene sequences are encoded into biologically meaningful embeddings via a pre-trained Transformer (ProtBERT/ESM). These complementary modalities are fused through a multi-layer perceptron to enable robust cross-modal interaction learning. We evaluate the model on benchmark datasets of GI disease-related targets, demonstrating that GastroDL-Fusion significantly improves predictive performance over conventional methods. Specifically, the model achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.12 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.75, outperforming CNN, BiLSTM, GIN, and Transformer-only baselines. These results confirm that incorporating both structural and genetic features yields more accurate predictions of binding affinities, providing a reliable computational tool for accelerating the design of targeted therapies and vaccines in the context of gastrointestinal diseases.

Abstract: We introduce the first formal large-scale assessment of the utility of traditional chemical functional groups as used in chemical explanations. Our assessment employs a fundamental principle from computational learning theory: a good explanation of data should also compress the data. We introduce an unsupervised learning algorithm based on the Minimum Message Length (MML) principle that searches for substructures that compress around three million biologically relevant molecules. We demonstrate that the discovered substructures contain most human-curated functional groups as well as novel larger patterns with more specific functions. We also run our algorithm on 24 specific bioactivity prediction datasets to discover dataset-specific functional groups. Fingerprints constructed from dataset-specific functional groups are shown to significantly outperform other fingerprint representations, including the MACCS and Morgan fingerprint, when training ridge regression models on bioactivity regression tasks.

Conclusion: QiVC框架展示了在真实世界生物医学信号分析中推进不确定性感知建模的潜力。

Abstract: This work introduces the quantum-inspired variational convolution (QiVC) framework, a novel learning paradigm that integrates principles of probabilistic inference, variational optimization, and quantum-inspired transformations within convolutional architectures. The central innovation of QiVC lies in its quantum-inspired rotated ensemble (QiRE) mechanism. QiRE performs differentiable low-dimensional subspace rotations of convolutional weights, analogously to quantum state evolution. This approach enables structured uncertainty modeling while preserving the intrinsic geometry of the parameter space, resulting in more expressive, stable, and uncertainty-aware representations. To demonstrate its practical potential, the concept is instantiated in a QiVC-based convolutional network (QiVC-Net) and evaluated in the context of biosignal classification, focusing on phonocardiogram (PCG) recordings, a challenging domain characterized by high noise, inter-subject variability, and often imbalanced data. The proposed QiVC-Net integrates an architecture in which the QiVC layer does not introduce additional parameters, instead performing an ensemble rotation of the convolutional weights through a structured mechanism ensuring robustness without added highly computational burden. Experiments on two benchmark datasets, PhysioNet CinC 2016 and PhysioNet CirCor DigiScope 2022, show that QiVC-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching accuracies of 97.84% and 97.89%, respectively. These findings highlight the versatility of the QiVC framework and its promise for advancing uncertainty-aware modeling in real-world biomedical signal analysis. The implementation of the QiVConv layer is openly available in GitHub.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为PartiBandits的主动学习算法，用于在有限标签数量下高效估计多类别随机变量的均值，该算法结合了UCB和基于分歧的主动学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在标签数量有限但拥有辅助信息（协变量）的情况下，如何高效估计随机变量的均值是一个重要问题。

Method: PartiBandits是一个两阶段算法：第一阶段学习未标记数据的划分以减少Y的条件方差；第二阶段使用WarmStart-UCB子程序按轮次从每个层请求标签。

Result: 算法估计的均方误差为$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left( \frac{ν+ \exp(c \cdot (-N/\log(N))) }{N} \right)$，其中ν是贝叶斯最优分类器的风险，在经典设置下达到极小极大最优收敛率。

Conclusion: PartiBandits成功桥接了UCB和基于分歧的主动学习方法，并在电子健康记录模拟中验证了有效性，提供了R语言实现包。

Abstract: We study the problem of efficiently estimating the mean of a $k$-class random variable, $Y$, using a limited number of labels, $N$, in settings where the analyst has access to auxiliary information (i.e.: covariates) $X$ that may be informative about $Y$. We propose an active learning algorithm ("PartiBandits") to estimate $\mathbb{E}[Y]$. The algorithm yields an estimate, $\widehatμ_{\text{PB}}$, such that $\left( \widehatμ_{\text{PB}} - \mathbb{E}[Y]\right)^2$ is $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left( \frac{ν+ \exp(c \cdot (-N/\log(N))) }{N} \right)$, where $c > 0$ is a constant and $ν$ is the risk of the Bayes-optimal classifier. PartiBandits is essentially a two-stage algorithm. In the first stage, it learns a partition of the unlabeled data that shrinks the average conditional variance of $Y$. In the second stage it uses a UCB-style subroutine ("WarmStart-UCB") to request labels from each stratum round-by-round. Both the main algorithm's and the subroutine's convergence rates are minimax optimal in classical settings. PartiBandits bridges the UCB and disagreement-based approaches to active learning despite these two approaches being designed to tackle very different tasks. We illustrate our methods through simulation using nationwide electronic health records. Our methods can be implemented using the PartiBandits package in R.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏自编码器在解释大语言模型时面临可解释性与效率的矛盾：高维隐藏层满足稀疏性约束但带来高昂的计算成本，而现有MoE方法中专家缺乏专业化，学习重叠特征。

Method: 提出两个关键创新：(1) 多专家激活机制，同时激活语义加权的专家子集以促进专业化；(2) 特征缩放技术，通过自适应高频缩放增强特征多样性。

Result: 实验显示重构误差降低24%，特征冗余减少99%，相比现有MoE-SAE方法有显著改进。

Conclusion: 这项工作弥合了LLM分析中的可解释性-效率差距，实现了透明模型检查而不损害计算可行性。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a powerful tool for interpreting large language models (LLMs) by decomposing token activations into combinations of human-understandable features. While SAEs provide crucial insights into LLM explanations, their practical adoption faces a fundamental challenge: better interpretability demands that SAEs' hidden layers have high dimensionality to satisfy sparsity constraints, resulting in prohibitive training and inference costs. Recent Mixture of Experts (MoE) approaches attempt to address this by partitioning SAEs into narrower expert networks with gated activation, thereby reducing computation. In a well-designed MoE, each expert should focus on learning a distinct set of features. However, we identify a \textit{critical limitation} in MoE-SAE: Experts often fail to specialize, which means they frequently learn overlapping or identical features. To deal with it, we propose two key innovations: (1) Multiple Expert Activation that simultaneously engages semantically weighted expert subsets to encourage specialization, and (2) Feature Scaling that enhances diversity through adaptive high-frequency scaling. Experiments demonstrate a 24\% lower reconstruction error and a 99\% reduction in feature redundancy compared to existing MoE-SAE methods. This work bridges the interpretability-efficiency gap in LLM analysis, allowing transparent model inspection without compromising computational feasibility.

Abstract: In this work, we study the problem of finding robust and safe policies in Robust Constrained Average-Cost Markov Decision Processes (RCMDPs). A key challenge in this setting is the lack of strong duality, which prevents the direct use of standard primal-dual methods for constrained RL. Additional difficulties arise from the average-cost setting, where the Robust Bellman operator is not a contraction under any norm. To address these challenges, we propose an actor-critic algorithm for Average-Cost RCMDPs. We show that our method achieves both \(ε\)-feasibility and \(ε\)-optimality, and we establish a sample complexities of \(\tilde{O}\left(ε^{-4}\right)\) and \(\tilde{O}\left(ε^{-6}\right)\) with and without slackness assumption, which is comparable to the discounted setting.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了联邦学习的通信效率，展示了在实际部署中的强可扩展性，解决了梯度数据压缩的关键挑战。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without exposing clients' private data, but its deployment is often constrained by the communication cost of transmitting gradients between clients and the central server, especially under system heterogeneity where low-bandwidth clients bottleneck overall performance. Lossy compression of gradient data can mitigate this overhead, and error-bounded lossy compression (EBLC) is particularly appealing for its fine-grained utility-compression tradeoff. However, existing EBLC methods (e.g., SZ), originally designed for smooth scientific data with strong spatial locality, rely on generic predictors such as Lorenzo and interpolation for entropy reduction to improve compression ratio. Gradient tensors, in contrast, exhibit low smoothness and weak spatial correlation, rendering these predictors ineffective and leading to poor compression ratios. To address this limitation, we propose an EBLC framework tailored for FL gradient data to achieve high compression ratios while preserving model accuracy. The core of it is an innovative prediction mechanism that exploits temporal correlations across FL training rounds and structural regularities within convolutional kernels to reduce residual entropy. The predictor is compatible with standard quantizers and entropy coders and comprises (1) a cross-round magnitude predictor based on a normalized exponential moving average, and (2) a sign predictor that leverages gradient oscillation and kernel-level sign consistency. Experiments show that this new EBLC yields up to 1.53x higher compression ratios than SZ3 with lower accuracy loss. Integrated into a real-world FL framework, APPFL, it reduces end-to-end communication time by 76.1%-96.2% under various constrained-bandwidth scenarios, demonstrating strong scalability for real-world FL deployments.

Abstract: Ambient sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) in smart homes remains challenging due to the need for real-time inference, spatially grounded reasoning, and context-aware temporal modeling. Existing approaches often rely on pre-segmented, within-activity data and overlook the physical layout of the environment, limiting their robustness in continuous, real-world deployments. In this paper, we propose MARAuder's Map, a novel framework for real-time activity recognition from raw, unsegmented sensor streams. Our method projects sensor activations onto the physical floorplan to generate trajectory-aware, image-like sequences that capture the spatial flow of human movement. These representations are processed by a hybrid deep learning model that jointly captures spatial structure and temporal dependencies. To enhance temporal awareness, we introduce a learnable time embedding module that encodes contextual cues such as hour-of-day and day-of-week. Additionally, an attention-based encoder selectively focuses on informative segments within each observation window, enabling accurate recognition even under cross-activity transitions and temporal ambiguity. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world smart home datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms strong baselines, offering a practical solution for real-time HAR in ambient sensor environments.

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning have achieved significant success in automatically devising effective traffic signal control (TSC) policies. Neural policies, however, tend to be over-parameterized and non-transparent, hindering their interpretability and deployability on resource-limited edge devices. This work presents SymLight, a priority function search framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for discovering inherently interpretable and deployable symbolic priority functions to serve as the TSC policies. The priority function, in particular, accepts traffic features as input and then outputs a priority for each traffic signal phase, which subsequently directs the phase transition. For effective search, we propose a concise yet expressive priority function representation. This helps mitigate the combinatorial explosion of the action space in MCTS. Additionally, a probabilistic structural rollout strategy is introduced to leverage structural patterns from previously discovered high-quality priority functions, guiding the rollout process. Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate SymLight's superior performance across a range of baselines. A key advantage is SymLight's ability to produce interpretable and deployable TSC policies while maintaining excellent performance.

Abstract: In multi-objective decision-making with hierarchical preferences, lexicographic bandits provide a natural framework for optimizing multiple objectives in a prioritized order. In this setting, a learner repeatedly selects arms and observes reward vectors, aiming to maximize the reward for the highest-priority objective, then the next, and so on. While previous studies have primarily focused on regret minimization, this work bridges the gap between \textit{regret minimization} and \textit{best arm identification} under lexicographic preferences. We propose two elimination-based algorithms to address this joint objective. The first algorithm eliminates suboptimal arms sequentially, layer by layer, in accordance with the objective priorities, and achieves sample complexity and regret bounds comparable to those of the best single-objective algorithms. The second algorithm simultaneously leverages reward information from all objectives in each round, effectively exploiting cross-objective dependencies. Remarkably, it outperforms the known lower bound for the single-objective bandit problem, highlighting the benefit of cross-objective information sharing in the multi-objective setting. Empirical results further validate their superior performance over baselines.

Abstract: Agentic language models compose multi step reasoning chains, yet intermediate steps can be corrupted by inconsistent context, retrieval errors, or adversarial inputs, which makes post hoc evaluation too late because errors propagate before detection. We introduce a diagnostic that requires no additional training and uses only the forward pass to emit a binary accept or reject signal during agent execution. The method analyzes token graphs induced by attention and computes two spectral statistics in early layers, namely the high frequency energy ratio and spectral entropy. We formalize these signals, establish invariances, and provide finite sample estimators with uncertainty quantification. Under a two regime mixture assumption with a monotone likelihood ratio property, we show that a single threshold on the high frequency energy ratio is optimal in the Bayes sense for detecting context inconsistency. Empirically, the high frequency energy ratio exhibits robust bimodality during context verification across multiple model families, which enables gating decisions with overhead below one millisecond on our hardware and configurations. We demonstrate integration into retrieval augmented agent pipelines and discuss deployment as an inline safety monitor. The approach detects contamination while the model is still processing the text, before errors commit to the reasoning chain.

Conclusion: 该方法为实现现实环境中更高效的模型评估迈出了重要一步，能够充分利用昂贵的RCT数据

Abstract: AI models are often evaluated based on their ability to predict the outcome of interest. However, in many AI for social impact applications, the presence of an intervention that affects the outcome can bias the evaluation. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) randomly assign interventions, allowing data from the control group to be used for unbiased model evaluation. However, this approach is inefficient because it ignores data from the treatment group. Given the complexity and cost often associated with RCTs, making the most use of the data is essential. Thus, we investigate model evaluation strategies that leverage all data from an RCT. First, we theoretically quantify the estimation bias that arises from naïvely aggregating performance estimates from treatment and control groups, and derive the condition under which this bias leads to incorrect model selection. Leveraging these theoretical insights, we propose nuisance parameter weighting (NPW), an unbiased model evaluation approach that reweights data from the treatment group to mimic the distributions of samples that would or would not experience the outcome under no intervention. Using synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed evaluation approach consistently yields better model selection than the standard approach, which ignores data from the treatment group, across various intervention effect and sample size settings. Our contribution represents a meaningful step towards more efficient model evaluation in real-world contexts.

Conclusion: MOSS框架成功解决了FP8训练中的效率和数值稳定性问题，为大模型高效训练提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Training large language models with FP8 formats offers significant efficiency gains. However, the reduced numerical precision of FP8 poses challenges for stable and accurate training. Current frameworks preserve training performance using mixed-granularity quantization, i.e., applying per-group quantization for activations and per-tensor/block quantization for weights. While effective, per-group quantization requires scaling along the inner dimension of matrix multiplication, introducing additional dequantization overhead. Moreover, these frameworks often rely on just-in-time scaling to dynamically adjust scaling factors based on the current data distribution. However, this online quantization is inefficient for FP8 training, as it involves multiple memory reads and writes that negate the performance benefits of FP8. To overcome these limitations, we propose MOSS, a novel FP8 training framework that ensures both efficiency and numerical stability. MOSS introduces two key innovations: (1) a two-level microscaling strategy for quantizing sensitive activations, which balances precision and dequantization cost by combining a high-precision global scale with compact, power-of-two local scales; and (2) automatic scaling for weights in linear layers, which eliminates the need for costly max-reduction operations by predicting and adjusting scaling factors during training. Leveraging these techniques, MOSS enables efficient FP8 training of a 7B parameter model, achieving performance comparable to the BF16 baseline while achieving up to 34% higher training throughput.

Abstract: In today's landscape, Mixture of Experts (MoE) is a crucial architecture that has been used by many of the most advanced models. One of the major challenges of MoE models is that they usually require much more memory than their dense counterparts due to their unique architecture, and hence are harder to deploy in environments with limited GPU memory, such as edge devices. MoE offloading is a promising technique proposed to overcome this challenge, especially if it is enhanced with caching and pre-fetching, but prior work stopped at suboptimal caching algorithm and offered limited insights. In this work, we study MoE offloading in depth and make the following contributions: 1. We analyze the expert activation and LRU caching behavior in detail and provide traces. 2. We propose LFU caching optimization based on our analysis and obtain strong improvements from LRU. 3. We implement and experiment speculative expert pre-fetching, providing detailed trace showing its huge potential . 4. In addition, our study extensively covers the behavior of the MoE architecture itself, offering information on the characteristic of the gating network and experts. This can inspire future work on the interpretation of MoE models and the development of pruning techniques for MoE architecture with minimal performance loss.

Abstract: Recent research has demonstrated that artificial intelligence (AI) can assist electronic design automation (EDA) in improving both the quality and efficiency of chip design. But current AI for EDA (AI-EDA) infrastructures remain fragmented, lacking comprehensive solutions for the entire data pipeline from design execution to AI integration. Key challenges include fragmented flow engines that generate raw data, heterogeneous file formats for data exchange, non-standardized data extraction methods, and poorly organized data storage. This work introduces a unified open-source library for EDA (AiEDA) that addresses these issues. AiEDA integrates multiple design-to-vector data representation techniques that transform diverse chip design data into universal multi-level vector representations, establishing an AI-aided design (AAD) paradigm optimized for AI-EDA workflows. AiEDA provides complete physical design flows with programmatic data extraction and standardized Python interfaces bridging EDA datasets and AI frameworks. Leveraging the AiEDA library, we generate iDATA, a 600GB dataset of structured data derived from 50 real chip designs (28nm), and validate its effectiveness through seven representative AAD tasks spanning prediction, generation, optimization and analysis. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/OSCC-Project/AiEDA, while the full iDATA dataset is being prepared for public release, providing a foundation for future AI-EDA research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分类数据聚类中距离度量至关重要，但由于分类数据无法直接计算距离，且不同簇中属性值的分布差异会影响距离测量，现有方法未充分考虑这一点，导致距离测量不合理。

Method: 提出集群定制化距离度量方法，根据每个簇中属性的不同分布竞争性地更新距离，并将该方法扩展到包含数值和分类属性的混合数据。

Result: 在14个数据集上的实验表明，该方法平均排名约为第一，证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: 所提出的集群定制化距离度量方法能够有效解决分类数据聚类中的距离测量问题，在多个数据集上表现优异。

Abstract: An appropriate distance metric is crucial for categorical data clustering, as the distance between categorical data cannot be directly calculated. However, the distances between attribute values usually vary in different clusters induced by their different distributions, which has not been taken into account, thus leading to unreasonable distance measurement. Therefore, we propose a cluster-customized distance metric for categorical data clustering, which can competitively update distances based on different distributions of attributes in each cluster. In addition, we extend the proposed distance metric to the mixed data that contains both numerical and categorical attributes. Experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method, i.e., achieving an average ranking of around first in fourteen datasets.

TL;DR: 提出PFRP方法，通过检索全局历史数据来增强时间序列预测精度，将全局预测与局部模型输出自适应结合，在7个真实数据集上平均提升8.4%性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型在推理时只能访问滑动窗口内的局部上下文，无法显式利用全局历史数据中的丰富模式，导致历史信息利用不足。

Method: 构建全局记忆库(GMB)存储历史模式，使用检索机制提取相似模式生成全局预测，然后与任何局部预测模型输出自适应结合。

Result: 在7个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，PFRP显著提升了先进单变量预测模型的平均性能8.4%。

Conclusion: PFRP通过显式整合全局历史数据，有效提升了时间序列预测的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Deep learning models such as MLP, Transformer, and TCN have achieved remarkable success in univariate time series forecasting, typically relying on sliding window samples from historical data for training. However, while these models implicitly compress historical information into their parameters during training, they are unable to explicitly and dynamically access this global knowledge during inference, relying only on the local context within the lookback window. This results in an underutilization of rich patterns from the global history. To bridge this gap, we propose Predicting the Future by Retrieving the Past (PFRP), a novel approach that explicitly integrates global historical data to enhance forecasting accuracy. Specifically, we construct a Global Memory Bank (GMB) to effectively store and manage global historical patterns. A retrieval mechanism is then employed to extract similar patterns from the GMB, enabling the generation of global predictions. By adaptively combining these global predictions with the outputs of any local prediction model, PFRP produces more accurate and interpretable forecasts. Extensive experiments conducted on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that PFRP significantly enhances the average performance of advanced univariate forecasting models by 8.4\%.

TL;DR: EMOD是一个统一的EEG情感表示框架，利用效价-唤醒度引导的对比学习来解决跨数据集情感识别的泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习模型在单一EEG情感数据集上表现良好，但由于标注方案和数据格式的异质性，跨数据集的泛化能力有限。现有模型通常需要针对特定数据集的架构，缺乏跨不同情感标签的语义对齐。

Method: EMOD通过将离散和连续情感标签投影到统一的效价-唤醒度空间，并制定软加权监督对比损失来学习可转移的情感感知表示。采用包含三重域编码器和时空变换器的灵活骨干网络，适应不同的EEG格式。

Result: 在8个公共EEG数据集上预训练并在3个基准数据集上评估，EMOD实现了最先进的性能，展示了跨不同EEG情感识别场景的强大适应性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: EMOD通过统一的V-A空间表示和对比学习，成功解决了EEG情感识别中的跨数据集泛化问题，为情感计算提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Emotion recognition from EEG signals is essential for affective computing and has been widely explored using deep learning. While recent deep learning approaches have achieved strong performance on single EEG emotion datasets, their generalization across datasets remains limited due to the heterogeneity in annotation schemes and data formats. Existing models typically require dataset-specific architectures tailored to input structure and lack semantic alignment across diverse emotion labels. To address these challenges, we propose EMOD: A Unified EEG Emotion Representation Framework Leveraging Valence-Arousal (V-A) Guided Contrastive Learning. EMOD learns transferable and emotion-aware representations from heterogeneous datasets by bridging both semantic and structural gaps. Specifically, we project discrete and continuous emotion labels into a unified V-A space and formulate a soft-weighted supervised contrastive loss that encourages emotionally similar samples to cluster in the latent space. To accommodate variable EEG formats, EMOD employs a flexible backbone comprising a Triple-Domain Encoder followed by a Spatial-Temporal Transformer, enabling robust extraction and integration of temporal, spectral, and spatial features. We pretrain EMOD on eight public EEG datasets and evaluate its performance on three benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that EMOD achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating strong adaptability and generalization across diverse EEG-based emotion recognition scenarios.

Method: 采用节点基础方法和节点预测适应策略来构建TSP路径，对TabPFN模型进行适应和微调，使用单一样本进行训练。

Conclusion: TabPFN模型是在训练资源约束和快速部署需求下解决结构化和组合优化问题的有前景方法。

Abstract: Tabular Prior-Data Fitted Network (TabPFN) is a foundation model designed for small to medium-sized tabular data, which has attracted much attention recently. This paper investigates the application of TabPFN in Combinatorial Optimization (CO) problems. The aim is to lessen challenges in time and data-intensive training requirements often observed in using traditional methods including exact and heuristic algorithms, Machine Learning (ML)-based models, to solve CO problems. Proposing possibly the first ever application of TabPFN for such a purpose, we adapt and fine-tune the TabPFN model to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), one of the most well-known CO problems. Specifically, we adopt the node-based approach and the node-predicting adaptation strategy to construct the entire TSP route. Our evaluation with varying instance sizes confirms that TabPFN requires minimal training, adapts to TSP using a single sample, performs better generalization across varying TSP instance sizes, and reduces performance degradation. Furthermore, the training process with adaptation and fine-tuning is completed within minutes. The methodology leads to strong solution quality even without post-processing and achieves performance comparable to other models with post-processing refinement. Our findings suggest that the TabPFN model is a promising approach to solve structured and CO problems efficiently under training resource constraints and rapid deployment requirements.

Conclusion: FusionLog通过有效融合通用和专有知识，在无需目标系统标注数据的情况下实现了优异的跨系统日志异常检测性能。

Abstract: Log-based anomaly detection is critical for ensuring the stability and reliability of web systems. One of the key problems in this task is the lack of sufficient labeled logs, which limits the rapid deployment in new systems. Existing works usually leverage large-scale labeled logs from a mature web system and a small amount of labeled logs from a new system, using transfer learning to extract and generalize general knowledge across both domains. However, these methods focus solely on the transfer of general knowledge and neglect the disparity and potential mismatch between such knowledge and the proprietary knowledge of target system, thus constraining performance. To address this limitation, we propose FusionLog, a novel zero-label cross-system log-based anomaly detection method that effectively achieves the fusion of general and proprietary knowledge, enabling cross-system generalization without any labeled target logs. Specifically, we first design a training-free router based on semantic similarity that dynamically partitions unlabeled target logs into 'general logs' and 'proprietary logs.' For general logs, FusionLog employs a small model based on system-agnostic representation meta-learning for direct training and inference, inheriting the general anomaly patterns shared between the source and target systems. For proprietary logs, we iteratively generate pseudo-labels and fine-tune the small model using multi-round collaborative knowledge distillation and fusion based on large language model (LLM) and small model (SM) to enhance its capability to recognize anomaly patterns specific to the target system. Experimental results on three public log datasets from different systems show that FusionLog achieves over 90% F1-score under a fully zero-label setting, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art cross-system log-based anomaly detection methods.

Motivation: PEM水电解制绿氢对能源转型至关重要，但氢通过膜的交叉现象威胁安全性和经济性，现有物理模型需要大量校准和计算资源，而纯数据驱动方法无法在训练条件外有效预测。

Conclusion: 该工作建立了实时电解槽监测新范式，通过结合物理严谨性和计算效率，加速安全高效绿氢基础设施部署，对实现净零排放目标至关重要。

Abstract: Green hydrogen production via polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) water electrolysis is pivotal for energy transition, yet hydrogen crossover through membranes threatens safety and economic viability-approaching explosive limits (4 mol% H$_2$ in O$_2$) while reducing Faradaic efficiency by 2.5%. Current physics-based models require extensive calibration and computational resources that preclude real-time implementation, while purely data-driven approaches fail to extrapolate beyond training conditions-critical for dynamic electrolyzer operation. Here we present the first application of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for hydrogen crossover prediction, integrating mass conservation, Fick's diffusion law, and Henry's solubility law within a compact architecture (17,793 parameters). Validated across six membranes under industrially relevant conditions (0.05-5.0 A/cm$^2$, 1-200 bar, 25-85°C), our PINN achieves exceptional accuracy (R$^2$ = 99.84%, RMSE = 0.0348%) with sub-millisecond inference times suitable for real-time control. Remarkably, the model maintains R$^2$ > 86% when predicting crossover at pressures 2.5x beyond training range-substantially outperforming pure neural networks (R$^2$ = 43.4%). The hardware-agnostic deployment, from desktop CPUs to edge devices (Raspberry Pi 4), enables distributed safety monitoring essential for gigawatt-scale installations. By bridging physical rigor and computational efficiency, this work establishes a new paradigm for real-time electrolyzer monitoring, accelerating deployment of safe, efficient green hydrogen infrastructure crucial for net-zero emissions targets.

Motivation: 传统分数匹配方法需要为每个分布训练单独模型，缺乏泛化能力。希望开发一个分布无关的算子，能够统一处理不同密度函数和样本规模。

Method: 将问题构建为序列到序列任务，使用交叉注意力连接观测样本和查询点，通过内置对称约束确保置换和仿射等变性，建立与经典核密度估计的理论联系。

Conclusion: transformer可作为非参数密度和分数估计的通用数据自适应算子，建立了经典KDE与transformer架构之间的理论联系。

Abstract: We introduce a unified attention-based framework for joint score and density estimation. Framing the problem as a sequence-to-sequence task, we develop a permutation- and affine-equivariant transformer that estimates both the probability density $f(x)$ and its score $\nabla_x \log f(x)$ directly from i.i.d. samples. Unlike traditional score-matching methods that require training a separate model for each distribution, our approach learns a single distribution-agnostic operator that generalizes across densities and sample sizes. The architecture employs cross-attention to connect observed samples with arbitrary query points, enabling generalization beyond the training data, while built-in symmetry constraints ensure equivariance to permutation and affine transformations. Analytically, we show that the attention weights can recover classical kernel density estimation (KDE), and verify it empirically, establishing a principled link between classical KDE and the transformer architecture. Empirically, the model achieves substantially lower error and better scaling than KDE and score-debiased KDE (SD-KDE), while exhibiting better runtime scaling. Together, these results establish transformers as general-purpose, data-adaptive operators for nonparametric density and score estimation.

Motivation: COPD患者住院风险高且与生存率下降密切相关，但预测这些事件的时间仍具挑战性，文献中对此关注有限。

Method: 使用西班牙加泰罗尼亚SIDIAP数据库中超过15万患者的数据（2013-2017年），将住院建模为首发事件，死亡作为半竞争性终点事件，比较了Cox比例风险、SurvivalBoost、DeepPseudo、SurvTRACE、Dynamic Deep-Hit和Deep Recurrent Survival Machine等多种模型。

Result: 深度学习模型，特别是基于循环架构的模型，在一致性和时间依赖性AUC方面优于机器学习和线性方法，尤其是在预测较难的住院事件方面表现更佳。

Conclusion: 这是首次在纵向EHR数据上应用深度生存分析来联合预测COPD患者的多个时间到事件结果，突显了深度学习方法捕捉时间模式和改进风险分层的潜力。

Abstract: Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have an increased risk of hospitalizations, strongly associated with decreased survival, yet predicting the timing of these events remains challenging and has received limited attention in the literature. In this study, we performed survival analysis to predict hospitalization and death in COPD patients using longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs), comparing statistical models, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) approaches. We analyzed data from more than 150k patients from the SIDIAP database in Catalonia, Spain, from 2013 to 2017, modeling hospitalization as a first event and death as a semi-competing terminal event. Multiple models were evaluated, including Cox proportional hazards, SurvivalBoost, DeepPseudo, SurvTRACE, Dynamic Deep-Hit, and Deep Recurrent Survival Machine. Results showed that DL models utilizing recurrent architectures outperformed both ML and linear approaches in concordance and time-dependent AUC, especially for hospitalization, which proved to be the harder event to predict. This study is, to our knowledge, the first to apply deep survival analysis on longitudinal EHR data to jointly predict multiple time-to-event outcomes in COPD patients, highlighting the potential of DL approaches to capture temporal patterns and improve risk stratification.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Transformer缺乏将历史压缩为紧凑潜在状态的固有动机，导致学习解决方案泛化能力差。需要一种方法来鼓励Transformer形成具有自身信念状态和转换动态的紧凑内部世界模型。

Method: Next-Latent Prediction (NextLat)在标准下一个token训练基础上，增加了潜在空间的自监督预测，训练Transformer学习能够预测其下一个潜在状态的潜在表示。

Result: 在针对核心序列建模能力的基准测试中，NextLat在下游准确性、表示压缩和前向规划方面相比标准下一个token训练显示出显著提升。

Conclusion: NextLat是一个简单高效的范式，能够将Transformer表示塑造成具有更强泛化能力的信念状态，同时保持其架构、并行训练和推理不变。

Abstract: Transformers replace recurrence with a memory that grows with sequence length and self-attention that enables ad-hoc look ups over past tokens. Consequently, they lack an inherent incentive to compress history into compact latent states with consistent transition rules. This often leads to learning solutions that generalize poorly. We introduce Next-Latent Prediction (NextLat), which extends standard next-token training with self-supervised predictions in the latent space. Specifically, NextLat trains a transformer to learn latent representations that are predictive of its next latent state given the next output token. Theoretically, we show that these latents provably converge to belief states, compressed information of the history necessary to predict the future. This simple auxiliary objective also injects a recurrent inductive bias into transformers, while leaving their architecture, parallel training, and inference unchanged. NextLat effectively encourages the transformer to form compact internal world models with its own belief states and transition dynamics -- a crucial property absent in standard next-token prediction transformers. Empirically, across benchmarks targeting core sequence modeling competencies -- world modeling, reasoning, planning, and language modeling -- NextLat demonstrates significant gains over standard next-token training in downstream accuracy, representation compression, and lookahead planning. NextLat stands as a simple and efficient paradigm for shaping transformer representations toward stronger generalization.

Abstract: Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is a cardiac electrophysiology (EP) disorder caused by the presence of an accessory pathway (AP) that bypasses the atrioventricular node, faster ventricular activation rate, and provides a substrate for atrio-ventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT). Accurate localization of the AP is critical for planning and guiding catheter ablation procedures. While traditional diagnostic tree (DT) methods and more recent machine learning (ML) approaches have been proposed to predict AP location from surface electrocardiogram (ECG), they are often constrained by limited anatomical localization resolution, poor interpretability, and the use of small clinical datasets. In this study, we present a Deep Learning (DL) model for the localization of single manifest APs across 24 cardiac regions, trained on a large, physiologically realistic database of synthetic ECGs generated using a personalized virtual heart model. We also integrate eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, Guided Backpropagation, Grad-CAM, and Guided Grad-CAM, into the pipeline. This enables interpretation of DL decision-making and addresses one of the main barriers to clinical adoption: lack of transparency in ML predictions. Our model achieves localization accuracy above 95%, with a sensitivity of 94.32% and specificity of 99.78%. XAI outputs are physiologically validated against known depolarization patterns, and a novel index is introduced to identify the most informative ECG leads for AP localization. Results highlight lead V2 as the most critical, followed by aVF, V1, and aVL. This work demonstrates the potential of combining cardiac digital twins with explainable DL to enable accurate, transparent, and non-invasive AP localization.

Abstract: Anomaly troubleshooting for large model distributed inference (LMDI) remains a critical challenge. Resolving anomalies such as inference performance degradation or latency jitter in distributed system demands significant manual efforts from domain experts, resulting in extremely time-consuming diagnosis processes with relatively low accuracy. In this paper, we introduce Kunlun Anomaly Troubleshooter (KAT), the first anomaly troubleshooting framework tailored for LMDI. KAT addresses this problem through two core innovations. First, KAT exploits the synchronicity and consistency of GPU workers, innovatively leverages function trace data to precisely detect kernel-level anomalies and associated hardware components at nanosecond resolution. Second, KAT integrates these detection results into a domain-adapted LLM, delivering systematic causal reasoning and natural language interpretation of complex anomaly symptoms.

Abstract: Foundation models for time series imputation remain largely unexplored. Recently, two such models, TabPFN-TS and MoTM, have emerged. These models share a common philosophy that places them within the family of time-indexed foundation models. This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study of these models for zero-shot imputation, which enables missing value recovery without retraining across a wide range of scenarios. We conduct extensive univariate experiments across 33 out-of-domain datasets (approximately 1.3M imputation windows) and evaluate their ability to integrate covariates at inference time to improve accuracy without fine-tuning. Our results demonstrate that time-indexed foundation models are a powerful and practical step toward achieving general-purpose, zero-shot imputation for real-world time series.

Motivation: 柔性电子在医疗可穿戴设备中具有独特优势，但现有系统存在门数有限、特征尺寸大、静态功耗高等问题，难以实现高效的机载机器学习分类。

Method: 设计机械柔性RISC-V系统，集成定制乘累加协处理器，采用固定系数最大化能效；通过约束编程问题联合确定协处理器常数和优化MLP推理操作映射。

Conclusion: 该技术为可访问、可持续和贴合式医疗可穿戴设备提供了有前景的发展路径。

Abstract: Flexible electronics offer unique advantages for conformable, lightweight, and disposable healthcare wearables. However, their limited gate count, large feature sizes, and high static power consumption make on-body machine learning classification highly challenging. While existing bendable RISC-V systems provide compact solutions, they lack the energy efficiency required. We present a mechanically flexible RISC-V that integrates a bespoke multiply-accumulate co-processor with fixed coefficients to maximize energy efficiency and minimize latency. Our approach formulates a constrained programming problem to jointly determine co-processor constants and optimally map Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) inference operations, enabling compact, model-specific hardware by leveraging the low fabrication and non-recurring engineering costs of flexible technologies. Post-layout results demonstrate near-real-time performance across several healthcare datasets, with our circuits operating within the power budget of existing flexible batteries and occupying only 2.42 mm^2, offering a promising path toward accessible, sustainable, and conformable healthcare wearables. Our microprocessors achieve an average 2.35x speedup and 2.15x lower energy consumption compared to the state of the art.

TL;DR: MoSKA通过区分请求特有序列和共享序列，将共享数据的注意力计算从内存受限的GEMV操作转换为计算受限的GEMM操作，显著提升LLM推理吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM中不断增长的上下文长度导致的KV缓存性能瓶颈问题，该瓶颈由于内存受限特性导致GPU利用率低下。

Method: 提出混合共享KV注意力架构，包含：1) 共享KV注意力机制，将共享数据注意力计算批处理为GEMM操作；2) MoE启发的稀疏注意力策略；3) 专用分离基础设施。

Result: 在高上下文共享工作负载中，相比基线实现了高达538.7倍的吞吐量提升。

Conclusion: MoSKA为可扩展的LLM推理提供了一条清晰的架构路径。

Abstract: The escalating context length in Large Language Models (LLMs) creates a severe performance bottleneck around the Key-Value (KV) cache, whose memory-bound nature leads to significant GPU under-utilization. This paper introduces Mixture of Shared KV Attention (MoSKA), an architecture that addresses this challenge by exploiting the heterogeneity of context data. It differentiates between per-request unique and massively reused shared sequences. The core of MoSKA is a novel Shared KV Attention mechanism that transforms the attention on shared data from a series of memory-bound GEMV operations into a single, compute-bound GEMM by batching concurrent requests. This is supported by an MoE-inspired sparse attention strategy that prunes the search space and a tailored Disaggregated Infrastructure that specializes hardware for unique and shared data. This comprehensive approach demonstrates a throughput increase of up to 538.7x over baselines in workloads with high context sharing, offering a clear architectural path toward scalable LLM inference.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Lethe是一个动态KV缓存管理框架，通过空间维度的层级稀疏感知分配和时间维度的多轮token剪枝，有效减少生成式推理中的内存和延迟开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在生成式推理中会产生长解码序列，导致KV缓存积累造成显著的内存和延迟开销。现有KV压缩方法主要关注减少长输入序列的预填充内存，但无法有效处理长文本生成的动态和层级敏感特性。

Method: Lethe框架在空间维度进行层级稀疏感知分配，基于注意力冗余估计为每个transformer层分配token剪枝预算；在时间维度通过基于最近性感知选择性保留(RASR)机制进行多轮token剪枝，结合传统最近性启发式和从演化注意力模式中得出的token相关性。

Result: 实验结果表明，Lethe在不同模型和任务上实现了效率与生成质量的良好平衡，吞吐量最高提升2.56倍。

Conclusion: Lethe通过动态KV缓存管理有效解决了长文本生成中的内存和延迟问题，为生成式推理任务提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Generative reasoning with large language models (LLMs) often involves long decoding sequences, leading to substantial memory and latency overheads from accumulating key-value (KV) caches. While existing KV compression methods primarily focus on reducing prefill memory from long input sequences, they fall short in addressing the dynamic and layer-sensitive nature of long-form generation, which is central to reasoning tasks. We propose Lethe, a dynamic KV cache management framework that introduces adaptivity along both the spatial and temporal dimensions of decoding. Along the spatial dimension, Lethe performs layerwise sparsity-aware allocation, assigning token pruning budgets to each transformer layer based on estimated attention redundancy. Along the temporal dimension, Lethe conducts multi-round token pruning during generation, driven by a Recency-Aware Selective Retention} (RASR) mechanism. RASR extends traditional recency-based heuristics by also considering token relevance derived from evolving attention patterns, enabling informed decisions about which tokens to retain or evict. Empirical results demonstrate that Lethe achieves a favorable balance between efficiency and generation quality across diverse models and tasks, increases throughput by up to 2.56x.

TL;DR: ITPP是一种新颖的通道独立架构，用于标记时间点过程建模，通过解耦事件类型信息并使用ODE骨干网络，显著提升了预测准确性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MTPP模型使用通道混合策略，将不同类型事件信息编码到单一固定大小的潜在表示中，这种纠缠会模糊类型特定的动态，导致性能下降和过拟合风险增加。

Method: 采用编码器-解码器框架和ODE骨干网络，核心是类型感知的反转自注意力机制，显式建模异构事件类型间的通道间相关性。

Result: 在多个真实世界和合成数据集上的综合实验表明，ITPP在预测准确性和泛化能力方面始终优于最先进的MTPP模型。

Conclusion: ITPP架构通过通道独立设计有效提升了MTPP建模的效果和鲁棒性，同时减少了过拟合。

Abstract: Marked Temporal Point Processes (MTPPs) provide a principled framework for modeling asynchronous event sequences by conditioning on the history of past events. However, most existing MTPP models rely on channel-mixing strategies that encode information from different event types into a single, fixed-size latent representation. This entanglement can obscure type-specific dynamics, leading to performance degradation and increased risk of overfitting. In this work, we introduce ITPP, a novel channel-independent architecture for MTPP modeling that decouples event type information using an encoder-decoder framework with an ODE-based backbone. Central to ITPP is a type-aware inverted self-attention mechanism, designed to explicitly model inter-channel correlations among heterogeneous event types. This architecture enhances effectiveness and robustness while reducing overfitting. Comprehensive experiments on multiple real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that ITPP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MTPP models in both predictive accuracy and generalization.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient global ocean state estimation remains a grand challenge for Earth system science, hindered by the dual bottlenecks of computational scalability and degraded data fidelity in traditional data assimilation (DA) and deep learning (DL) approaches. Here we present an AI-driven Data Assimilation Framework for Ocean (ADAF-Ocean) that directly assimilates multi-source and multi-scale observations, ranging from sparse in-situ measurements to 4 km satellite swaths, without any interpolation or data thinning. Inspired by Neural Processes, ADAF-Ocean learns a continuous mapping from heterogeneous inputs to ocean states, preserving native data fidelity. Through AI-driven super-resolution, it reconstructs 0.25$^\circ$ mesoscale dynamics from coarse 1$^\circ$ fields, which ensures both efficiency and scalability, with just 3.7\% more parameters than the 1$^\circ$ configuration. When coupled with a DL forecasting system, ADAF-Ocean extends global forecast skill by up to 20 days compared to baselines without assimilation. This framework establishes a computationally viable and scientifically rigorous pathway toward real-time, high-resolution Earth system monitoring.

Abstract: We propose a consistency model based on the optimal-transport flow. A physics-informed design of partially input-convex neural networks (PICNN) plays a central role in constructing the flow field that emulates the displacement interpolation. During the training stage, we couple the Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) residual in the OT formulation with the original flow matching loss function. Our approach avoids inner optimization subproblems that are present in previous one-step OFM approaches. During the prediction stage, our approach supports both one-step (Brenier-map) and multi-step ODE sampling from the same learned potential, leveraging the straightness of the OT flow. We validate scalability and performance on standard OT benchmarks.

Result: 在大规模图数据上的实验证明了RBA的优势，能够改进现有模型并替换其注意力机制。

Conclusion: RBA不仅提供了一种高效的注意力机制，还为注意力机制的理论分析提供了新工具。

Abstract: Attention mechanism is a significant part of Transformer models. It helps extract features from embedded vectors by adding global information and its expressivity has been proved to be powerful. Nevertheless, the quadratic complexity restricts its practicability. Although several researches have provided attention mechanism in sparse form, they are lack of theoretical analysis about the expressivity of their mechanism while reducing complexity. In this paper, we put forward Random Batch Attention (RBA), a linear self-attention mechanism, which has theoretical support of the ability to maintain its expressivity. Random Batch Attention has several significant strengths as follows: (1) Random Batch Attention has linear time complexity. Other than this, it can be implemented in parallel on a new dimension, which contributes to much memory saving. (2) Random Batch Attention mechanism can improve most of the existing models by replacing their attention mechanisms, even many previously improved attention mechanisms. (3) Random Batch Attention mechanism has theoretical explanation in convergence, as it comes from Random Batch Methods on computation mathematics. Experiments on large graphs have proved advantages mentioned above. Also, the theoretical modeling of self-attention mechanism is a new tool for future research on attention-mechanism analysis.

Motivation: 大多数后门攻击研究集中在图像等同质数据上，而表格数据由于同时包含数值和分类特征，攻击更具挑战性。

Method: 将分类值转换为浮点数表示，保持足够信息以维持干净模型精度，创建适用于所有特征（包括分类特征）的基于梯度的通用扰动。

Result: 在5个数据集和4个流行模型上评估，在白盒和黑盒设置（包括Vertex AI等实际应用）中攻击成功率高达100%，超越了Tabdoor等先前工作，并能逃避最先进的防御机制检测。

Conclusion: 该方法揭示了表格数据的严重安全漏洞，成功绕过了Spectral Signatures、Neural Cleanse、Beatrix、Fine-Pruning等防御机制和流行的异常检测机制。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks in machine learning have drawn significant attention for their potential to compromise models stealthily, yet most research has focused on homogeneous data such as images. In this work, we propose a novel backdoor attack on tabular data, which is particularly challenging due to the presence of both numerical and categorical features. Our key idea is a novel technique to convert categorical values into floating-point representations. This approach preserves enough information to maintain clean-model accuracy compared to traditional methods like one-hot or ordinal encoding. By doing this, we create a gradient-based universal perturbation that applies to all features, including categorical ones.
  We evaluate our method on five datasets and four popular models. Our results show up to a 100% attack success rate in both white-box and black-box settings (including real-world applications like Vertex AI), revealing a severe vulnerability for tabular data. Our method is shown to surpass the previous works like Tabdoor in terms of performance, while remaining stealthy against state-of-the-art defense mechanisms. We evaluate our attack against Spectral Signatures, Neural Cleanse, Beatrix, and Fine-Pruning, all of which fail to defend successfully against it. We also verify that our attack successfully bypasses popular outlier detection mechanisms.

Abstract: Short-video recommenders such as Douyin must exploit extremely long user histories without breaking latency or cost budgets. We present an end-to-end system that scales long-sequence modeling to 10k-length histories in production. First, we introduce Stacked Target-to-History Cross Attention (STCA), which replaces history self-attention with stacked cross-attention from the target to the history, reducing complexity from quadratic to linear in sequence length and enabling efficient end-to-end training. Second, we propose Request Level Batching (RLB), a user-centric batching scheme that aggregates multiple targets for the same user/request to share the user-side encoding, substantially lowering sequence-related storage, communication, and compute without changing the learning objective. Third, we design a length-extrapolative training strategy -- train on shorter windows, infer on much longer ones -- so the model generalizes to 10k histories without additional training cost. Across offline and online experiments, we observe predictable, monotonic gains as we scale history length and model capacity, mirroring the scaling law behavior observed in large language models. Deployed at full traffic on Douyin, our system delivers significant improvements on key engagement metrics while meeting production latency, demonstrating a practical path to scaling end-to-end long-sequence recommendation to the 10k regime.

Abstract: Reliability analysis of engineering systems under uncertainty poses significant computational challenges, particularly for problems involving high-dimensional stochastic inputs, nonlinear system responses, and multiphysics couplings. Traditional surrogate modeling approaches often incur high energy consumption, which severely limits their scalability and deployability in resource-constrained environments. We introduce NeuroPOL, \textit{the first neuroscience-inspired physics-informed operator learning framework} for reliability analysis. NeuroPOL incorporates Variable Spiking Neurons into a physics-informed operator architecture, replacing continuous activations with event-driven spiking dynamics. This innovation promotes sparse communication, significantly reduces computational load, and enables an energy-efficient surrogate model. The proposed framework lowers both computational and power demands, supporting real-time reliability assessment and deployment on edge devices and digital twins. By embedding governing physical laws into operator learning, NeuroPOL builds physics-consistent surrogates capable of accurate uncertainty propagation and efficient failure probability estimation, even for high-dimensional problems. We evaluate NeuroPOL on five canonical benchmarks, the Burgers equation, Nagumo equation, two-dimensional Poisson equation, two-dimensional Darcy equation, and incompressible Navier-Stokes equation with energy coupling. Results show that NeuroPOL achieves reliability measures comparable to standard physics-informed operators, while introducing significant communication sparsity, enabling scalable, distributed, and energy-efficient deployment.

Abstract: Web agents struggle to adapt to new websites due to the scarcity of environment specific tasks and demonstrations. Recent works have explored synthetic data generation to address this challenge, however, they suffer from data quality issues where synthesized tasks contain hallucinations that cannot be executed, and collected trajectories are noisy with redundant or misaligned actions. In this paper, we propose SynthAgent, a fully synthetic supervision framework that aims at improving synthetic data quality via dual refinement of both tasks and trajectories. Our approach begins by synthesizing diverse tasks through categorized exploration of web elements, ensuring efficient coverage of the target environment. During trajectory collection, we refine tasks when conflicts with actual observations are detected, mitigating hallucinations while maintaining task consistency. After collection, we conduct trajectory refinement with a global context to mitigate potential noise or misalignments. Finally, we fine-tune open-source web agents on the refined synthetic data to adapt them to the target environment. Experimental results demonstrate that SynthAgent outperforms existing synthetic data methods, validating the importance of high-quality synthetic supervision. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/aiming-lab/SynthAgent.

Abstract: We study the sequential decision-making problem for automated weaning of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices in cardiogenic shock patients. MCS devices are percutaneous micro-axial flow pumps that provide left ventricular unloading and forward blood flow, but current weaning strategies vary significantly across care teams and lack data-driven approaches. Offline reinforcement learning (RL) has proven to be successful in sequential decision-making tasks, but our setting presents challenges for training and evaluating traditional offline RL methods: prohibition of online patient interaction, highly uncertain circulatory dynamics due to concurrent treatments, and limited data availability. We developed an end-to-end machine learning framework with two key contributions (1) Clinically-aware OOD-regularized Model-based Policy Optimization (CORMPO), a density-regularized offline RL algorithm for out-of-distribution suppression that also incorporates clinically-informed reward shaping and (2) a Transformer-based probabilistic digital twin that models MCS circulatory dynamics for policy evaluation with rich physiological and clinical metrics. We prove that \textsf{CORMPO} achieves theoretical performance guarantees under mild assumptions. CORMPO attains a higher reward than the offline RL baselines by 28% and higher scores in clinical metrics by 82.6% on real and synthetic datasets.

Abstract: As learning models continue to grow in size, enabling on-device local training of these models has emerged as a critical challenge in federated learning. A popular solution is sub-model training, where the server only distributes randomly sampled sub-models to the edge clients, and clients only update these small models. However, those random sampling of sub-models may not give satisfying convergence performance. In this paper, observing the success of SGD with shuffling, we propose a distributed shuffled sub-model training, where the full model is partitioned into several sub-models in advance, and the server shuffles those sub-models, sends each of them to clients at each round, and by the end of local updating period, clients send back the updated sub-models, and server averages them. We establish the convergence rate of this algorithm. We also study the generalization of distributed sub-model training via stability analysis, and find that the sub-model training can improve the generalization via amplifying the stability of training process. The extensive experiments also validate our theoretical findings.

Abstract: With the increase of data in day-to-day life, businesses and different stakeholders need to analyze the data for better predictions. Traditionally, relational data has been a source of various insights, but with the increase in computational power and the need to understand deeper relationships between entities, the need to design new techniques has arisen. For this graph data analysis has become an extraordinary tool for understanding the data, which reveals more realistic and flexible modelling of complex relationships. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great promise in various applications, such as social network analysis, recommendation systems, drug discovery, and more. However, many adversarial attacks can happen over the data, whether during training (poisoning attack) or during testing (evasion attack), which can adversely manipulate the desired outcome from the GNN model. Therefore, it is crucial to make the GNNs robust to such attacks. The existing robustness methods are computationally demanding and perform poorly when the intensity of attack increases. This paper presents a computationally efficient framework, namely, pLAPGNN, based on weighted p-Laplacian for making GNNs robust. Empirical evaluation on real datasets establishes the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed method.

Abstract: A promising alternative to the computationally expensive Neural Architecture Search (NAS) involves the development of \textit{Zero Cost Proxies (ZCPs)}, which correlate well to trained performance, but can be computed through a single forward/backward pass on a randomly sampled batch of data. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of ZCPs for HAR on six benchmark datasets, and demonstrate that they discover network architectures that obtain within 5\% of performance attained by full scale training involving 1500 randomly sampled architectures.

Abstract: Transfer learning of tabular data is non-trivial due to heterogeneity in the feature space across disparate domains. The limited success of traditional deep learning in tabular knowledge transfer can be advanced by leveraging large language models (LLMs). However, the efficacy of LLMs often stagnates for mixed data types structured in tables due to the limitations of text prompts and in-context learning. We propose a lightweight transfer learning framework that fine-tunes an LLM using source tabular data and transplants the LLM's selective $key$ and $value$ projection weights into a gated feature tokenized transformer (gFTT) built for tabular data. The gFTT model with cross-domain attention is fine-tuned using target tabular data for transfer learning, eliminating the need for shared features, LLM prompt engineering, and large-scale pretrained models. Our experiments using ten pairs of source-target data sets and 12 baselines demonstrate the superiority of the proposed LLM-attention transplant for transfer learning (LATTLE) method over traditional ML models, state-of-the-art deep tabular architectures, and transfer learning models trained on thousands to billions of tabular samples. The proposed attention transfer demonstrates an effective solution to learning relationships between data tables using an LLM in a low-resource learning environment. The source code for the proposed method is publicly available.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning the topology of a directed Gaussian Graphical Model under the equal-variance assumption, where the graph has $n$ nodes and maximum in-degree $d$. Prior work has established that $O(d \log n)$ samples are sufficient for this task. However, an important factor that is often overlooked in these analyses is the dependence on the condition number of the covariance matrix of the model. Indeed, all algorithms from prior work require a number of samples that grows polynomially with this condition number. In many cases this is unsatisfactory, since the condition number could grow polynomially with $n$, rendering these prior approaches impractical in high-dimensional settings. In this work, we provide an algorithm that recovers the underlying graph and prove that the number of samples required is independent of the condition number. Furthermore, we establish lower bounds that nearly match the upper bound up to a $d$-factor, thus providing an almost tight characterization of the true sample complexity of the problem. Moreover, under a further assumption that all the variances of the variables are bounded, we design a polynomial-time algorithm that recovers the underlying graph, at the cost of an additional polynomial dependence of the sample complexity on $d$. We complement our theoretical findings with simulations on synthetic datasets that confirm our predictions.

Abstract: Federated learning on clients with noisy labels is a challenging problem, as such clients can infiltrate the global model, impacting the overall generalizability of the system. Existing methods proposed to handle noisy clients assume that a sufficient number of clients with clean labels are available, which can be leveraged to learn a robust global model while dampening the impact of noisy clients. This assumption fails when a high number of heterogeneous clients contain noisy labels, making the existing approaches ineffective. In such scenarios, it is important to locally regularize the clients before communication with the global model, to ensure the global model isn't corrupted by noisy clients. While pre-trained self-supervised models can be effective for local regularization, existing centralized approaches relying on pretrained initialization are impractical in a federated setting due to the potentially large size of these models, which increases communication costs. In that line, we propose a regularization objective for client models that decouples the pre-trained and classification models by enforcing similarity between close data points within the client. We leverage the representation space of a self-supervised pretrained model to evaluate the closeness among examples. This regularization, when applied with the standard objective function for the downstream task in standard noisy federated settings, significantly improves performance, outperforming existing state-of-the-art federated methods in multiple computer vision and medical image classification benchmarks. Unlike other techniques that rely on self-supervised pretrained initialization, our method does not require the pretrained model and classifier backbone to share the same architecture, making it architecture-agnostic.

Abstract: Supply chains are integral to global economic stability, yet disruptions can swiftly propagate through interconnected networks, resulting in substantial economic impacts. Accurate and timely inference of supply chain resilience the capability to maintain core functions during disruptions is crucial for proactive risk mitigation and robust network design. However, existing approaches lack effective mechanisms to infer supply chain resilience without explicit system dynamics and struggle to represent the higher-order, multi-entity dependencies inherent in supply chain networks. These limitations motivate the definition of a novel problem and the development of targeted modeling solutions. To address these challenges, we formalize a novel problem: Supply Chain Resilience Inference (SCRI), defined as predicting supply chain resilience using hypergraph topology and observed inventory trajectories without explicit dynamic equations. To solve this problem, we propose the Supply Chain Resilience Inference Hypergraph Network (SC-RIHN), a novel hypergraph-based model leveraging set-based encoding and hypergraph message passing to capture multi-party firm-product interactions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SC-RIHN significantly outperforms traditional MLP, representative graph neural network variants, and ResInf baselines across synthetic benchmarks, underscoring its potential for practical, early-warning risk assessment in complex supply chain systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了稀疏线性回归问题的首个通用正结果，能够在最坏情况设计矩阵下，以多项式时间和样本复杂度实现预测误差ε。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏线性回归在信息理论上只需要O(k log d/ε)样本，但计算上需要d^Ω(k)时间，或者用O(d)样本实现多项式时间。这之间存在指数级差距，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 对于任意设计矩阵X，假设w*的支持集是随机选择的，使用poly(k, log d, 1/ε)样本和poly(d,N)运行时间来实现预测误差ε。

Result: 该算法适用于任何条件数高达2^poly(d)的设计矩阵，突破了之前只能用于随机设计矩阵或特殊结构矩阵的限制。

Conclusion: 这是第一个在最坏情况设计矩阵下实现稀疏线性回归多项式时间算法的通用结果，填补了信息理论界和计算复杂度之间的重要空白。

Abstract: Sparse linear regression is one of the most basic questions in machine learning and statistics. Here, we are given as input a design matrix $X \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times d}$ and measurements or labels ${y} \in \mathbb{R}^N$ where ${y} = {X} {w}^* + ξ$, and $ξ$ is the noise in the measurements. Importantly, we have the additional constraint that the unknown signal vector ${w}^*$ is sparse: it has $k$ non-zero entries where $k$ is much smaller than the ambient dimension. Our goal is to output a prediction vector $\widehat{w}$ that has small prediction error: $\frac{1}{N}\cdot \|{X} {w}^* - {X} \widehat{w}\|^2_2$.
  Information-theoretically, we know what is best possible in terms of measurements: under most natural noise distributions, we can get prediction error at most $ε$ with roughly $N = O(k \log d/ε)$ samples. Computationally, this currently needs $d^{Ω(k)}$ run-time. Alternately, with $N = O(d)$, we can get polynomial-time. Thus, there is an exponential gap (in the dependence on $d$) between the two and we do not know if it is possible to get $d^{o(k)}$ run-time and $o(d)$ samples.
  We give the first generic positive result for worst-case design matrices ${X}$: For any ${X}$, we show that if the support of ${w}^*$ is chosen at random, we can get prediction error $ε$ with $N = \text{poly}(k, \log d, 1/ε)$ samples and run-time $\text{poly}(d,N)$. This run-time holds for any design matrix ${X}$ with condition number up to $2^{\text{poly}(d)}$.
  Previously, such results were known for worst-case ${w}^*$, but only for random design matrices from well-behaved families, matrices that have a very low condition number ($\text{poly}(\log d)$; e.g., as studied in compressed sensing), or those with special structural properties.

Motivation: 现有图对比学习方法通常依赖固定的手工视图（局部和全局视角），限制了捕捉多尺度结构模式的能力。

Method: 使用分数阶连续动力学，通过变化分数阶导数参数α∈(0,1]生成连续谱的视图：小α产生局部特征，大α诱导更广泛的全局聚合，并将α作为可学习参数。

Conclusion: 这种基于原理的方法无需手动增强即可生成多样互补的表示，能够自动发现信息丰富的视图并适应数据的扩散尺度。

Abstract: Graph contrastive learning (GCL) learns node and graph representations by contrasting multiple views of the same graph. Existing methods typically rely on fixed, handcrafted views-usually a local and a global perspective, which limits their ability to capture multi-scale structural patterns. We present an augmentation-free, multi-view GCL framework grounded in fractional-order continuous dynamics. By varying the fractional derivative order $α\in (0,1]$, our encoders produce a continuous spectrum of views: small $α$ yields localized features, while large $α$ induces broader, global aggregation. We treat $α$ as a learnable parameter so the model can adapt diffusion scales to the data and automatically discover informative views. This principled approach generates diverse, complementary representations without manual augmentations. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method produces more robust and expressive embeddings and outperforms state-of-the-art GCL baselines.

Conclusion: 通过将DODE重新构建为顺序决策问题，该方法通过学习的策略解决了信用分配挑战，克服了传统方法的局限性，为微观交通仿真校准提供了新框架。

Abstract: This paper focuses on dynamic origin-destination matrix estimation (DODE), a crucial calibration process necessary for the effective application of microscopic traffic simulations. The fundamental challenge of the DODE problem in microscopic simulations stems from the complex temporal dynamics and inherent uncertainty of individual vehicle dynamics. This makes it highly challenging to precisely determine which vehicle traverses which link at any given moment, resulting in intricate and often ambiguous relationships between origin-destination (OD) matrices and their contributions to resultant link flows. This phenomenon constitutes the credit assignment problem, a central challenge addressed in this study. We formulate the DODE problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and propose a novel framework that applies model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Within our proposed framework, the agent learns an optimal policy to sequentially generate OD matrices, refining its strategy through direct interaction with the simulation environment. The proposed method is validated on the Nguyen-Dupuis network using SUMO, where its performance is evaluated against ground-truth link flows aggregated at 5-minute intervals over a 30-minute horizon. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves a 43.2% reduction in mean squared error (MSE) compared to the best-performing conventional baseline. By reframing DODE as a sequential decision-making problem, our approach addresses the credit assignment challenge through its learned policy, thereby overcoming the limitations of conventional methods and proposing a novel framework for calibration of microscopic traffic simulations.

Abstract: Human-computer interaction increasingly demands systems that recognize not only explicit user inputs but also implicit emotional states. While substantial progress has been made in affective computing, most emotion recognition systems rely on cloud-based inference, introducing privacy vulnerabilities and latency constraints unsuitable for real-time applications. This work presents a comprehensive evaluation of machine learning architectures for on-device emotion recognition from wrist-based photoplethysmography (PPG), systematically comparing different models spanning classical ensemble methods, deep neural networks, and transformers on the WESAD stress detection dataset. Results demonstrate that classical ensemble methods substantially outperform deep learning on small physiological datasets, with ExtraTrees achieving F1 = 0.826 on combined features and F1 = 0.623 on wrist-only features, compared to transformers achieving only F1 = 0.509-0.577. We deploy the wrist-only ExtraTrees model optimized via ONNX conversion, achieving a 4.08 MB footprint, 0.05 ms inference latency, and 152x speedup over the original implementation. Furthermore, ONNX optimization yields a 30.5% average storage reduction and 40.1x inference speedup, highlighting the feasibility of privacy-preserving on-device emotion recognition for real-world wearables.

Conclusion: 该工作为ICL涌现提供了必要和充分条件，并建立了transformer在上下文中学习能力的基本计算极限。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models to adapt to new tasks from demonstrations without parameter updates. Despite extensive empirical studies, a principled understanding of ICL emergence at scale remains more elusive. We present a unified theoretical framework connecting scaling laws to ICL emergence in transformers. Our analysis establishes that ICL performance follows power-law relationships with model depth $L$, width $d$, context length $k$, and training data $D$, with exponents determined by task structure. We show that under specific conditions, transformers implement gradient-based metalearning in their forward pass, with an effective learning rate $η_{\text{eff}} = Θ(1/\sqrt{Ld})$. We demonstrate sharp phase transitions at critical scales and derive optimal depth-width allocations favoring $L^* \propto N^{2/3}$, $d^* \propto N^{1/3}$ for the fixed parameter budget $N = Ld$. Systematic experiments on synthetic tasks validate our predictions, with measured scaling exponents closely matching theory. This work provides both necessary and sufficient conditions for the emergence of ICLs and establishes fundamental computational limits on what transformers can learn in-context.

Conclusion: MoSEs框架有效平衡了知识保留和模型扩展，为LLMs持续学习提供了实用的解决方案

Abstract: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to a continuous stream of tasks is a critical yet challenging endeavor. While Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have become a standard for this, they face a fundamental dilemma in continual learning. Reusing a single set of PEFT parameters for new tasks often leads to catastrophic forgetting of prior knowledge. Conversely, allocating distinct parameters for each task prevents forgetting but results in a linear growth of the model's size and fails to facilitate knowledge transfer between related tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel adaptive PEFT method referred to as \textit{Mixtures of SubExperts (MoSEs)}, a novel continual learning framework designed for minimal forgetting and efficient scalability. MoSEs integrate a sparse Mixture of SubExperts into the transformer layers, governed by a task-specific routing mechanism. This architecture allows the model to isolate and protect knowledge within dedicated SubExperts, thereby minimizing parameter interference and catastrophic forgetting. Crucially, the router can adaptively select and combine previously learned sparse parameters for new tasks, enabling effective knowledge transfer while ensuring that the model's capacity grows sublinearly. We evaluate MoSEs on the comprehensive TRACE benchmark datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that MoSEs significantly outperform conventional continual learning approaches in both knowledge retention and scalability to new tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance with substantial memory and computational savings.

Abstract: This paper studies optimization proxies, machine learning (ML) models trained to efficiently predict optimal solutions for AC Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF) problems. While promising, optimization proxy performance heavily depends on training data quality. To address this limitation, this paper introduces a novel active sampling framework for ACOPF optimization proxies designed to generate realistic and diverse training data. The framework actively explores varied, flexible problem specifications reflecting plausible operational realities. More importantly, the approach uses optimization-specific quantities (active constraint sets) that better capture the salient features of an ACOPF that lead to the optimal solution.

### [470] [Test-Time Iterative Error Correction for Efficient Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06250)
*Yunshan Zhong,Yanwei Qi,Yuxin Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为迭代误差校正（IEC）的测试时方法，用于缓解高效扩散模型中的近似误差累积问题，无需重新训练或架构修改。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 资源受限设备上的高效扩散模型存在近似误差，这些误差在部署后难以修正，且会在扩散时间步中指数级累积，严重影响生成质量。

Method: IEC通过在推理过程中迭代细化模型输出来校正误差，理论证明可将误差传播从指数增长降低到线性增长。

Result: 大量实验表明，IEC在各种数据集、效率技术和模型架构上都能一致提升生成质量。

Conclusion: IEC是一个实用且通用的解决方案，可在测试时增强高效扩散模型的性能，实现性能与效率的灵活权衡。

Abstract: With the growing demand for high-quality image generation on resource-constrained devices, efficient diffusion models have received increasing attention. However, such models suffer from approximation errors introduced by efficiency techniques, which significantly degrade generation quality. Once deployed, these errors are difficult to correct, as modifying the model is typically infeasible in deployment environments. Through an analysis of error propagation across diffusion timesteps, we reveal that these approximation errors can accumulate exponentially, severely impairing output quality. Motivated by this insight, we propose Iterative Error Correction (IEC), a novel test-time method that mitigates inference-time errors by iteratively refining the model's output. IEC is theoretically proven to reduce error propagation from exponential to linear growth, without requiring any retraining or architectural changes. IEC can seamlessly integrate into the inference process of existing diffusion models, enabling a flexible trade-off between performance and efficiency. Extensive experiments show that IEC consistently improves generation quality across various datasets, efficiency techniques, and model architectures, establishing it as a practical and generalizable solution for test-time enhancement of efficient diffusion models.

Result: 在理论分析中证明了MrCoM在多场景设置下的泛化误差上界；系统评估显示该方法在多样化场景中具有显著优于先前最先进方法的泛化性能。

Conclusion: MrCoM通过分解潜在状态空间和元正则化技术，成功构建了能够跨场景泛化的统一世界模型，在多样化场景中展现出优越的泛化能力。

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) is a crucial approach to enhance the generalization capabilities and improve the sample efficiency of RL algorithms. However, current MBRL methods focus primarily on building world models for single tasks and rarely address generalization across different scenarios. Building on the insight that dynamics within the same simulation engine share inherent properties, we attempt to construct a unified world model capable of generalizing across different scenarios, named Meta-Regularized Contextual World-Model (MrCoM). This method first decomposes the latent state space into various components based on the dynamic characteristics, thereby enhancing the accuracy of world-model prediction. Further, MrCoM adopts meta-state regularization to extract unified representation of scenario-relevant information, and meta-value regularization to align world-model optimization with policy learning across diverse scenario objectives. We theoretically analyze the generalization error upper bound of MrCoM in multi-scenario settings. We systematically evaluate our algorithm's generalization ability across diverse scenarios, demonstrating significantly better performance than previous state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有质谱检索方法存在谱库覆盖有限和跨模态对齐不佳的问题，导致检索准确率和泛化能力不足。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：预检索阶段使用对比学习模型识别候选分子作为上下文先验；生成检索阶段整合候选分子和输入质谱，通过生成模型产生精炼分子结构用于重排序。

Result: 在MassSpecGym和MassRET-20k数据集上，GLMR显著优于现有方法，top-1准确率提升超过40%，并展现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: GLMR通过生成式方法有效缓解跨模态对齐问题，为质谱分子结构检索提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieving molecular structures from tandem mass spectra is a crucial step in rapid compound identification. Existing retrieval methods, such as traditional mass spectral library matching, suffer from limited spectral library coverage, while recent cross-modal representation learning frameworks often encounter modality misalignment, resulting in suboptimal retrieval accuracy and generalization. To address these limitations, we propose GLMR, a Generative Language Model-based Retrieval framework that mitigates the cross-modal misalignment through a two-stage process. In the pre-retrieval stage, a contrastive learning-based model identifies top candidate molecules as contextual priors for the input mass spectrum. In the generative retrieval stage, these candidate molecules are integrated with the input mass spectrum to guide a generative model in producing refined molecular structures, which are then used to re-rank the candidates based on molecular similarity. Experiments on both MassSpecGym and the proposed MassRET-20k dataset demonstrate that GLMR significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving over 40% improvement in top-1 accuracy and exhibiting strong generalizability.

Conclusion: CAMP-HiVe方法通过动态自适应框架实现了模型复杂度与性能的良好平衡，为资源受限环境下的神经网络部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning algorithms are becoming an essential component of many artificial intelligence (AI) driven applications, many of which run on resource-constrained and energy-constrained systems. For efficient deployment of these algorithms, although different techniques for the compression of neural network models are proposed, neural pruning is one of the fastest and effective methods, which can provide a high compression gain with minimal cost. To harness enhanced performance gain with respect to model complexity, we propose a novel neural network pruning approach utilizing Hessian-vector products that approximate crucial curvature information in the loss function, which significantly reduces the computation demands. By employing a power iteration method, our algorithm effectively identifies and preserves the essential information, ensuring a balanced trade-off between model accuracy and computational efficiency. Herein, we introduce CAMP-HiVe, a cyclic pair merging-based pruning with Hessian Vector approximation by iteratively consolidating weight pairs, combining significant and less significant weights, thus effectively streamlining the model while preserving its performance. This dynamic, adaptive framework allows for real-time adjustment of weight significance, ensuring that only the most critical parameters are retained. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves significant reductions in computational requirements while maintaining high performance across different neural network architectures, e.g., ResNet18, ResNet56, and MobileNetv2, on standard benchmark datasets, e.g., CIFAR10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, and it outperforms the existing state-of-the-art neural pruning methods.

Abstract: Drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction is of great significance for drug discovery and drug repurposing. With the accumulation of a large volume of valuable data, data-driven methods have been increasingly harnessed to predict DTIs, reducing costs across various dimensions. Therefore, this paper proposes a $\textbf{L}$arge $\textbf{L}$anguage $\textbf{M}$odel and $\textbf{M}$ulti-$\textbf{M}$odel data co-powered $\textbf{D}$rug $\textbf{T}$arget $\textbf{I}$nteraction prediction framework, named LLM$^3$-DTI. LLM$^3$-DTI constructs multi-modal data embedding to enhance DTI prediction performance. In this framework, the text semantic embeddings of drugs and targets are encoded by a domain-specific LLM. To effectively align and fuse multi-modal embedding. We propose the dual cross-attention mechanism and the TSFusion module. Finally, these multi-modal data are utilized for the DTI task through an output network. The experimental results indicate that LLM$^3$-DTI can proficiently identify validated DTIs, surpassing the performance of the models employed for comparison across diverse scenarios. Consequently, LLM$^3$-DTI is adept at fulfilling the task of DTI prediction with excellence. The data and code are available at https://github.com/chaser-gua/LLM3DTI.

Result: 在电力现货市场和金融市场的广泛实验中，COTN比最先进的深度学习模型Informer性能提升高达17%，比传统统计方法GARCH提升高达40%。

Conclusion: COTN在应对现实世界市场不确定性和复杂性方面表现出色，为在压力下预测高波动系统提供了强大工具。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of financial and electricity markets, especially under extreme conditions, remains a significant challenge due to their intrinsic nonlinearity, rapid fluctuations, and chaotic patterns. To address these limitations, we propose the Chaotic Oscillatory Transformer Network (COTN). COTN innovatively combines a Transformer architecture with a novel Lee Oscillator activation function, processed through Max-over-Time pooling and a lambda-gating mechanism. This design is specifically tailored to effectively capture chaotic dynamics and improve responsiveness during periods of heightened volatility, where conventional activation functions (e.g., ReLU, GELU) tend to saturate. Furthermore, COTN incorporates an Autoencoder Self-Regressive (ASR) module to detect and isolate abnormal market patterns, such as sudden price spikes or crashes, thereby preventing corruption of the core prediction process and enhancing robustness. Extensive experiments across electricity spot markets and financial markets demonstrate the practical applicability and resilience of COTN. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning models like Informer by up to 17% and traditional statistical methods like GARCH by as much as 40%. These results underscore COTN's effectiveness in navigating real-world market uncertainty and complexity, offering a powerful tool for forecasting highly volatile systems under duress.

Motivation: 在医疗等高风险领域，现有偏见缓解技术往往在公平性和准确性之间做出权衡，这在伦理和实践上不可接受。需要一种既能确保公平性又不损害预测性能的方法。

Method: 为不同人口群体学习不同表示，构建群体特定表示和个性化分类器的人口专家，通过无害约束选择机制选择性应用这些专家。

Conclusion: 提出的公平无害方法能够在保持高预测性能的同时实现公平性，特别适用于医疗等高风险领域。

Abstract: As machine learning systems become increasingly integrated into human-centered domains such as healthcare, ensuring fairness while maintaining high predictive performance is critical. Existing bias mitigation techniques often impose a trade-off between fairness and accuracy, inadvertently degrading performance for certain demographic groups. In high-stakes domains like clinical diagnosis, such trade-offs are ethically and practically unacceptable. In this study, we propose a fairness-without-harm approach by learning distinct representations for different demographic groups and selectively applying demographic experts consisting of group-specific representations and personalized classifiers through a no-harm constrained selection. We evaluate our approach on three real-world medical datasets -- covering eye disease, skin cancer, and X-ray diagnosis -- as well as two face datasets. Extensive empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving fairness without harm.

Motivation: 现有Transformer-based神经算子中，Transolver引入的Physics-Attention虽然降低了计算复杂度，但其切片注意力可能损害模型性能，且其有效性主要来自切片和反切片操作而非切片间的交互。

Method: 通过两步变换将Physics-Attention重新设计为标准线性注意力，形成LinearNO方法，在保持物理建模能力的同时优化计算效率。

Result: 在6个标准PDE基准测试中达到SOTA性能，平均减少40.0%参数和36.2%计算成本，在AirfRANS和Shape-Net Car两个工业级数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: LinearNO证明了将Physics-Attention转化为标准线性注意力的有效性，在保持高性能的同时显著提升了效率，为PDE求解提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Transformer-based Neural Operators have enabled significant progress in data-driven solvers for Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Most current research has focused on reducing the quadratic complexity of attention to address the resulting low training and inference efficiency. Among these works, Transolver stands out as a representative method that introduces Physics-Attention to reduce computational costs. Physics-Attention projects grid points into slices for slice attention, then maps them back through deslicing. However, we observe that Physics-Attention can be reformulated as a special case of linear attention, and that the slice attention may even hurt the model performance. Based on these observations, we argue that its effectiveness primarily arises from the slice and deslice operations rather than interactions between slices. Building on this insight, we propose a two-step transformation to redesign Physics-Attention into a canonical linear attention, which we call Linear Attention Neural Operator (LinearNO). Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on six standard PDE benchmarks, while reducing the number of parameters by an average of 40.0% and computational cost by 36.2%. Additionally, it delivers superior performance on two challenging, industrial-level datasets: AirfRANS and Shape-Net Car.

Conclusion: 3dSAGER通过关注3D空间对象的固有几何特性，实现了在坐标系不兼容情况下的鲁棒地理空间实体解析。

Abstract: Urban environments are continuously mapped and modeled by various data collection platforms, including satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles and street cameras. The growing availability of 3D geospatial data from multiple modalities has introduced new opportunities and challenges for integrating spatial knowledge at scale, particularly in high-impact domains such as urban planning and rapid disaster management. Geospatial entity resolution is the task of identifying matching spatial objects across different datasets, often collected independently under varying conditions. Existing approaches typically rely on spatial proximity, textual metadata, or external identifiers to determine correspondence. While useful, these signals are often unavailable, unreliable, or misaligned, especially in cross-source scenarios. To address these limitations, we shift the focus to the intrinsic geometry of 3D spatial objects and present 3dSAGER (3D Spatial-Aware Geospatial Entity Resolution), an end-to-end pipeline for geospatial entity resolution over 3D objects. 3dSAGER introduces a novel, spatial-reference-independent featurization mechanism that captures intricate geometric characteristics of matching pairs, enabling robust comparison even across datasets with incompatible coordinate systems where traditional spatial methods fail. As a key component of 3dSAGER, we also propose a new lightweight and interpretable blocking method, BKAFI, that leverages a trained model to efficiently generate high-recall candidate sets. We validate 3dSAGER through extensive experiments on real-world urban datasets, demonstrating significant gains in both accuracy and efficiency over strong baselines. Our empirical study further dissects the contributions of each component, providing insights into their impact and the overall design choices.

Abstract: Since 2010, Kaggle has been a platform where data scientists from around the world come together to compete, collaborate, and push the boundaries of Data Science. Over these 15 years, it has grown from a purely competition-focused site into a broader ecosystem with forums, notebooks, models, datasets, and more. With the release of the Kaggle Meta Code and Kaggle Meta Datasets, we now have a unique opportunity to explore these competitions, technologies, and real-world applications of Machine Learning and AI. And so in this study, we take a closer look at 15 years of data science on Kaggle - through metadata, shared code, community discussions, and the competitions themselves. We explore Kaggle's growth, its impact on the data science community, uncover hidden technological trends, analyze competition winners, how Kagglers approach problems in general, and more. We do this by analyzing millions of kernels and discussion threads to perform both longitudinal trend analysis and standard exploratory data analysis. Our findings show that Kaggle is a steadily growing platform with increasingly diverse use cases, and that Kagglers are quick to adapt to new trends and apply them to real-world challenges, while producing - on average - models with solid generalization capabilities. We also offer a snapshot of the platform as a whole, highlighting its history and technological evolution.

Motivation: 当前推理优先模型在数学领域取得进展，但竞争性编程代码生成领域研究不足，且数据构建受到的关注少于RL算法设计。

Method: 采用监督微调+两阶段强化学习：第一阶段使用GRPO在大量问题集上训练以扩展熵；第二阶段使用Pre-GRPO在高质量难题集上集中训练，采用硬聚焦课程设计。

Result: 在LeetCode和Codeforces周赛中达到同类规模模型的最先进性能，与DeepSeek v3.1和Doubao-1.5-Thinking相当，并在大规模MoE模型上观察到强RL扩展性。

Conclusion: 研究提炼了数据构建、熵扩展和课程设计的最佳实践，为竞争性编程代码生成的RLVR提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Recent reasoning-first models (e.g., OpenAI o1, DeepSeek R1) have spurred a resurgence of interest in RLVR. Nevertheless, advances are dominated by mathematics (e.g., AIME), with competitive-programming code generation underexplored and data curation receiving less attention than RL algorithm design. We investigate how to construct RLVR datasets (i.e., RL prompts) and present practical training techniques that yield strong performance on competitive-programming code generation. Our pipeline begins with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) distilled from strong open-source models, augmented with general-purpose and reasoning-intensive data. RL then follows a two-stage process with executable, testcase-driven rewards: first, training on a large, uniformly distributed set of competitive-programming problems using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with 8 rollouts per prompt and a relatively short response-generation window (e.g., 32k during SFT and 24k in this stage) to expand entropy and mitigate repetition and truncation; second, we perform \textbf{Pre-GRPO}: updating on a small, high-quality set of challenging problems with a large rollout budget (64 rollouts per prompt) under a hard-focus curriculum that continuously retains the most difficult instances throughout training. We implement our method on Qwen2.5-32B and evaluate on LeetCode and Codeforces weekly contests to avoid data leakage. The resulting model achieves state-of-the-art performance among models of similar scale and is comparable to leading systems such as DeepSeek v3.1 and Doubao-1.5-Thinking. We also examine scaling trends and observe strong RL scaling on an internal large-scale MoE model. Our study distills concise best practices for data curation, entropy expansion, and curriculum design in RLVR for competitive-programming code generation.

Conclusion: 所提框架为神经网络CBFs提供了可扩展的验证方法，适用于任意控制仿射系统和广泛的非线性激活函数

Abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) are a popular tool for safety certification of nonlinear dynamical control systems. Recently, CBFs represented as neural networks have shown great promise due to their expressiveness and applicability to a broad class of dynamics and safety constraints. However, verifying that a trained neural network is indeed a valid CBF is a computational bottleneck that limits the size of the networks that can be used. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel framework for verifying neural CBFs based on piecewise linear upper and lower bounds on the conditions required for a neural network to be a CBF. Our approach is rooted in linear bound propagation (LBP) for neural networks, which we extend to compute bounds on the gradients of the network. Combined with McCormick relaxation, we derive linear upper and lower bounds on the CBF conditions, thereby eliminating the need for computationally expensive verification procedures. Our approach applies to arbitrary control-affine systems and a broad range of nonlinear activation functions. To reduce conservatism, we develop a parallelizable refinement strategy that adaptively refines the regions over which these bounds are computed. Our approach scales to larger neural networks than state-of-the-art verification procedures for CBFs, as demonstrated by our numerical experiments.

Motivation: 现有机器学习模型在化学反应预测中存在两个关键限制：对输入排列（分子/原子顺序）的敏感性，以及对控制反应性的子结构交互建模不足，导致预测不一致和泛化能力差。

Method: 提出ReaDISH模型，包含两个创新：(1) 对称差异shingle编码，计算分子shingle差异以捕捉反应特异性结构变化并消除顺序敏感性；(2) 几何结构交互注意力机制，在shingle级别建模分子内和分子间交互。

Result: 大量实验表明，ReaDISH在多个基准测试中提高了反应预测性能，在排列扰动下R²平均提升8.76%，显示出增强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ReaDISH通过排列不变表示和交互感知特征，有效解决了化学反应预测中的关键挑战，为有机化学中的反应预测提供了更可靠的方法。

Abstract: Chemical reaction prediction remains a fundamental challenge in organic chemistry, where existing machine learning models face two critical limitations: sensitivity to input permutations (molecule/atom orderings) and inadequate modeling of substructural interactions governing reactivity. These shortcomings lead to inconsistent predictions and poor generalization to real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose ReaDISH, a novel reaction prediction model that learns permutation-invariant representations while incorporating interaction-aware features. It introduces two innovations: (1) symmetric difference shingle encoding, which computes molecular shingle differences to capture reaction-specific structural changes while eliminating order sensitivity; and (2) geometry-structure interaction attention, a mechanism that models intra- and inter-molecular interactions at the shingle level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReaDISH improves reaction prediction performance across diverse benchmarks. It shows enhanced robustness with an average improvement of 8.76% on R$^2$ under permutation perturbations.

Abstract: The optimization of urban traffic is threatened by the complexity of achieving a balance between transport efficiency and the maintenance of privacy, as well as the equitable distribution of traffic based on socioeconomically diverse neighborhoods. Current centralized traffic management schemes invade user location privacy and further entrench traffic disparity by offering disadvantaged route suggestions, whereas current federated learning frameworks do not consider fairness constraints in multi-objective traffic settings. This study presents a privacy-preserving federated learning framework, termed FedFair-Traffic, that jointly and simultaneously optimizes travel efficiency, traffic fairness, and differential privacy protection. This is the first attempt to integrate three conflicting objectives to improve urban transportation systems. The proposed methodology enables collaborative learning between related vehicles with data locality by integrating Graph Neural Networks with differential privacy mechanisms ($ε$-privacy guarantees) and Gini coefficient-based fair constraints using multi-objective optimization. The framework uses federated aggregation methods of gradient clipping and noise injection to provide differential privacy and optimize Pareto-efficient solutions for the efficiency-fairness tradeoff. Real-world comprehensive experiments on the METR-LA traffic dataset showed that FedFair-Traffic can reduce the average travel time by 7\% (14.2 minutes) compared with their centralized baselines, promote traffic fairness by 73\% (Gini coefficient, 0.78), and offer high privacy protection (privacy score, 0.8) with an 89\% reduction in communication overhead. These outcomes demonstrate that FedFair-Traffic is a scalable privacy-aware smart city infrastructure with possible use-cases in metropolitan traffic flow control and federated transportation networks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在搜索、广告和推荐领域的CTR和CVR预估模型中，依赖大规模稀疏类别特征的模型在多轮训练时经常出现性能显著下降的问题，现有启发式解决方案未能明确识别这一现象的根本原因。

Method: 基于理论分析提出自适应正则化方法，该方法不仅能防止多轮训练时的严重性能下降，还能提升单轮训练时的模型性能。

Result: 该方法已在在线生产系统中部署应用。

Conclusion: 通过理论分析揭示了大规模稀疏类别特征导致过拟合的根本原因，并提出有效的自适应正则化解决方案。

Abstract: The one-epoch overfitting problem has drawn widespread attention, especially in CTR and CVR estimation models in search, advertising, and recommendation domains. These models which rely heavily on large-scale sparse categorical features, often suffer a significant decline in performance when trained for multiple epochs. Although recent studies have proposed heuristic solutions, they have not clearly identified the fundamental cause of this phenomenon. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis that explains why overfitting occurs in models that use large-scale sparse categorical features. Based on this analysis, we propose an adaptive regularization method to address it. Our approach not only prevents the severe performance degradation observed during multi-epoch training, but also improves model performance within a single epoch. This method has already been deployed in online production systems.

Motivation: 研究Transformer在上下文学习中的函数逼近能力，特别关注词汇表作为有限集时的情况，探讨位置编码对通用逼近性质的影响。

Method: 分析单层Transformer在词汇表上下文学习中的数学性质，比较有无位置编码两种情况下的逼近能力，并提供位置编码的充分条件。

Result: 无位置编码的单层Transformer在VICL中不具备UAP，但加入位置编码后可以实现UAP。

Conclusion: 位置编码在上下文学习的函数逼近中具有重要作用，从逼近理论角度揭示了位置编码的益处。

Abstract: Numerous studies have demonstrated that the Transformer architecture possesses the capability for in-context learning (ICL). In scenarios involving function approximation, context can serve as a control parameter for the model, endowing it with the universal approximation property (UAP). In practice, context is represented by tokens from a finite set, referred to as a vocabulary, which is the case considered in this paper, \emph{i.e.}, vocabulary in-context learning (VICL). We demonstrate that VICL in single-layer Transformers, without positional encoding, does not possess the UAP; however, it is possible to achieve the UAP when positional encoding is included. Several sufficient conditions for the positional encoding are provided. Our findings reveal the benefits of positional encoding from an approximation theory perspective in the context of ICL.

TL;DR: 提出了上下文引导的测试时强化学习（CG-TTRL），通过在TTRL的两个采样阶段动态集成上下文，提高了伪标签准确性并调节探索过程，在数学和科学QA基准测试中表现优于TTRL。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TTRL的两阶段采样策略未充分利用上下文指导，而上下文学习在推理时已被证明能提升模型性能。上下文指导可以改善初始开发阶段的伪标签准确性，并在第二阶段调节探索过程。

Method: CG-TTRL将上下文动态集成到两个采样阶段，并提出了用于设备上应用的高效上下文选择方法。

Conclusion: 上下文引导的TTRL方法有效提升了测试时强化学习的性能和效率，证明了上下文集成在TTRL框架中的价值。

Abstract: Test-time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL) has shown promise in adapting foundation models for complex tasks at test-time, resulting in large performance improvements. TTRL leverages an elegant two-phase sampling strategy: first, multi-sampling derives a pseudo-label via majority voting, while subsequent downsampling and reward-based fine-tuning encourages the model to explore and learn diverse valid solutions, with the pseudo-label modulating the reward signal. Meanwhile, in-context learning has been widely explored at inference time and demonstrated the ability to enhance model performance without weight updates. However, TTRL's two-phase sampling strategy under-utilizes contextual guidance, which can potentially improve pseudo-label accuracy in the initial exploitation phase while regulating exploration in the second. To address this, we propose context-guided TTRL (CG-TTRL), integrating context dynamically into both sampling phases and propose a method for efficient context selection for on-device applications. Our evaluations on mathematical and scientific QA benchmarks show CG-TTRL outperforms TTRL (e.g. additional 7% relative accuracy improvement over TTRL), while boosting efficiency by obtaining strong performance after only a few steps of test-time training (e.g. 8% relative improvement rather than 1% over TTRL after 3 steps).

TL;DR: 提出C3E框架，通过信息论方法优化图神经网络的隐藏维度和传播深度选择，缓解过压缩问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图神经网络依赖启发式选择隐藏维度和传播深度，导致传播过程中严重的信息丢失（过压缩问题）

Method: 将隐藏维度和深度选择建模为基于信息论的非线性规划问题，将谱图神经网络建模为通信通道，连接通道容量与隐藏维度、传播深度、传播机制和图结构

Result: 在9个公共数据集上的实验表明，C3E估计的隐藏维度和深度能缓解过压缩并持续改进表示学习；发现过压缩源于表示矩阵中信息的累积压缩；增加隐藏维度确实缓解信息压缩，而传播深度的作用更为复杂

Conclusion: 揭示了信息压缩与表示复杂性之间的基本平衡，为图神经网络设计提供了理论基础

Abstract: Existing graph neural networks typically rely on heuristic choices for hidden dimensions and propagation depths, which often lead to severe information loss during propagation, known as over-squashing. To address this issue, we propose Channel Capacity Constrained Estimation (C3E), a novel framework that formulates the selection of hidden dimensions and depth as a nonlinear programming problem grounded in information theory. Through modeling spectral graph neural networks as communication channels, our approach directly connects channel capacity to hidden dimensions, propagation depth, propagation mechanism, and graph structure. Extensive experiments on nine public datasets demonstrate that hidden dimensions and depths estimated by C3E can mitigate over-squashing and consistently improve representation learning. Experimental results show that over-squashing occurs due to the cumulative compression of information in representation matrices. Furthermore, our findings show that increasing hidden dimensions indeed mitigate information compression, while the role of propagation depth is more nuanced, uncovering a fundamental balance between information compression and representation complexity.

Result: 在AIME25上提升23%，USPTO50k上提升10%，ProteinGym上提升14%，并发现了经验增长的缩放规律和跨智能体经验继承现象。

Conclusion: FLEX标志着向可扩展和可继承的持续智能体进化迈出了一步。

Abstract: Autonomous agents driven by Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized reasoning and problem-solving but remain static after training, unable to grow with experience as intelligent beings do during deployment. We introduce Forward Learning with EXperience (FLEX), a gradient-free learning paradigm that enables LLM agents to continuously evolve through accumulated experience. Specifically, FLEX cultivates scalable and inheritable evolution by constructing a structured experience library through continual reflection on successes and failures during interaction with the environment. FLEX delivers substantial improvements on mathematical reasoning, chemical retrosynthesis, and protein fitness prediction (up to 23% on AIME25, 10% on USPTO50k, and 14% on ProteinGym). We further identify a clear scaling law of experiential growth and the phenomenon of experience inheritance across agents, marking a step toward scalable and inheritable continuous agent evolution.

Motivation: 需要开发一个能够同时学习SPX和VIX期限结构的模型，同时严格满足无套利约束，以解决现有方法在套利约束和长期泛化方面的不足。

Method: 结合算子学习与约束解码器，使用外梯度风格更新加投影训练，强制执行静态套利约束、Lipschitz边界和单调性。

Result: 在历史SPX和VIX数据上优于傅里叶神经算子、DeepONet和状态空间序列模型，消融研究表明绑定SPX-VIX腿减少Dual-Gap并改善NI。

Conclusion: ARBITER提供了一个实用的无套利插值和外推方法，在期限和行权价上都能保持无套利性质，并通过投影稳定校准过程。

Abstract: We propose ARBITER, a risk-neutral neural operator for learning joint SPX-VIX term structures under no-arbitrage constraints. ARBITER maps market states to an operator that outputs implied volatility and variance curves while enforcing static arbitrage (calendar, vertical, butterfly), Lipschitz bounds, and monotonicity. The model couples operator learning with constrained decoders and is trained with extragradient-style updates plus projection. We introduce evaluation metrics for derivatives term structures (NAS, CNAS, NI, Dual-Gap, Stability Rate) and show gains over Fourier Neural Operator, DeepONet, and state-space sequence models on historical SPX and VIX data. Ablation studies indicate that tying the SPX and VIX legs reduces Dual-Gap and improves NI, Lipschitz projection stabilizes calibration, and selective state updates improve long-horizon generalization. We provide identifiability and approximation results and describe practical recipes for arbitrage-free interpolation and extrapolation across maturities and strikes.

Abstract: Although multimodal fusion has made significant progress, its advancement is severely hindered by the lack of adequate evaluation benchmarks. Current fusion methods are typically evaluated on a small selection of public datasets, a limited scope that inadequately represents the complexity and diversity of real-world scenarios, potentially leading to biased evaluations. This issue presents a twofold challenge. On one hand, models may overfit to the biases of specific datasets, hindering their generalization to broader practical applications. On the other hand, the absence of a unified evaluation standard makes fair and objective comparisons between different fusion methods difficult. Consequently, a truly universal and high-performance fusion model has yet to emerge. To address these challenges, we have developed a large-scale, domain-adaptive benchmark for multimodal evaluation. This benchmark integrates over 30 datasets, encompassing 15 modalities and 20 predictive tasks across key application domains. To complement this, we have also developed an open-source, unified, and automated evaluation pipeline that includes standardized implementations of state-of-the-art models and diverse fusion paradigms. Leveraging this platform, we have conducted large-scale experiments, successfully establishing new performance baselines across multiple tasks. This work provides the academic community with a crucial platform for rigorous and reproducible assessment of multimodal models, aiming to propel the field of multimodal artificial intelligence to new heights.

Conclusion: 该研究为近似距离查询下的目标定位问题提供了理论框架，揭示了最优重建误差的几何本质和不同空间类型的渐近行为特征。

Abstract: Consider the task of locating an unknown target point using approximate distance queries: in each round, a reconstructor selects a query point and receives a noisy version of its distance to the target. This problem arises naturally in various contexts ranging from localization in GPS and sensor networks to privacy-aware data access, and spans a wide variety of metric spaces. It is relevant from the perspective of both the reconstructor (seeking accurate recovery) and the responder (aiming to limit information disclosure, e.g., for privacy or security reasons). We study this reconstruction game through a learning-theoretic lens, focusing on the rate and limits of the best possible reconstruction error. Our first result provides a tight geometric characterization of the optimal error in terms of the Chebyshev radius, a classical concept from geometry. This characterization applies to all compact metric spaces (in fact, even to all totally bounded spaces) and yields explicit formulas for natural metric spaces. Our second result addresses the asymptotic behavior of reconstruction, distinguishing between pseudo-finite spaces -- where the optimal error is attained after finitely many queries -- and spaces where the approximation curve exhibits nontrivial decay. We characterize pseudo-finiteness for convex Euclidean spaces.

Conclusion: NDDV方法在理论上具有稳定性保证，能够实现次线性收敛，为数据估值提供了可靠的理论基础。

Abstract: Data valuation quantifies data importance, but existing methods cannot ensure validity in a single training process. The neural dynamic data valuation (NDDV) method [3] addresses this limitation. Based on NDDV, we are the first to explore error estimation and convergence analysis in data valuation. Under Lipschitz and smoothness assumptions, we derive quadratic error bounds for loss differences that scale inversely with time steps and quadratically with control variations, ensuring stability. We also prove that the expected squared gradient norm for the training loss vanishes asymptotically, and that the meta loss converges sublinearly over iterations. In particular, NDDV achieves sublinear convergence.

Conclusion: 投影分裂积分器方法能够有效构建Fisher矩阵预处理器，DyKAF在保持内存效率的同时显著提升了优化性能

Abstract: Recently, optimizers that explicitly treat weights as matrices, rather than flattened vectors, have demonstrated their effectiveness. This perspective naturally leads to structured approximations of the Fisher matrix as preconditioners, where the matrix view induces a Kronecker-factorized form that enables memory-efficient representation. However, constructing such approximations both efficiently and accurately remains an open challenge, since obtaining the optimal factorization is resource-intensive and practical methods therefore rely on heuristic design choices. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that leverages projector-splitting integrators to construct effective preconditioners. Our optimizer, DyKAF (Dynamical Kronecker Approximation of the Fisher Matrix), consistently improves the Fisher matrix approximation quality. Experiments on large language model pre-training and fine-tuning demonstrate that DyKAF outperforms existing optimizers across a range of evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: 基于Koopman自编码器的框架为处理时变图数据提供了一种有效方法，能够在潜在空间中学习非线性动态系统，适用于图演化的预测和缺失数据的重建。

Abstract: A wide variety of real-world data, such as sea measurements, e.g., temperatures collected by distributed sensors and multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) trajectories, can be naturally represented as graphs, often exhibiting non-Euclidean structures. These graph representations may evolve over time, forming time-varying graphs. Effectively modeling and analyzing such dynamic graph data is critical for tasks like predicting graph evolution and reconstructing missing graph data. In this paper, we propose a framework based on the Koopman autoencoder (KAE) to handle time-varying graph data. Specifically, we assume the existence of a hidden non-linear dynamical system, where the state vector corresponds to the graph embedding of the time-varying graph signals. To capture the evolving graph structures, the graph data is first converted into a vector time series through graph embedding, representing the structural information in a finite-dimensional latent space. In this latent space, the KAE is applied to learn the underlying non-linear dynamics governing the temporal evolution of graph features, enabling both prediction and reconstruction tasks.

TL;DR: SeqTopK是一种序列级TopK路由方法，通过将专家预算从token级转移到序列级，实现端到端学习的动态专家分配，无需额外模块或重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准TopK路由为所有token分配固定数量的专家，忽略了token复杂度的差异，而现有自适应路由方法需要额外模块和超参数调整，且通常需要从头重新训练。

Method: 提出SeqTopK方法，在所有T个token中选择前T·K个专家，保持总体预算不变，但允许动态分配更多专家给复杂token、更少专家给简单token。

Result: 在数学、编程、法律和写作任务上相比TopK和先前的无参数自适应方法都有持续改进，在更高稀疏度下提升更显著（最高达16.9%）。

Conclusion: SeqTopK是一种简单、高效且可扩展的路由策略，特别适合下一代LLM的极端稀疏机制，仅需少量代码修改，增加不到1%的开销，且完全兼容预训练的MoE模型。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures scale large language models (LLMs) by activating only a subset of experts per token, but the standard TopK routing assigns the same fixed number of experts to all tokens, ignoring their varying complexity. Prior adaptive routing methods introduce additional modules and hyperparameters, often requiring costly retraining from scratch. We propose Sequence-level TopK (SeqTopK), a minimal modification that shifts the expert budget from the token level to the sequence level. By selecting the top $T \cdot K$ experts across all $T$ tokens, SeqTopK enables end-to-end learned dynamic allocation -- assigning more experts to difficult tokens and fewer to easy ones -- while preserving the same overall budget. SeqTopK requires only a few lines of code, adds less than 1% overhead, and remains fully compatible with pretrained MoE models. Experiments across math, coding, law, and writing show consistent improvements over TopK and prior parameter-free adaptive methods, with gains that become substantially larger under higher sparsity (up to 16.9%). These results highlight SeqTopK as a simple, efficient, and scalable routing strategy, particularly well-suited for the extreme sparsity regimes of next-generation LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/Y-Research-SBU/SeqTopK.

Motivation: 当前时间序列预测领域存在两种主流方法：微调基于文本的大语言模型和从头训练时间序列基础模型。两者都假设扩大模型容量和数据量会提高性能，但作者观察到"规模悖论"现象——更大的模型并没有获得更好的性能。

Method: 通过分析内部表征，识别出"少数层主导"现象：只有一小部分层是功能重要的，大多数层是冗余的。提出自动识别和保留主导层的实用方法。

Result: 在8个最先进的模型上验证了方法的通用性，保留不到30%的层在95%以上的任务中达到相当或更优的精度。仅保留21%参数就能实现12%精度提升和2.7倍推理加速。

Conclusion: 时间序列模型存在普遍的规模悖论问题，少数层主导是根本原因。提出的主导层保留方法能有效解决这一问题，在显著减少参数的同时提升性能和效率。

Abstract: Large-scale models are at the forefront of time series (TS) forecasting, dominated by two paradigms: fine-tuning text-based Large Language Models (LLM4TS) and training Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) from scratch. Both approaches share a foundational assumption that scaling up model capacity and data volume leads to improved performance. However, we observe a \textit{\textbf{scaling paradox}} in TS models, revealing a puzzling phenomenon that larger models do \emph{NOT} achieve better performance. Through extensive experiments on two model families across four scales (100M to 1.7B parameters) and diverse data (up to 6B observations), we rigorously confirm that the scaling paradox is a pervasive issue. We then diagnose its root cause by analyzing internal representations, identifying a phenomenon we call \textit{few-layer dominance}: only a small subset of layers are functionally important, while the majority are redundant, under-utilized, and can even distract training. Based on this discovery, we propose a practical method to automatically identify and retain only these dominant layers. In our models, retaining only 21\% of the parameters achieves up to a 12\% accuracy improvement and a 2.7$\times$ inference speedup. We validate the universality of our method on 8 prominent SOTA models (LLM4TS and TSFMs, 90M to 6B), showing that retaining less than 30\% of layers achieves comparable or superior accuracy in over 95\% of tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法为对抗鲁棒性提供了高效的概率性认证框架，突破了传统方法在规模和复杂性上的限制。

Abstract: We propose and investigate probabilistic guarantees for the adversarial robustness of classification algorithms. While traditional formal verification approaches for robustness are intractable and sampling-based approaches do not provide formal guarantees, our approach is able to efficiently certify a probabilistic relaxation of robustness. The key idea is to sample an $ε$-net and invoke a local robustness oracle on the sample. Remarkably, the size of the sample needed to achieve probably approximately global robustness guarantees is independent of the input dimensionality, the number of classes, and the learning algorithm itself. Our approach can, therefore, be applied even to large neural networks that are beyond the scope of traditional formal verification. Experiments empirically confirm that it characterizes robustness better than state-of-the-art sampling-based approaches and scales better than formal methods.

Abstract: The identification of high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems via the Volterra series has significant potential, but has been severely hindered by the curse of dimensionality. Tensor Network (TN) methods such as the Modified Alternating Linear Scheme (MVMALS) have been a breakthrough for the field, offering a tractable approach by exploiting the low-rank structure in Volterra kernels. However, these techniques still encounter prohibitive computational and memory bottlenecks due to high-order polynomial scaling with respect to input dimension. To overcome this barrier, we introduce the Tensor Head Averaging (THA) algorithm, which significantly reduces complexity by constructing an ensemble of localized MVMALS models trained on small subsets of the input space. In this paper, we present a theoretical foundation for the THA algorithm. We establish observable, finite-sample bounds on the error between the THA ensemble and a full MVMALS model, and we derive an exact decomposition of the squared error. This decomposition is used to analyze the manner in which subset models implicitly compensate for omitted dynamics. We quantify this effect, and prove that correlation between the included and omitted dynamics creates an optimization incentive which drives THA's performance toward accuracy superior to a simple truncation of a full MVMALS model. THA thus offers a scalable and theoretically grounded approach for identifying previously intractable high-dimensional systems.

Abstract: Reliability and failure detection of large language models (LLMs) is critical for their deployment in high-stakes, multi-step reasoning tasks. Prior work explores confidence estimation for self-evaluating LLM-scorer systems, with confidence scorers estimating the likelihood of errors in LLM responses. However, most methods focus on single-step outputs and overlook the challenges of multi-step reasoning. In this work, we extend self-evaluation techniques to multi-step tasks, testing two intuitive approaches: holistic scoring and step-by-step scoring. Using two multi-step benchmark datasets, we show that stepwise evaluation generally outperforms holistic scoring in detecting potential errors, with up to 15% relative increase in AUC-ROC. Our findings demonstrate that self-evaluating LLM systems provide meaningful confidence estimates in complex reasoning, improving their trustworthiness and providing a practical framework for failure detection.

Abstract: In decision-making processes, stakeholders often rely on counterfactual explanations, which provide suggestions about what should be changed in the queried instance to alter the outcome of an AI system. However, generating these explanations for multivariate time series presents challenges due to their complex, multi-dimensional nature. Traditional Nearest Unlike Neighbor-based methods typically substitute subsequences in a queried time series with influential subsequences from an NUN, which is not always realistic in real-world scenarios due to the rigid direct substitution. Counterfactual with Residual Generative Adversarial Networks-based methods aim to address this by learning from the distribution of observed data to generate synthetic counterfactual explanations. However, these methods primarily focus on minimizing the cost from the queried time series to the counterfactual explanations and often neglect the importance of distancing the counterfactual explanation from the decision boundary. This oversight can result in explanations that no longer qualify as counterfactual if minor changes occur within the model. To generate a more robust counterfactual explanation, we introduce TriShGAN, under the CounteRGAN framework enhanced by the incorporation of triplet loss. This unsupervised learning approach uses distance metric learning to encourage the counterfactual explanations not only to remain close to the queried time series but also to capture the feature distribution of the instance with the desired outcome, thereby achieving a better balance between minimal cost and robustness. Additionally, we integrate a Shapelet Extractor that strategically selects the most discriminative parts of the high-dimensional queried time series to enhance the sparsity of counterfactual explanation and efficiency of the training process.

Conclusion: 该方法在准确性、校准性和系统效率之间取得了平衡，为生产级电动汽车能量管理提供了可靠的续航估计和决策支持。

Abstract: Accurate EV power estimation underpins range prediction and energy management, yet practitioners need both point accuracy and trustworthy uncertainty. We propose an anchored-ensemble Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with a Student-t likelihood that jointly captures epistemic (model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainty. Anchoring imposes a Gaussian weight prior (MAP training), yielding posterior-like diversity without test-time sampling, while the t-head provides heavy-tailed robustness and closed-form prediction intervals. Using vehicle-kinematic time series (e.g., speed, motor RPM), our model attains strong accuracy: RMSE 3.36 +/- 1.10, MAE 2.21 +/- 0.89, R-squared = 0.93 +/- 0.02, explained variance 0.93 +/- 0.02, and delivers well-calibrated uncertainty bands with near-nominal coverage. Against competitive baselines (Student-t MC dropout; quantile regression with/without anchoring), our method matches or improves log-scores while producing sharper intervals at the same coverage. Crucially for real-time deployment, inference is a single deterministic pass per ensemble member (or a weight-averaged collapse), eliminating Monte Carlo latency. The result is a compact, theoretically grounded estimator that couples accuracy, calibration, and systems efficiency, enabling reliable range estimation and decision-making for production EV energy management.

Abstract: Adopting artificial intelligence (AI) in radio access networks (RANs) presents several challenges, including limited availability of link-level measurements (e.g., CQI reports), stringent real-time processing constraints (e.g., sub-1 ms per TTI), and network heterogeneity (different spectrum bands, cell types, and vendor equipment). A critical yet often overlooked barrier lies in the computational and memory limitations of RAN baseband hardware, particularly in legacy 4th Generation (4G) systems, which typically lack on-chip neural accelerators. As a result, only lightweight AI models (under 1 Mb and sub-100~μs inference time) can be effectively deployed, limiting both their performance and applicability. However, achieving strong generalization across diverse network conditions often requires large-scale models with substantial resource demands. To address this trade-off, this paper investigates policy distillation in the context of a reinforcement learning-based link adaptation task. We explore two strategies: single-policy distillation, where a scenario-agnostic teacher model is compressed into one generalized student model; and multi-policy distillation, where multiple scenario-specific teachers are consolidated into a single generalist student. Experimental evaluations in a high-fidelity, 5th Generation (5G)-compliant simulator demonstrate that both strategies produce compact student models that preserve the teachers' generalization capabilities while complying with the computational and memory limitations of existing RAN hardware.

Conclusion: 二元公平性框架存在局限性，需要更全面的评估方法，提出的后处理方法在公平性和效用性方面表现优异。

Abstract: Link prediction is a fundamental task in graph machine learning with applications, ranging from social recommendation to knowledge graph completion. Fairness in this setting is critical, as biased predictions can exacerbate societal inequalities. Prior work adopts a dyadic definition of fairness, enforcing fairness through demographic parity between intra-group and inter-group link predictions. However, we show that this dyadic framing can obscure underlying disparities across subgroups, allowing systemic biases to go undetected. Moreover, we argue that demographic parity does not meet desired properties for fairness assessment in ranking-based tasks such as link prediction. We formalize the limitations of existing fairness evaluations and propose a framework that enables a more expressive assessment. Additionally, we propose a lightweight post-processing method combined with decoupled link predictors that effectively mitigates bias and achieves state-of-the-art fairness-utility trade-offs.

Conclusion: 乐观在线到批量转换方法有效简化了在线算法设计，保持了最优收敛性能，并与Nesterov加速梯度方法建立了精确对应，为理解加速机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: In this work, we study offline convex optimization with smooth objectives, where the classical Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient (NAG) method achieves the optimal accelerated convergence. Extensive research has aimed to understand NAG from various perspectives, and a recent line of work approaches this from the viewpoint of online learning and online-to-batch conversion, emphasizing the role of optimistic online algorithms for acceleration. In this work, we contribute to this perspective by proposing novel optimistic online-to-batch conversions that incorporate optimism theoretically into the analysis, thereby significantly simplifying the online algorithm design while preserving the optimal convergence rates. Specifically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our conversions through the following results: (i) when combined with simple online gradient descent, our optimistic conversion achieves the optimal accelerated convergence; (ii) our conversion also applies to strongly convex objectives, and by leveraging both optimistic online-to-batch conversion and optimistic online algorithms, we achieve the optimal accelerated convergence rate for strongly convex and smooth objectives, for the first time through the lens of online-to-batch conversion; (iii) our optimistic conversion can achieve universality to smoothness -- applicable to both smooth and non-smooth objectives without requiring knowledge of the smoothness coefficient -- and remains efficient as non-universal methods by using only one gradient query in each iteration. Finally, we highlight the effectiveness of our optimistic online-to-batch conversions by a precise correspondence with NAG.

Conclusion: 自适应残差方案能有效提升图神经网络的表达能力，特别是在异配图上，且启发式变体在保持性能的同时降低了计算复杂度。

Abstract: Message passing is the core operation in graph neural networks, where each node updates its embeddings by aggregating information from its neighbors. However, in deep architectures, this process often leads to diminished expressiveness. A popular solution is to use residual connections, where the input from the current (or initial) layer is added to aggregated neighbor information to preserve embeddings across layers. Following a recent line of research, we investigate an adaptive residual scheme in which different nodes have varying residual strengths. We prove that this approach prevents oversmoothing; particularly, we show that the Dirichlet energy of the embeddings remains bounded away from zero. This is the first theoretical guarantee not only for the adaptive setting, but also for static residual connections (where residual strengths are shared across nodes) with activation functions. Furthermore, extensive experiments show that this adaptive approach outperforms standard and state-of-the-art message passing mechanisms, especially on heterophilic graphs. To improve the time complexity of our approach, we introduce a variant in which residual strengths are not learned but instead set heuristically, a choice that performs as well as the learnable version.

Abstract: Lost circulation remains a major and costly challenge in drilling operations, often resulting in wellbore instability, stuck pipe, and extended non-productive time. Accurate prediction of fluid loss is therefore essential for improving drilling safety and efficiency. This study presents a probabilistic machine learning framework based on Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) for predicting drilling fluid loss in complex formations. The GPR model captures nonlinear dependencies among drilling parameters while quantifying predictive uncertainty, offering enhanced reliability for high-risk decision-making. Model hyperparameters are optimized using the Limited memory Broyden Fletcher Goldfarb Shanno (LBFGS) algorithm to ensure numerical stability and robust generalization. To improve interpretability, Local Interpretable Model agnostic Explanations (LIME) are employed to elucidate how individual features influence model predictions. The results highlight the potential of explainable probabilistic learning for proactive identification of lost-circulation risks, optimized design of lost circulation materials (LCM), and reduction of operational uncertainties in drilling applications.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved significant success in addressing node classification tasks. However, the effectiveness of traditional GNNs degrades on heterophilic graphs, where connected nodes often belong to different labels or properties. While recent work has introduced mechanisms to improve GNN performance under heterophily, certain key limitations still exist. Most existing models apply a fixed aggregation depth across all nodes, overlooking the fact that nodes may require different propagation depths based on their local homophily levels and neighborhood structures. Moreover, many methods are tailored to either homophilic or heterophilic settings, lacking the flexibility to generalize across both regimes. To address these challenges, we develop a theoretical framework that links local structural and label characteristics to information propagation dynamics at the node level. Our analysis shows that optimal aggregation depth varies across nodes and is critical for preserving class-discriminative information. Guided by this insight, we propose a novel adaptive-depth GNN architecture that dynamically selects node-specific aggregation depths using theoretically grounded metrics. Our method seamlessly adapts to both homophilic and heterophilic patterns within a unified model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently enhances the performance of standard GNN backbones across diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of complex high-dimensional dynamical systems from observational data is essential for several applications across science and engineering. A key challenge, however, is that real-world measurements are often corrupted by noise, which severely degrades the performance of data-driven models. Particularly, in chaotic dynamical systems, where small errors amplify rapidly, it is challenging to identify a data-driven model from noisy data that achieves short-term accuracy while preserving long-term invariant properties. In this paper, we propose the use of the weak formulation as a complementary approach to the classical strong formulation of data-driven time-series forecasting models. Specifically, we focus on the neural ordinary differential equation (NODE) architecture. Unlike the standard strong formulation, which relies on the discretization of the NODE followed by optimization, the weak formulation constrains the model using a set of integrated residuals over temporal subdomains. While such a formulation yields an effective NODE model, we discover that the performance of a NODE can be further enhanced by employing this weak formulation as a penalty alongside the classical strong formulation-based learning. Through numerical demonstrations, we illustrate that our proposed training strategy, which we coined as the Weak-Penalty NODE (WP-NODE), achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy and exceptional robustness across benchmark chaotic dynamical systems.

Conclusion: EnFo为企业在不损害核心分析优势的前提下进行战略合作提供了实用解决方案，将非竞争性数据转化为竞争性产品。

Abstract: The non-rival nature of data creates a dilemma for firms: sharing data unlocks value but risks eroding competitive advantage. Existing data synthesis methods often exacerbate this problem by creating data with symmetric utility, allowing any party to extract its value. This paper introduces the Encapsulation-Forging (EnFo) framework, a novel approach to generate rival synthetic data with asymmetric utility. EnFo operates in two stages: it first encapsulates predictive knowledge from the original data into a designated ``key'' model, and then forges a synthetic dataset by optimizing the data to intentionally overfit this key model. This process transforms non-rival data into a rival product, ensuring its value is accessible only to the intended model, thereby preventing unauthorized use and preserving the data owner's competitive edge. Our framework demonstrates remarkable sample efficiency, matching the original data's performance with a fraction of its size, while providing robust privacy protection and resistance to misuse. EnFo offers a practical solution for firms to collaborate strategically without compromising their core analytical advantage.

Abstract: Road network representation learning (RNRL) has attracted increasing attention from both researchers and practitioners as various spatiotemporal tasks are emerging. Recent advanced methods leverage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and contrastive learning to characterize the spatial structure of road segments in a self-supervised paradigm. However, spatial heterogeneity and temporal dynamics of road networks raise severe challenges to the neighborhood smoothing mechanism of self-supervised GNNs. To address these issues, we propose a $\textbf{D}$ual-branch $\textbf{S}$patial-$\textbf{T}$emporal self-supervised representation framework for enhanced road representations, termed as DST. On one hand, DST designs a mix-hop transition matrix for graph convolution to incorporate dynamic relations of roads from trajectories. Besides, DST contrasts road representations of the vanilla road network against that of the hypergraph in a spatial self-supervised way. The hypergraph is newly built based on three types of hyperedges to capture long-range relations. On the other hand, DST performs next token prediction as the temporal self-supervised task on the sequences of traffic dynamics based on a causal Transformer, which is further regularized by differentiating traffic modes of weekdays from those of weekends. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art methods verify the superiority of our proposed framework. Moreover, the comprehensive spatiotemporal modeling facilitates DST to excel in zero-shot learning scenarios.

Conclusion: CaberNet通过因果不变表示学习，为跨域HVAC能耗预测提供了一种无需先验知识的数据驱动解决方案，显著提升了预测精度和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Cross-domain HVAC energy prediction is essential for scalable building energy management, particularly because collecting extensive labeled data for every new building is both costly and impractical. Yet, this task remains highly challenging due to the scarcity and heterogeneity of data across different buildings, climate zones, and seasonal patterns. In particular, buildings situated in distinct climatic regions introduce variability that often leads existing methods to overfit to spurious correlations, rely heavily on expert intervention, or compromise on data diversity. To address these limitations, we propose CaberNet, a causal and interpretable deep sequence model that learns invariant (Markov blanket) representations for robust cross-domain prediction. In a purely data-driven fashion and without requiring any prior knowledge, CaberNet integrates i) a global feature gate trained with a self-supervised Bernoulli regularization to distinguish superior causal features from inferior ones, and ii) a domain-wise training scheme that balances domain contributions, minimizes cross-domain loss variance, and promotes latent factor independence. We evaluate CaberNet on real-world datasets collected from three buildings located in three climatically diverse cities, and it consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving a 22.9\% reduction in normalized mean squared error (NMSE) compared to the best benchmark.

Motivation: 传统分类中的迁移学习已被广泛研究，但在不平衡分类如Neyman-Pearson分类中的迁移学习关注较少。该设置面临独特挑战，需要同时控制两种类型的错误。现有工作只处理μ₁的分布偏移，而实际场景中μ₀和μ₁都可能发生偏移。

Method: 推导了一种自适应程序，不仅保证在源数据信息丰富时改进Type-I和Type-II错误，还能自动适应源数据无信息的情况，避免负迁移。

Result: 该方法具有统计保证，能够有效控制两种错误类型，并通过补充的计算保证证明了其效率。

Conclusion: 提出的自适应方法解决了Neyman-Pearson分类中迁移学习的挑战，在保持统计性能的同时确保了计算效率。

Abstract: We consider the problem of transfer learning in Neyman-Pearson classification, where the objective is to minimize the error w.r.t. a distribution $μ_1$, subject to the constraint that the error w.r.t. a distribution $μ_0$ remains below a prescribed threshold. While transfer learning has been extensively studied in traditional classification, transfer learning in imbalanced classification such as Neyman-Pearson classification has received much less attention. This setting poses unique challenges, as both types of errors must be simultaneously controlled. Existing works address only the case of distribution shift in $μ_1$, whereas in many practical scenarios shifts may occur in both $μ_0$ and $μ_1$. We derive an adaptive procedure that not only guarantees improved Type-I and Type-II errors when the source is informative, but also automatically adapt to situations where the source is uninformative, thereby avoiding negative transfer. In addition to such statistical guarantees, the procedures is efficient, as shown via complementary computational guarantees.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个机器学习框架，用于预测哪些饮料客户在获得冷却器后最有可能实现销量增长，从而提高资产分配的投资回报率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在快速消费品行业，物理资产（如商业饮料冷却器）的放置位置直接影响收入增长和执行效率。虽然B2B背景下的流失预测和需求预测已被广泛研究，但使用机器学习指导资产分配仍相对未被探索。

Method: 使用来自中美洲知名酿酒和饮料公司的3,119个B2B传统贸易渠道客户的私有数据集，跟踪冷却器安装前后12个月的销售交易。定义了10%、30%和50%三个销量同比增长阈值。比较了XGBoost、LightGBM和CatBoost等机器学习模型，并结合SHAP进行可解释的特征分析。

Result: 最佳模型在验证集上的AUC得分分别为0.857、0.877和0.898。模拟表明，与传统基于销量的方法相比，该方法能更好地选择有增长潜力的客户，提高投资回报率，并通过不分配给不会增长的客户来增加成本节约。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效识别最有可能从冷却器分配中受益的客户，为改善业务运营和资产分配决策提供了实用的机器学习解决方案。

Abstract: In the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry, deciding where to place physical assets, such as commercial beverage coolers, can directly impact revenue growth and execution efficiency. Although churn prediction and demand forecasting have been widely studied in B2B contexts, the use of machine learning to guide asset allocation remains relatively unexplored. This paper presents a framework focused on predicting which beverage clients are most likely to deliver strong returns in volume after receiving a cooler. Using a private dataset from a well-known Central American brewing and beverage company of 3,119 B2B traditional trade channel clients that received a cooler from 2022-01 to 2024-07, and tracking 12 months of sales transactions before and after cooler installation, three growth thresholds were defined: 10%, 30% and 50% growth in sales volume year over year. The analysis compares results of machine learning models such as XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost combined with SHAP for interpretable feature analysis in order to have insights into improving business operations related to cooler allocation; the results show that the best model has AUC scores of 0.857, 0.877, and 0.898 across the thresholds on the validation set. Simulations suggest that this approach can improve ROI because it better selects potential clients to grow at the expected level and increases cost savings by not assigning clients that will not grow, compared to traditional volume-based approaches with substantial business management recommendations

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有药物相互作用预测模型存在局限性：基于知识图谱的方法无法处理未知药物，基于电子健康记录的方法存在噪声、时间依赖和站点依赖问题。需要开发能够结合两者优势的新方法。

Method: 使用融合教师模型学习知识图谱和电子健康记录中的药物关系，然后蒸馏为仅依赖电子健康记录的学生模型进行零样本推理。采用共享药理学机制本体论，生成可解释的警报而非不透明的风险评分。

Result: 在多机构数据集上评估显示，系统保持高精度，产生机制特异性预测，减少误报，在保持总体检测性能的同时漏报更少真实相互作用。零样本识别能力验证了临床实用性。

Conclusion: 该系统能够有效识别知识图谱中未见药物的临床相关药物相互作用机制，支持临床决策支持和药物警戒的实际应用。

Abstract: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) remain a major source of preventable harm, and many clinically important mechanisms are still unknown. Existing models either rely on pharmacologic knowledge graphs (KGs), which fail on unseen drugs, or on electronic health records (EHRs), which are noisy, temporal, and site-dependent. We introduce, to our knowledge, the first system that conditions KG relation scoring on patient-level EHR context and distills that reasoning into an EHR-only model for zero-shot inference. A fusion "Teacher" learns mechanism-specific relations for drug pairs represented in both sources, while a distilled "Student" generalizes to new or rarely used drugs without KG access at inference. Both operate under a shared ontology (set) of pharmacologic mechanisms (drug relations) to produce interpretable, auditable alerts rather than opaque risk scores. Trained on a multi-institution EHR corpus paired with a curated DrugBank DDI graph, and evaluated using a clinically aligned, decision-focused protocol with leakage-safe negatives that avoid artificially easy pairs, the system maintains precision across multi-institutuion test data, produces mechanism-specific, clinically consistent predictions, reduces false alerts (higher precision) at comparable overall detection performance (F1), and misses fewer true interactions compared to prior methods. Case studies further show zero-shot identification of clinically recognized CYP-mediated and pharmacodynamic mechanisms for drugs absent from the KG, supporting real-world use in clinical decision support and pharmacovigilance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决阿尔茨海默病预测中的成本-准确性困境：认知测试和临床数据预测能力有限，而PET扫描和CSF生物标志物分析虽然准确但过于昂贵。

Method: 设计两阶段机器学习框架，基于预测的"信息价值"选择性获取昂贵的高级特征，应用于ADNI数据库的MCI患者数据。

Result: 框架将高级检测需求减少20%，测试AUROC达到0.929，与使用全部特征的模型性能相当（AUROC=0.915，p=0.1010），并提供可解释性分析。

Conclusion: 该框架优化了AD诊断路径，在准确性和成本之间取得平衡，为实现早期可靠的AD预测提供了可行方案，未来需要更多类别高级特征和大规模验证。

Abstract: Accurate predictions of conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD) can enable effective personalized therapy. While cognitive tests and clinical data are routinely collected, they lack the predictive power of PET scans and CSF biomarker analysis, which are prohibitively expensive to obtain for every patient. To address this cost-accuracy dilemma, we design a two-stage machine learning framework that selectively obtains advanced, costly features based on their predicted "value of information". We apply our framework to predict AD progression for MCI patients using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our framework reduces the need for advanced testing by 20% while achieving a test AUROC of 0.929, comparable to the model that uses both basic and advanced features (AUROC=0.915, p=0.1010). We also provide an example interpretability analysis showing how one may explain the triage decision. Our work presents an interpretable, data-driven framework that optimizes AD diagnostic pathways and balances accuracy with cost, representing a step towards making early, reliable AD prediction more accessible in real-world practice. Future work should consider multiple categories of advanced features and larger-scale validation.

Abstract: Multi-modal learning (MML) aims to integrate information from multiple modalities, which is expected to lead to superior performance over single-modality learning. However, recent studies have shown that MML can underperform, even compared to single-modality approaches, due to imbalanced learning across modalities. Methods have been proposed to alleviate this imbalance issue using different heuristics, which often lead to computationally intensive subroutines. In this paper, we reformulate the MML problem as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem that overcomes the imbalanced learning issue among modalities and propose a gradient-based algorithm to solve the modified MML problem. We provide convergence guarantees for the proposed method, and empirical evaluations on popular MML benchmarks showcasing the improved performance of the proposed method over existing balanced MML and MOO baselines, with up to ~20x reduction in subroutine computation time. Our code is available at https://github.com/heshandevaka/MIMO.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度模型在分子性质预测中往往难以解释，可能依赖虚假背景而非因果结构，导致在分布偏移下可靠性降低和预测性能下降。

Method: 在每一层使用因果块进行软分割，将输入分为因果和非因果分支，跨模态融合因果证据，逐步移除批次耦合的背景信息以聚焦于标签相关结构，限制捷径信号并稳定逐层精炼。

Result: 在四个分子基准测试中，CLaP在MAE、MSE和R²指标上持续优于竞争基线方法，并生成原子级因果显著性图谱，为靶向分子编辑提供可操作指导。

Conclusion: 通过在每一层剥离背景与因果，该模型产生了既准确又可解释的分子设计预测器，案例研究证实了图谱的准确性及其与化学直觉的一致性。

Abstract: Deep models are used for molecular property prediction, yet they are often difficult to interpret and may rely on spurious context rather than causal structure, which reduces reliability under distribution shift and harms predictive performance. We introduce CLaP (Causal Layerwise Peeling), a framework that separates causal signal from context in a layerwise manner and integrates diverse graph representations of molecules. At each layer, a causal block performs a soft split into causal and non-causal branches, fuses causal evidence across modalities, and progressively removes batch-coupled context to focus on label-relevant structure, thereby limiting shortcut signals and stabilizing layerwise refinement. Across four molecular benchmarks, CLaP consistently improves MAE, MSE, and $R^2$ over competitive baselines. The model also produces atom-level causal saliency maps that highlight substructures responsible for predictions, providing actionable guidance for targeted molecular edits. Case studies confirm the accuracy of these maps and their alignment with chemical intuition. By peeling context from cause at every layer, the model yields predictors that are both accurate and interpretable for molecular design.

TL;DR: ML-EcoLyzer是一个跨框架工具，用于测量机器学习推理在CPU、消费级GPU和数据中心加速器上的碳、能源、热力和水资源成本，并引入环境可持续性评分(ESS)来量化每克CO₂排放所服务的有效参数数量。

Motivation: 机器学习推理规模巨大，但其环境影响在低资源硬件上仍未得到充分量化，需要系统性的工具来评估和优化环境可持续性。

Method: 开发ML-EcoLyzer工具，支持经典和现代模型，应用自适应监测和硬件感知评估，在1,900多个推理配置上进行测试，涵盖不同模型架构、任务模态、硬件类型和精度级别。

Result: 量化结果表明：量化技术可提高ESS，大型加速器在轻量级应用中可能效率低下，即使是小型模型在次优实现时也可能产生显著成本。

Conclusion: ML-EcoLyzer为可持续性意识模型选择设定了标准，并提供了推理期间环境成本的广泛实证评估。

Abstract: Machine learning inference occurs at a massive scale, yet its environmental impact remains poorly quantified, especially on low-resource hardware. We present ML-EcoLyzer, a cross-framework tool for measuring the carbon, energy, thermal, and water costs of inference across CPUs, consumer GPUs, and datacenter accelerators. The tool supports both classical and modern models, applying adaptive monitoring and hardware-aware evaluation.
  We introduce the Environmental Sustainability Score (ESS), which quantifies the number of effective parameters served per gram of CO$_2$ emitted. Our evaluation covers over 1,900 inference configurations, spanning diverse model architectures, task modalities (text, vision, audio, tabular), hardware types, and precision levels. These rigorous and reliable measurements demonstrate that quantization enhances ESS, huge accelerators can be inefficient for lightweight applications, and even small models may incur significant costs when implemented suboptimally. ML-EcoLyzer sets a standard for sustainability-conscious model selection and offers an extensive empirical evaluation of environmental costs during inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的参数高效微调方法（如Adapters和LoRA）通常会破坏对称性，不适用于等变图神经网络。ELoRA虽然解决了等变性问题，但其较高的自由度仍会扰动预训练特征分布并影响性能

Method: MMEA采用轻量级标量门控，在每阶和每多重性基础上调制特征幅度，保持严格等变性

Result: 在多个基准测试中，MMEA持续改进能量和力预测至最先进水平，同时训练的参数少于竞争方法

Conclusion: 在许多实际场景中，调制通道幅度足以使等变模型适应新的化学环境而不破坏对称性，这为等变PEFT设计指明了新方向

Abstract: Pretrained equivariant graph neural networks based on spherical harmonics offer efficient and accurate alternatives to computationally expensive ab-initio methods, yet adapting them to new tasks and chemical environments still requires fine-tuning. Conventional parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, such as Adapters and LoRA, typically break symmetry, making them incompatible with those equivariant architectures. ELoRA, recently proposed, is the first equivariant PEFT method. It achieves improved parameter efficiency and performance on many benchmarks. However, the relatively high degrees of freedom it retains within each tensor order can still perturb pretrained feature distributions and ultimately degrade performance. To address this, we present Magnitude-Modulated Equivariant Adapter (MMEA), a novel equivariant fine-tuning method which employs lightweight scalar gating to modulate feature magnitudes on a per-order and per-multiplicity basis. We demonstrate that MMEA preserves strict equivariance and, across multiple benchmarks, consistently improves energy and force predictions to state-of-the-art levels while training fewer parameters than competing approaches. These results suggest that, in many practical scenarios, modulating channel magnitudes is sufficient to adapt equivariant models to new chemical environments without breaking symmetry, pointing toward a new paradigm for equivariant PEFT design.

Motivation: 现有设备端传感器校准研究仅关注三个宏观需求（精度、实时性、资源效率），但隐藏了瞬时误差和最坏情况延迟等部署瓶颈问题。

Method: SCARE包含三个核心组件：1）序列透镜投影器对数压缩时间序列数据；2）高效位元注意力模块用位运算替代乘法；3）哈希优化策略确保稳定训练。

Result: 在大规模空气质量数据集和真实微控制器部署上的实验表明，SCARE优于现有的线性、混合和深度学习基线方法。

Conclusion: SCARE是首个同时满足所有八个微观需求的传感器校准模型，实现了精度、实时性和效率的平衡。

Abstract: Most on-device sensor calibration studies benchmark models only against three macroscopic requirements (i.e., accuracy, real-time, and resource efficiency), thereby hiding deployment bottlenecks such as instantaneous error and worst-case latency. We therefore decompose this triad into eight microscopic requirements and introduce Scare (Sensor Calibration model balancing Accuracy, Real-time, and Efficiency), an ultra-compressed transformer that fulfills them all. SCARE comprises three core components: (1) Sequence Lens Projector (SLP) that logarithmically compresses time-series data while preserving boundary information across bins, (2) Efficient Bitwise Attention (EBA) module that replaces costly multiplications with bitwise operations via binary hash codes, and (3) Hash optimization strategy that ensures stable training without auxiliary loss terms. Together, these components minimize computational overhead while maintaining high accuracy and compatibility with microcontroller units (MCUs). Extensive experiments on large-scale air-quality datasets and real microcontroller deployments demonstrate that Scare outperforms existing linear, hybrid, and deep-learning baselines, making Scare, to the best of our knowledge, the first model to meet all eight microscopic requirements simultaneously.

Conclusion: 所提出的多模态持续学习框架能有效整合多模态信息并防止灾难性遗忘，在多种学习场景下表现出色。

Abstract: Continual learning is essential for adapting models to new tasks while retaining previously acquired knowledge. While existing approaches predominantly focus on uni-modal data, multi-modal learning offers substantial benefits by utilizing diverse sensory inputs, akin to human perception. However, multi-modal continual learning presents additional challenges, as the model must effectively integrate new information from various modalities while preventing catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we propose a pre-trained model-based framework for multi-modal continual learning. Our framework includes a novel cross-modality adapter with a mixture-of-experts structure to facilitate effective integration of multi-modal information across tasks. We also introduce a representation alignment loss that fosters learning of robust multi-modal representations, and regularize relationships between learned representations to preserve knowledge from previous tasks. Experiments on several multi-modal datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms baselines in both class-incremental and domain-incremental learning, achieving higher accuracy and reduced forgetting.

Conclusion: 推理性能主要源于基础模型参数的微小改变，参数高效训练方法可作为揭示语言模型行为动态的有力工具。

Abstract: Reasoning models leverage inference-time compute to significantly enhance the performance of language models on difficult logical tasks, and have become a dominating paradigm in frontier LLMs. Despite their wide adoption, the mechanisms underpinning the enhanced performance of these reasoning models are not well understood. In this work, we show that the majority of new capabilities in reasoning models can be elicited by small, single-rank changes to base model parameters, with many of these changes being interpretable. Specifically, we use a rank-1 LoRA to create a minimal parameter adapter for Qwen-2.5-32B-Instruct which recovers 73-90% of reasoning-benchmark performance compared to a full parameter finetune. We find that the activations of this LoRA are as interpretable as MLP neurons, and fire for reasoning-specific behaviors. Finally, we train a sparse autoencoder on the entire activation state of this LoRA and identify fine-grained and monosemantic features. Our findings highlight that reasoning performance can arise largely from minimal changes to base model parameters, and explore what these changes affect. More broadly, our work shows that parameter-efficient training methods can be used as a targeted lens for uncovering fundamental insights about language model behavior and dynamics.

Motivation: 现有方法如残差连接和跳跃层只能部分缓解过平滑问题，未能显式建模节点表示在层间的节点特定渐进演化，且未考虑全局信息。

Method: DMbaGCN包含两个模块：LSEMba用于局部邻域聚合，利用Mamba的选择性状态空间建模捕获节点特定表示动态；GCAMba利用Mamba的全局注意力能力为每个节点融入全局上下文。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验证明了该方法的有效性和效率。

Conclusion: DMbaGCN通过结合局部状态演化和全局上下文感知，增强了深度GNN中节点的可区分性，从而有效缓解了过平滑问题。

Abstract: Over-smoothing remains a fundamental challenge in deep Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), where repeated message passing causes node representations to become indistinguishable. While existing solutions, such as residual connections and skip layers, alleviate this issue to some extent, they fail to explicitly model how node representations evolve in a node-specific and progressive manner across layers. Moreover, these methods do not take global information into account, which is also crucial for mitigating the over-smoothing problem. To address the aforementioned issues, in this work, we propose a Dual Mamba-enhanced Graph Convolutional Network (DMbaGCN), which is a novel framework that integrates Mamba into GNNs to address over-smoothing from both local and global perspectives. DMbaGCN consists of two modules: the Local State-Evolution Mamba (LSEMba) for local neighborhood aggregation and utilizing Mamba's selective state space modeling to capture node-specific representation dynamics across layers, and the Global Context-Aware Mamba (GCAMba) that leverages Mamba's global attention capabilities to incorporate global context for each node. By combining these components, DMbaGCN enhances node discriminability in deep GNNs, thereby mitigating over-smoothing. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.

Conclusion: IFed-ICL能够利用本地私有领域数据实现高效的分布式上下文学习，显著提升模型在特定任务上的性能。

Abstract: As large language models continue to develop and expand, the extensive public data they rely on faces the risk of depletion. Consequently, leveraging private data within organizations to enhance the performance of large models has emerged as a key challenge. The federated learning paradigm, combined with model fine-tuning techniques, effectively reduces the number of trainable parameters. However,the necessity to process high-dimensional feature spaces results in substantial overall computational overhead. To address this issue, we propose the Implicit Federated In-Context Learning (IFed-ICL) framework. IFed-ICL draws inspiration from federated learning to establish a novel distributed collaborative paradigm, by converting client local context examples into implicit vector representations, it enables distributed collaborative computation during the inference phase and injects model residual streams to enhance model performance. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves outstanding performance across multiple text classification tasks. Compared to traditional methods, IFed-ICL avoids the extensive parameter updates required by conventional fine-tuning methods while reducing data transmission and local computation at the client level in federated learning. This enables efficient distributed context learning using local private-domain data, significantly improving model performance on specific tasks.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have revolutionized computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) by achieving state-of-the-art performance across a range of benchmarks. However, nonlinear operations in models significantly contribute to inference latency, presenting unique challenges for efficient hardware acceleration. To this end, we propose QUARK, a quantization-enabled FPGA acceleration framework that leverages common patterns in nonlinear operations to enable efficient circuit sharing, thereby reducing hardware resource requirements. QUARK targets all nonlinear operations within Transformer-based models, achieving high-performance approximation through a novel circuit-sharing design tailored to accelerate these operations. Our evaluation demonstrates that QUARK significantly reduces the computational overhead of nonlinear operators in mainstream Transformer architectures, achieving up to a 1.96 times end-to-end speedup over GPU implementations. Moreover, QUARK lowers the hardware overhead of nonlinear modules by more than 50% compared to prior approaches, all while maintaining high model accuracy -- and even substantially boosting accuracy under ultra-low-bit quantization.

TL;DR: 提出了数据轨迹对齐（DTA）框架，通过两阶段数据管理方法，将解决过程（不仅是最终答案）作为首要监督信号，在电信数学领域实现最先进性能，同时显著提升边缘推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用大语言模型在垂直领域（如电信）部署面临挑战：语料稀缺、信息密度低，以及移动/边缘设备计算资源受限。需要一种既能适应领域知识又能满足效率要求的解决方案。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段（初始化）使用强教师模型合成多样化候选解；第二阶段（DTA）重写教师解决方案，对齐中间步骤和呈现风格，并通过一致性检查和基于反思的评判进行信号感知的示例选择。

Result: 在TELEMATH数据集上达到72.45%的pass@1准确率，比仅蒸馏训练提升17.65个百分点，比启用思维模式的Qwen3-32B基线提升2.94个百分点。边缘推理效率显著提升：能耗降低约42%，端到端延迟降低约60%。

Conclusion: 对齐解决方案生成过程能够为紧凑、高收益的监督提供有效方法，在准确性和效率方面均有优势，为低资源垂直领域的领域适应提供了实用方案。

Abstract: General-purpose large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in verticals such as telecommunications, where adaptation is hindered by scarce, low-information-density corpora and tight mobile/edge constraints. We propose Data Trajectory Alignment (DTA), a two-phase, model-agnostic data curation framework that treats solution processes - not only final answers - as first-class supervision. Phase I (Initializing) synthesizes diverse, high-coverage candidates using an ensemble of strong teachers. Phase II (DTA) rewrites teacher solutions to align intermediate steps and presentation style with the target student's inductive biases and then performs signal-aware exemplar selection via agreement checks and reflection-based judging. Instantiated on telecommunications mathematics (e.g., link budgets, SNR/AMC selection, and power-control feasibility), DTA yields state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy on TELEMATH without enabling explicit "thinking" modes: 72.45% pass@1, surpassing distilled-only training by +17.65 points and outperforming a strong baseline (Qwen3-32B with thinking enabled) by +2.94 points. Token-shift analyses indicate that DTA concentrates gains on logical-structural discourse markers rather than merely amplifying domain nouns, indicating improved reasoning scaffolding. Under edge-like inference settings, DTA improves efficiency by reducing reliance on multi-sample voting and disabling expensive reasoning heuristics, cutting energy per output token by ~42% versus Qwen3-32B (thinking mode enabled) and end-to-end latency by ~60% versus Qwen3-32B (thinking mode disabled). These results demonstrate that aligning how solutions are produced enables compact, high-yield supervision that is effective for both accuracy and efficiency, offering a practical recipe for domain adaptation in low-resource verticals beyond telecom.

Motivation: 尽管VAE在推荐系统中表现优异，但其协作机制的理论基础仍不明确，特别是输入掩码技术的作用机制缺乏深入分析。

Method: 通过推导潜在共享半径分析协作机制，比较β-KL正则化和输入掩码两种全局混合机制，提出锚定正则化器来稳定用户表示。

Result: 在Netflix、MovieLens-20M和Million Song数据集上验证了分析结果，并在亚马逊流媒体平台上成功部署。

Conclusion: VAE推荐系统主要依赖局部协作，通过适当的正则化技术可以平衡局部和全局协作，提高推荐性能。

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are a powerful alternative to matrix factorization for recommendation. A common technique in VAE-based collaborative filtering (CF) consists in applying binary input masking to user interaction vectors, which improves performance but remains underexplored theoretically. In this work, we analyze how collaboration arises in VAE-based CF and show it is governed by latent proximity: we derive a latent sharing radius that informs when an SGD update on one user strictly reduces the loss on another user, with influence decaying as the latent Wasserstein distance increases. We further study the induced geometry: with clean inputs, VAE-based CF primarily exploits \emph{local} collaboration between input-similar users and under-utilizes global collaboration between far-but-related users. We compare two mechanisms that encourage \emph{global} mixing and characterize their trade-offs: (1) $β$-KL regularization directly tightens the information bottleneck, promoting posterior overlap but risking representational collapse if too large; (2) input masking induces stochastic geometric contractions and expansions, which can bring distant users onto the same latent neighborhood but also introduce neighborhood drift. To preserve user identity while enabling global consistency, we propose an anchor regularizer that aligns user posteriors with item embeddings, stabilizing users under masking and facilitating signal sharing across related items. Our analyses are validated on the Netflix, MovieLens-20M, and Million Song datasets. We also successfully deployed our proposed algorithm on an Amazon streaming platform following a successful online experiment.

Conclusion: MASS框架在真实世界低资源睡眠监测环境中具有高效和可扩展部署的潜力。

Abstract: Automatic sleep staging plays a vital role in assessing sleep quality and diagnosing sleep disorders. Most existing methods rely heavily on long and continuous EEG recordings, which poses significant challenges for data acquisition in resource-constrained systems, such as wearable or home-based monitoring systems. In this paper, we propose the task of resource-efficient sleep staging, which aims to reduce the amount of signal collected per sleep epoch while maintaining reliable classification performance. To solve this task, we adopt the masking and prompt learning strategy and propose a novel framework called Mask-Aware Sleep Staging (MASS). Specifically, we design a multi-level masking strategy to promote effective feature modeling under partial and irregular observations. To mitigate the loss of contextual information introduced by masking, we further propose a hierarchical prompt learning mechanism that aggregates unmasked data into a global prompt, serving as a semantic anchor for guiding both patch-level and epoch-level feature modeling. MASS is evaluated on four datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance, especially when the amount of data is very limited. This result highlights its potential for efficient and scalable deployment in real-world low-resource sleep monitoring environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代深度模型参数量巨大导致推理时内存占用高，现有参数共享方法局限于相邻层且缺乏系统性分析，跨层共享的配置空间呈指数级增长，难以进行穷举搜索。

Method: 将参数共享视为参数空间的结构对称性引入，提出基于泰勒展开和Hessian谱的二阶几何准则，通过将扰动投影到Hessian的低曲率特征子空间来最小化性能影响。

Result: 在多种架构和任务上，Geo-Sharing始终优于最先进的启发式共享策略，实现更高的压缩比和更小的精度下降。

Conclusion: 从群论视角重新构建参数共享问题，提出的几何准则提供了原则性和可扩展的配置方法，有效解决了跨层共享的配置瓶颈。

Abstract: Modern deep models have massive parameter sizes, leading to high inference-time memory usage that limits practical deployment. Parameter sharing, a form of structured compression, effectively reduces redundancy, but existing approaches remain heuristic-restricted to adjacent layers and lacking a systematic analysis for cross-layer sharing. However, extending sharing across multiple layers leads to an exponentially expanding configuration space, making exhaustive search computationally infeasible and forming a critical bottleneck for parameter sharing. We recast parameter sharing from a group-theoretic perspective as introducing structural symmetries in the model's parameter space. A sharing configuration can be described by a coloring function $α:L\rightarrow C$ (L: layer indices and C: sharing classes), which determines inter-layer sharing groups while preserving structural symmetry. To determine the coloring function, we propose a second-order geometric criterion based on Taylor expansion and the Hessian spectrum. By projecting perturbations onto the Hessian's low-curvature eigensubspace, the criterion provides an analytic rule for selecting sharing groups that minimize performance impact, yielding a principled and scalable configuration procedure. Across diverse architectures and tasks, Geo-Sharing consistently outperforms state-of-the-art heuristic sharing strategies, achieving higher compression ratios with smaller accuracy degradation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的因果发现方法通常假设完美先验知识或只能处理特定类型的错误，当面对位置和类型未知的缺陷约束时性能显著下降。

Method: 首先通过代理模型评估不完美结构约束的可信度，指导稀疏惩罚项；然后引入多任务学习框架，通过多梯度下降联合优化数据驱动和知识驱动的目标。

Result: 该方法在线性和非线性设置下都具有鲁棒性，在多种噪声条件和结构方程模型类型下的广泛实验证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够有效处理不完美的结构约束，在因果发现任务中实现了知识和数据的协调统一。

Abstract: Robust causal discovery from observational data under imperfect prior knowledge remains a significant and largely unresolved challenge. Existing methods typically presuppose perfect priors or can only handle specific, pre-identified error types. And their performance degrades substantially when confronted with flawed constraints of unknown location and type. This decline arises because most of them rely on inflexible and biased thresholding strategies that may conflict with the data distribution. To overcome these limitations, we propose to harmonizes knowledge and data through prior alignment and conflict resolution. First, we assess the credibility of imperfect structural constraints through a surrogate model, which then guides a sparse penalization term measuring the loss between the learned and constrained adjacency matrices. We theoretically prove that, under ideal assumption, the knowledge-driven objective aligns with the data-driven objective. Furthermore, to resolve conflicts when this assumption is violated, we introduce a multi-task learning framework optimized via multi-gradient descent, jointly minimizing both objectives. Our proposed method is robust to both linear and nonlinear settings. Extensive experiments, conducted under diverse noise conditions and structural equation model types, demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method under imperfect structural constraints.

Abstract: Transitioning to sustainable and resilient energy systems requires navigating complex and interdependent trade-offs across environmental, social, and resource dimensions. Neglecting these trade-offs can lead to unintended consequences across sectors. However, existing assessments often evaluate emerging energy pathways and their impacts in silos, overlooking critical interactions such as regional resource competition and cumulative impacts. We present an integrated modeling framework that couples agent-based modeling and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to simulate how energy transition pathways interact with regional resource competition, ecological constraints, and community-level burdens. We apply the model to a case study in Southern California. The results demonstrate how integrated and multiscale decision making can shape energy pathway deployment and reveal spatially explicit trade-offs under scenario-driven constraints. This modeling framework can further support more adaptive and resilient energy transition planning on spatial and institutional scales.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) extend foundation models to real-world applications by integrating inputs such as text and vision. However, their broad knowledge capacity raises growing concerns about privacy leakage, toxicity mitigation, and intellectual property violations. Machine Unlearning (MU) offers a practical solution by selectively forgetting targeted knowledge while preserving overall model utility. When applied to MLLMs, existing neuron-editing-based MU approaches face two fundamental challenges: (1) forgetting becomes inconsistent across modalities because existing point-wise attribution methods fail to capture the structured, layer-by-layer information flow that connects different modalities; and (2) general knowledge performance declines when sensitive neurons that also support important reasoning paths are pruned, as this disrupts the model's ability to generalize. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a multimodal influential neuron path editor (MIP-Editor) for MU. Our approach introduces modality-specific attribution scores to identify influential neuron paths responsible for encoding forget-set knowledge and applies influential-path-aware neuron-editing via representation misdirection. This strategy also enables effective and coordinated forgetting across modalities while preserving the model's general capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that MIP-Editor achieves a superior unlearning performance on multimodal tasks, with a maximum forgetting rate of 87.75% and up to 54.26% improvement in general knowledge retention. On textual tasks, MIP-Editor achieves up to 80.65% forgetting and preserves 77.9% of general performance. Codes are available at https://github.com/PreckLi/MIP-Editor.

Motivation: 现有机器遗忘算法忽视了不同数据点对模型性能的贡献差异（数据价值异质性），平等对待所有数据点会导致更新后模型性能下降。

Method: 设计基于数据价值的加权策略，将其整合到遗忘过程中，实现差异化遗忘。以一步牛顿更新为例，开发了输出扰动和目标扰动算法，并展示了在梯度上升方法中的扩展性。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，相比传统遗忘方法，DVWU在预测性能和鲁棒性方面表现更优，且框架具有良好的适应性。

Conclusion: DVWU框架成功将数据价值异质性纳入机器遗忘过程，为更广泛的基于梯度的深度遗忘方法提供了适应性解决方案。

Abstract: As the right to be forgotten becomes legislated worldwide, machine unlearning mechanisms have emerged to efficiently update models for data deletion and enhance user privacy protection. However, existing machine unlearning algorithms frequently neglect the fact that different data points may contribute unequally to model performance (i.e., heterogeneous data values). Treat them equally in machine unlearning procedure can potentially degrading the performance of updated models. To address this limitation, we propose Data Value-Weighted Unlearning (DVWU), a general unlearning framework that accounts for data value heterogeneity into the unlearning process. Specifically, we design a weighting strategy based on data values, which are then integrated into the unlearning procedure to enable differentiated unlearning for data points with varying utility to the model. The DVWU framework can be broadly adapted to various existing machine unlearning methods. We use the one-step Newton update as an example for implementation, developing both output and objective perturbation algorithms to achieve certified unlearning. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods achieve superior predictive performance and robustness compared to conventional unlearning approaches. We further show the extensibility of our framework on gradient ascent method by incorporating the proposed weighting strategy into the gradient terms, highlighting the adaptability of DVWU for broader gradient-based deep unlearning methods.

Motivation: 传统集中式网络监控方法存在隐私泄露风险，且难以在大规模网络中实现早期风险识别。需要一种既能保护隐私又能准确预测网络负载的方法来支持主动流量工程和容量规划。

Method: 采用联邦学习对节点级流量进行分布式建模，结合已知路由信息聚合源-目的地对的流量贡献来估计链路级利用率，然后根据预测负载强度和时序变异性对链路进行排名。

Conclusion: FedNET是一个实用的工具，能够在不暴露敏感网络数据的情况下，为预期流量工程和容量规划提供早期预警，有效识别即将出现的关键压力状态。

Abstract: We propose FedNET, a proactive and privacy-preserving framework for early identification of high-risk links in large-scale communication networks, that leverages a distributed multi-step traffic forecasting method. FedNET employs Federated Learning (FL) to model the temporal evolution of node-level traffic in a distributed manner, enabling accurate multi-step-ahead predictions (e.g., several hours to days) without exposing sensitive network data. Using these node-level forecasts and known routing information, FedNET estimates the future link-level utilization by aggregating traffic contributions across all source-destination pairs. The links are then ranked according to the predicted load intensity and temporal variability, providing an early warning signal for potential high-risk links. We compare the federated traffic prediction of FedNET against a centralized multi-step learning baseline and then systematically analyze the impact of history and prediction window sizes on forecast accuracy using the $R^2$ score. Results indicate that FL achieves accuracy close to centralized training, with shorter prediction horizons consistently yielding the highest accuracy ($R^2 >0.92$), while longer horizons providing meaningful forecasts ($R^2 \approx 0.45\text{--}0.55$). We further validate the efficacy of the FedNET framework in predicting network utilization on a realistic network topology and demonstrate that it consistently identifies high-risk links well in advance (i.e., three days ahead) of the critical stress states emerging, making it a practical tool for anticipatory traffic engineering and capacity planning.

Motivation: 标准Transformer架构在推理时仅进行前向计算，缺乏内部递归能力。本研究旨在开发一种能够动态重入先前潜在状态到计算流中的机制，实现类似思维的内省处理。

Method: 提出FH-RL架构，整合快速权重关联记忆、稳态正则化和学习重入反馈。通过控制重入增益γ进行实验，使用IRR、ESRI和RDP三个新指标评估内部动态。

Result: 重入量随γ增加而增加，学习反馈矩阵Wr保持有界且在中等增益下更结构化。在γ≈0.10-0.20处出现稳定反射带，内部反馈表达性最强且频谱稳定。

Conclusion: 反馈放大和稳态调节的平衡可以产生类似思维的反射性内部处理，将现代快速权重架构与皮层重入和递归认知理论联系起来。

Abstract: This study introduces the Fast-Weights Homeostatic Reentry Layer (FH-RL), a neural mechanism that integrates fast-weight associative memory, homeostatic regularization, and learned reentrant feedback to approximate self-referential computation in neural networks. Unlike standard transformer architectures that operate in a purely feedforward manner during inference, FH-RL enables internal recurrence without external looping, allowing prior latent states to be dynamically re-entered into the ongoing computation stream. We conduct controlled experiments sweeping the reentry gain $γ$ and evaluate emergent internal dynamics using three novel metrics: the Information Reentry Ratio (IRR), Eigen-Spectrum Recursion Index (ESRI), and Representational Drift Periodicity (RDP). Results show that reentry quantity increases proportionally with~$γ$, while the learned feedback matrix $W_r$ remains bounded and becomes more structured at moderate gains. Critically, a stable reflective band emerges around $γ\approx 0.10-0.20$, where internal feedback is maximally expressive yet spectrally stable: IRR rises smoothly, ESRI remains near zero, and RDP exhibits consistent low-frequency cycles. These findings provide quantitative evidence that reflective, thought-like internal processing can arise from a principled balance between feedback amplification and homeostatic regulation, linking modern fast-weight architectures to theories of cortical reentry and recursive cognition.

Conclusion: 神经初始化牛顿策略成功结合了神经算子的效率和NFEM的稳健性，为计算固体力学提供了有效的加速解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a Newton-based scheme, initialized by neural operator predictions, to accelerate the parametric solution of nonlinear problems in computational solid mechanics. First, a physics informed conditional neural field is trained to approximate the nonlinear parametric solutionof the governing equations. This establishes a continuous mapping between the parameter and solution spaces, which can then be evaluated for a given parameter at any spatial resolution. Second, since the neural approximation may not be exact, it is subsequently refined using a Newton-based correction initialized by the neural output. To evaluate the effectiveness of this hybrid approach, we compare three solution strategies: (i) the standard Newton-Raphson solver used in NFEM, which is robust and accurate but computationally demanding; (ii) physics-informed neural operators, which provide rapid inference but may lose accuracy outside the training distribution and resolution; and (iii) the neural-initialized Newton (NiN) strategy, which combines the efficiency of neural operators with the robustness of NFEM. The results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid approach reduces computational cost while preserving accuracy, highlighting its potential to accelerate large-scale nonlinear simulations.

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) typically relies on modeling environment dynamics for data efficiency. However, due to the accumulation of model errors over long-horizon rollouts, such methods often face challenges in maintaining modeling stability. To address this, we propose CtrlFlow, a trajectory-level synthetic method using conditional flow matching (CFM), which directly modeling the distribution of trajectories from initial states to high-return terminal states without explicitly modeling the environment transition function. Our method ensures optimal trajectory sampling by minimizing the control energy governed by the non-linear Controllability Gramian Matrix, while the generated diverse trajectory data significantly enhances the robustness and cross-task generalization of policy learning. In online settings, CtrlFlow demonstrates the better performance on common MuJoCo benchmark tasks than dynamics models and achieves superior sample efficiency compared to standard MBRL methods.

Abstract: Monte Carlo random walk methods are widely used in capacitance extraction for their mesh-free formulation and inherent parallelism. However, modern semiconductor technologies with densely packed structures present significant challenges in unbiasedly sampling transition domains in walk steps with multiple high-contrast dielectric materials. We present DeepRWCap, a machine learning-guided random walk solver that predicts the transition quantities required to guide each step of the walk. These include Poisson kernels, gradient kernels, signs and magnitudes of weights. DeepRWCap employs a two-stage neural architecture that decomposes structured outputs into face-wise distributions and spatial kernels on cube faces. It uses 3D convolutional networks to capture volumetric dielectric interactions and 2D depthwise separable convolutions to model localized kernel behavior. The design incorporates grid-based positional encodings and structural design choices informed by cube symmetries to reduce learning redundancy and improve generalization. Trained on 100,000 procedurally generated dielectric configurations, DeepRWCap achieves a mean relative error of $1.24\pm0.53$\% when benchmarked against the commercial Raphael solver on the self-capacitance estimation of 10 industrial designs spanning 12 to 55 nm nodes. Compared to the state-of-the-art stochastic difference method Microwalk, DeepRWCap achieves an average 23\% speedup. On complex designs with runtimes over 10 s, it reaches an average 49\% acceleration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确定全连接神经网络的最小宽度是深度神经网络理论研究中的基本问题，对于网络设计和训练具有重要意义。

Method: 通过理论分析证明不同激活函数下的最小宽度上下界，并使用Poincaré-Miranda定理构造几何示例来证明下界。

Result: 对于ELU、SELU等激活函数，证明w_min ≤ max(2d_x+1, d_y)；对于LeakyReLU、ELU等激活函数，证明d_x+1 ≤ w_min ≤ d_x+d_y；对于ReLU等注入性激活函数，证明w_min ≥ d_y + 1_{d_x<d_y≤2d_x}。

Conclusion: 该研究为全连接神经网络的宽度设计提供了理论指导，证明了不同激活函数下最小宽度的精确界限，并提出了新的几何证明方法。

Abstract: Determining the minimum width of fully connected neural networks has become a fundamental problem in recent theoretical studies of deep neural networks. In this paper, we study the lower bounds and upper bounds of the minimum width required for fully connected neural networks in order to have universal approximation capability, which is important in network design and training. We show that $w_{min}\leq\max(2d_x+1, d_y)$ for networks with ELU, SELU, and the upper bound of this inequality is attained when $d_y=2d_x$, where $d_x$, $d_y$ denote the input and output dimensions, respectively. Besides, we show that $d_x+1\leq w_{min}\leq d_x+d_y$ for networks with LeakyReLU, ELU, CELU, SELU, Softplus, by proving that ReLU can be approximated by these activation functions. In addition, in the case that the activation function is injective or can be uniformly approximated by a sequence of injective functions (e.g., ReLU), we present a new proof of the inequality $w_{min}\ge d_y+\mathbf{1}_{d_x<d_y\leq2d_x}$ by constructing a more intuitive example via a new geometric approach based on Poincar$\acute{\text{e}}$-Miranda Theorem.

*Lionel Levine,Sajjad Ghiasvand,Haniyeh Ehsani Oskouie,Majid Sarrafzadeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: M2M-DC是一个两尺度、形状安全的压缩框架，通过互信息引导的块剪枝与渐进式内部切片和分阶段知识蒸馏相结合，实现高效的模型压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决深度神经网络模型在部署时的计算和存储开销问题，需要一种既能保持模型精度又能显著减少计算量的压缩方法。

Method: 首先基于标签感知的互信息信号对残差块进行排序并剪除最不重要的单元，然后交替进行短知识蒸馏阶段和残差安全的通道切片，包括阶段平面切片和可选的中通道修剪。

Result: 在CIFAR-100上，ResNet-18达到85.46% Top-1精度，参数减少28%，计算量减少37%；MobileNetV2精度提升2.5个百分点，参数减少73%，计算量减少76%。

Conclusion: M2M-DC提供了一个紧凑实用的压缩方案，能够生成部署就绪的模型，在显著减少计算量的同时保持或超越教师模型的精度。

Abstract: We introduce MI-to-Mid Distilled Compression (M2M-DC), a two-scale, shape-safe compression framework that interleaves information-guided block pruning with progressive inner slicing and staged knowledge distillation (KD). First, M2M-DC ranks residual (or inverted-residual) blocks by a label-aware mutual information (MI) signal and removes the least informative units (structured prune-after-training). It then alternates short KD phases with stage-coherent, residual-safe channel slicing: (i) stage "planes" (co-slicing conv2 out-channels with the downsample path and next-stage inputs), and (ii) an optional mid-channel trim (conv1 out / bn1 / conv2 in). This targets complementary redundancy, whole computational motifs and within-stage width while preserving residual shape invariants. On CIFAR-100, M2M-DC yields a clean accuracy-compute frontier. For ResNet-18, we obtain 85.46% Top-1 with 3.09M parameters and 0.0139 GMacs (72% params, 63% GMacs vs. teacher; mean final 85.29% over three seeds). For ResNet-34, we reach 85.02% Top-1 with 5.46M params and 0.0195 GMacs (74% / 74% vs. teacher; mean final 84.62%). Extending to inverted-residuals, MobileNetV2 achieves a mean final 68.54% Top-1 at 1.71M params (27%) and 0.0186 conv GMacs (24%), improving over the teacher's 66.03% by +2.5 points across three seeds. Because M2M-DC exposes only a thin, architecture-aware interface (blocks, stages, and down sample/skip wiring), it generalizes across residual CNNs and extends to inverted-residual families with minor legalization rules. The result is a compact, practical recipe for deployment-ready models that match or surpass teacher accuracy at a fraction of the compute.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: iTimER是一个用于不规则采样时间序列的自监督预训练框架，通过利用重构误差分布和混合策略生成伪观测值，在分类、插值和预测任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: iTimER通过利用重构误差作为未观测值的代理信号，有效提升了不规则采样时间序列的表示学习性能。

Abstract: Irregularly sampled time series (ISTS), characterized by non-uniform time intervals with natural missingness, are prevalent in real-world applications. Existing approaches for ISTS modeling primarily rely on observed values to impute unobserved ones or infer latent dynamics. However, these methods overlook a critical source of learning signal: the reconstruction error inherently produced during model training. Such error implicitly reflects how well a model captures the underlying data structure and can serve as an informative proxy for unobserved values. To exploit this insight, we propose iTimER, a simple yet effective self-supervised pre-training framework for ISTS representation learning. iTimER models the distribution of reconstruction errors over observed values and generates pseudo-observations for unobserved timestamps through a mixup strategy between sampled errors and the last available observations. This transforms unobserved timestamps into noise-aware training targets, enabling meaningful reconstruction signals. A Wasserstein metric aligns reconstruction error distributions between observed and pseudo-observed regions, while a contrastive learning objective enhances the discriminability of learned representations. Extensive experiments on classification, interpolation, and forecasting tasks demonstrate that iTimER consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods under the ISTS setting.

Conclusion: NCGSB提供了一个更通用的随机过程建模框架，能够捕捉能量变化的复杂现象，CWG方法实现了高效计算和引导生成能力。

Abstract: The Schrödinger Bridge provides a principled framework for modeling stochastic processes between distributions; however, existing methods are limited by energy-conservation assumptions, which constrains the bridge's shape preventing it from model varying-energy phenomena. To overcome this, we introduce the non-conservative generalized Schrödinger bridge (NCGSB), a novel, energy-varying reformulation based on contact Hamiltonian mechanics. By allowing energy to change over time, the NCGSB provides a broader class of real-world stochastic processes, capturing richer and more faithful intermediate dynamics. By parameterizing the Wasserstein manifold, we lift the bridge problem to a tractable geodesic computation in a finite-dimensional space. Unlike computationally expensive iterative solutions, our contact Wasserstein geodesic (CWG) is naturally implemented via a ResNet architecture and relies on a non-iterative solver with near-linear complexity. Furthermore, CWG supports guided generation by modulating a task-specific distance metric. We validate our framework on tasks including manifold navigation, molecular dynamics predictions, and image generation, demonstrating its practical benefits and versatility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统参数高效微调方法依赖单一专家，无法充分捕捉复杂任务中数据的多样性特征，需要开发能够集成多个小适应专家的紧凑结构。

Result: 在自然语言理解、图像分类和数学推理等基准测试中表现出色，为PEFT问题提供了新的有效解决方案。

Conclusion: TuckA方法通过多专家系统和高效路由机制，在保持参数效率的同时显著提升了模型对复杂数据模式的适应能力。

Abstract: Efficiently fine-tuning pre-trained models for downstream tasks is a key challenge in the era of foundation models. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) presents a promising solution, achieving performance comparable to full fine-tuning by updating only a small number of adaptation weights per layer. Traditional PEFT methods typically rely on a single expert, where the adaptation weight is a low-rank matrix. However, for complex tasks, the data's inherent diversity poses a significant challenge for such models, as a single adaptation weight cannot adequately capture the features of all samples. To address this limitation, we explore how to integrate multiple small adaptation experts into a compact structure to defeat a large adapter. Specifically, we propose Tucker Adaptation (TuckA), a method with four key properties: (i) We use Tucker decomposition to create a compact 3D tensor where each slice naturally serves as an expert. The low-rank nature of this decomposition ensures that the number of parameters scales efficiently as more experts are added. (ii) We introduce a hierarchical strategy that organizes these experts into groups at different granularities, allowing the model to capture both local and global data patterns. (iii) We develop an efficient batch-level routing mechanism, which reduces the router's parameter size by a factor of $L$ compared to routing at every adapted layer (where $L$ is the number of adapted layers) (iv) We propose data-aware initialization to achieve loss-free expert load balancing based on theoretical analysis. Extensive experiments on benchmarks in natural language understanding, image classification, and mathematical reasoning speak to the efficacy of TuckA, offering a new and effective solution to the PEFT problem.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeepBooTS是一种新颖的双流残差递减增强方法，通过逐块重建内在信号来提升时间序列预测的鲁棒性，在多个数据集上平均性能提升15.8%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列具有明显的非平稳性，大多数预测方法对概念漂移的鲁棒性较差，尽管普遍应用了实例归一化。

Method: 通过偏差-方差分析概念漂移，提出DeepBooTS：端到端双流残差递减增强方法，每个块成为学习器集合，带有辅助输出分支形成到最终预测的高速通道，逐块输出修正先前块的残差。

Result: 在大规模数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法大幅优于现有方法，在各种数据集上平均性能提升15.8%。

Conclusion: DeepBooTS建立了时间序列预测的新基准，显著提高了对概念漂移的鲁棒性，同时增强了多功能性和可解释性。

Abstract: Time-Series (TS) exhibits pronounced non-stationarity. Consequently, most forecasting methods display compromised robustness to concept drift, despite the prevalent application of instance normalization. We tackle this challenge by first analysing concept drift through a bias-variance lens and proving that weighted ensemble reduces variance without increasing bias. These insights motivate DeepBooTS, a novel end-to-end dual-stream residual-decreasing boosting method that progressively reconstructs the intrinsic signal. In our design, each block of a deep model becomes an ensemble of learners with an auxiliary output branch forming a highway to the final prediction. The block-wise outputs correct the residuals of previous blocks, leading to a learning-driven decomposition of both inputs and targets. This method enhances versatility and interpretability while substantially improving robustness to concept drift. Extensive experiments, including those on large-scale datasets, show that the proposed method outperforms existing methods by a large margin, yielding an average performance improvement of 15.8% across various datasets, establishing a new benchmark for TS forecasting.

*Wenlong Shang,Peng Chang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: COGNOS是一个通用的时间序列异常检测增强框架，通过高斯白噪声正则化和卡尔曼平滑后处理，显著提升重建方法的异常检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于重建的时间序列异常检测方法普遍依赖MSE损失，导致重建残差存在统计缺陷，产生噪声大、不稳定的异常分数，影响检测可靠性。

Method: 提出COGNOS框架：1）训练时引入高斯白噪声正则化，约束模型输出残差符合高斯白噪声分布；2）使用卡尔曼平滑后处理器作为统计最优估计器去噪原始异常分数。

Result: 在多个真实世界基准数据集上，COGNOS应用于12种不同骨干模型，平均F分数提升了57.9%。

Conclusion: 直接正则化输出统计特性是显著改进异常检测系统的强大且可泛化策略。

Abstract: Reconstruction-based methods are a dominant paradigm in time series anomaly detection (TSAD), however, their near-universal reliance on Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss results in statistically flawed reconstruction residuals. This fundamental weakness leads to noisy, unstable anomaly scores with a poor signal-to-noise ratio, hindering reliable detection. To address this, we propose Constrained Gaussian-Noise Optimization and Smoothing (COGNOS), a universal, model-agnostic enhancement framework that tackles this issue at its source. COGNOS introduces a novel Gaussian-White Noise Regularization strategy during training, which directly constrains the model's output residuals to conform to a Gaussian white noise distribution. This engineered statistical property creates the ideal precondition for our second contribution: a Kalman Smoothing Post-processor that provably operates as a statistically optimal estimator to denoise the raw anomaly scores. The synergy between these two components allows COGNOS to robustly separate the true anomaly signal from random fluctuations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that COGNOS is highly effective, delivering an average F-score uplift of 57.9% when applied to 12 diverse backbone models across multiple real-world benchmark datasets. Our work reveals that directly regularizing output statistics is a powerful and generalizable strategy for significantly improving anomaly detection systems.

Motivation: 双重下降现象在非平稳的深度强化学习领域尚未被充分探索，作者旨在系统研究模型容量变化下该现象在DRL中的存在性。

Method: 使用Actor-Critic框架，通过信息论指标策略熵来测量训练过程中的策略不确定性，分析不同模型容量下的表现。

Result: 初步结果显示明显的epoch-wise双重下降曲线，策略进入第二下降区域与策略熵的持续显著减少相关，表明过参数化起到了隐式正则化作用。

Conclusion: 这些发现确立了双重下降在DRL中的存在性，并为设计更通用、可迁移和鲁棒的智能体提供了基于信息的机制。

Abstract: The double descent (DD) paradox, where over-parameterized models see generalization improve past the interpolation point, remains largely unexplored in the non-stationary domain of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). We present preliminary evidence that DD exists in model-free DRL, investigating it systematically across varying model capacity using the Actor-Critic framework. We rely on an information-theoretic metric, Policy Entropy, to measure policy uncertainty throughout training. Preliminary results show a clear epoch-wise DD curve; the policy's entrance into the second descent region correlates with a sustained, significant reduction in Policy Entropy. This entropic decay suggests that over-parameterization acts as an implicit regularizer, guiding the policy towards robust, flatter minima in the loss landscape. These findings establish DD as a factor in DRL and provide an information-based mechanism for designing agents that are more general, transferable, and robust.

Abstract: Accurate day-ahead electricity price forecasting (DAEPF) is critical for the efficient operation of power systems, but extreme condition and market anomalies pose significant challenges to existing forecasting methods. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a novel hybrid deep learning framework that integrates a Distilled Attention Transformer (DAT) model and an Autoencoder Self-regression Model (ASM). The DAT leverages a self-attention mechanism to dynamically assign higher weights to critical segments of historical data, effectively capturing both long-term trends and short-term fluctuations. Concurrently, the ASM employs unsupervised learning to detect and isolate anomalous patterns induced by extreme conditions, such as heavy rain, heat waves, or human festivals. Experiments on datasets sampled from California and Shandong Province demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. Our framework thus holds promise for enhancing grid resilience and optimizing market operations in future power systems.

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验证明了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过考虑ANN和SNN的架构差异，提出的SAMD和NLD知识蒸馏策略显著提高了SNN的训练效果。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) become popular due to excellent energy efficiency, yet facing challenges for effective model training. Recent works improve this by introducing knowledge distillation (KD) techniques, with the pre-trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) used as teachers and the target SNNs as students. This is commonly accomplished through a straightforward element-wise alignment of intermediate features and prediction logits from ANNs and SNNs, often neglecting the intrinsic differences between their architectures. Specifically, ANN's outputs exhibit a continuous distribution, whereas SNN's outputs are characterized by sparsity and discreteness. To mitigate this issue, we introduce two innovative KD strategies. Firstly, we propose the Saliency-scaled Activation Map Distillation (SAMD), which aligns the spike activation map of the student SNN with the class-aware activation map of the teacher ANN. Rather than performing KD directly on the raw %and distinct features of ANN and SNN, our SAMD directs the student to learn from saliency activation maps that exhibit greater semantic and distribution consistency. Additionally, we propose a Noise-smoothed Logits Distillation (NLD), which utilizes Gaussian noise to smooth the sparse logits of student SNN, facilitating the alignment with continuous logits from teacher ANN. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods. Code is available~\footnote{https://github.com/SinoLeu/CKDSNN.git}.

Abstract: Currently, machine learning is widely used across various domains, including time series data analysis. However, some machine learning models function as black boxes, making interpretability a critical concern. One approach to address this issue is counterfactual explanation (CE), which aims to provide insights into model predictions. This study focuses on the relatively underexplored problem of generating counterfactual explanations for time series forecasting. We propose a method for extracting CEs in time series forecasting using exogenous variables, which are frequently encountered in fields such as business and marketing. In addition, we present methods for analyzing the influence of each variable over an entire time series, generating CEs by altering only specific variables, and evaluating the quality of the resulting CEs. We validate the proposed method through theoretical analysis and empirical experiments, showcasing its accuracy and practical applicability. These contributions are expected to support real-world decision-making based on time series data analysis.

Abstract: In the training of large deep neural networks, there is a need for vast amounts of training data. To meet this need, data is collected from multiple domains, such as Wikipedia and GitHub. These domains are heterogeneous in both data quality and the diversity of information they provide. This raises the question of how much we should rely on each domain. Several methods have attempted to address this issue by assigning sampling weights to each data domain using heuristics or approximations. As a first step toward a deeper understanding of the role of data mixing, this work revisits the problem by studying two kinds of weights: sampling weights, which control how much each domain contributes in a batch, and loss weights, which scale the loss from each domain during training. Through a rigorous study of linear regression, we show that these two weights play complementary roles. First, they can reduce the variance of gradient estimates in iterative methods such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Second, they can improve generalization performance by reducing the generalization gap. We provide both theoretical and empirical support for these claims. We further study the joint dynamics of sampling weights and loss weights, examining how they can be combined to capture both contributions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准自注意力在RL环境中效率低下，因为它均匀分配权重给所有历史标记，而RL轨迹是稀疏且奖励驱动的，只有少数关键转换对控制很重要。

Method: 在动态头部的自注意力机制中引入两种结构化归纳先验：(i) 每头记忆长度先验，限制注意力到任务特定窗口；(ii) 分布先验，学习对过去状态-动作对的平滑高斯加权。

Result: 在Atari 100k基准测试中，高斯先验实现了77%的相对改进，而记忆长度先验往往因限制性截断而损失有用信号。

Conclusion: 在部分可观测RL领域，平滑分布先验比离散记忆窗口更灵活适应不同时间范围，能更稳健地提高数据效率。

Abstract: Transformers have shown strong ability to model long-term dependencies and are increasingly adopted as world models in model-based reinforcement learning (RL) under partial observability. However, unlike natural language corpora, RL trajectories are sparse and reward-driven, making standard self-attention inefficient because it distributes weight uniformly across all past tokens rather than emphasizing the few transitions critical for control. To address this, we introduce structured inductive priors into the self-attention mechanism of the dynamics head: (i) per-head memory-length priors that constrain attention to task-specific windows, and (ii) distributional priors that learn smooth Gaussian weightings over past state-action pairs. We integrate these mechanisms into UniZero, a model-based RL agent with a Transformer-based world model that supports planning under partial observability. Experiments on the Atari 100k benchmark show that most efficiency gains arise from the Gaussian prior, which smoothly allocates attention to informative transitions, while memory-length priors often truncate useful signals with overly restrictive cut-offs. In particular, Gaussian Attention achieves a 77% relative improvement in mean human-normalized scores over UniZero. These findings suggest that in partially observable RL domains with non-stationary temporal dependencies, discrete memory windows are difficult to learn reliably, whereas smooth distributional priors flexibly adapt across horizons and yield more robust data efficiency. Overall, our results demonstrate that encoding structured temporal priors directly into self-attention improves the prioritization of informative histories for dynamics modeling under partial observability.

Abstract: Deep neural networks often under-perform on tabular data due to their sensitivity to irrelevant features and a spectral bias toward smooth, low-frequency functions. These limitations hinder their ability to capture the sharp, high-frequency signals that often define tabular structure, especially under limited labeled samples. While self-supervised learning (SSL) offers promise in such settings, it remains challenging in tabular domains due to the lack of effective data augmentations. We propose a hybrid autoencoder that combines a neural encoder with an oblivious soft decision tree (OSDT) encoder, each guided by its own stochastic gating network that performs sample-specific feature selection. Together, these structurally different encoders and model-specific gating networks implement model-based augmentation, producing complementary input views tailored to each architecture. The two encoders, trained with a shared decoder and cross-reconstruction loss, learn distinct yet aligned representations that reflect their respective inductive biases. During training, the OSDT encoder (robust to noise and effective at modeling localized, high-frequency structure) guides the neural encoder toward representations more aligned with tabular data. At inference, only the neural encoder is used, preserving flexibility and SSL compatibility. Spectral analysis highlights the distinct inductive biases of each encoder. Our method achieves consistent gains in low-label classification and regression across diverse tabular datasets, outperforming deep and tree-based supervised baselines.

Motivation: 传统方法无法有效识别电子表格的结构相似性，特别是不能捕捉定义模板的空间布局和类型模式。

Method: 将电子表格转换为单元格级嵌入，然后使用Chamfer和Hausdorff距离等聚合技术计算相似性。

Result: 在FUSTE数据集上实现了完美的模板重构（调整兰德指数1.00 vs 0.90），相比基于图的Mondrian基线表现出更优越的无监督聚类性能。

Conclusion: 该方法支持大规模自动化模板发现，为表格集合的检索增强生成、模型训练和批量数据清理等下游应用提供了基础。

Abstract: Traditional methods for identifying structurally similar spreadsheets fail to capture the spatial layouts and type patterns defining templates. To quantify spreadsheet similarity, we introduce a hybrid distance metric that combines semantic embeddings, data type information, and spatial positioning. In order to calculate spreadsheet similarity, our method converts spreadsheets into cell-level embeddings and then uses aggregation techniques like Chamfer and Hausdorff distances. Experiments across template families demonstrate superior unsupervised clustering performance compared to the graph-based Mondrian baseline, achieving perfect template reconstruction (Adjusted Rand Index of 1.00 versus 0.90) on the FUSTE dataset. Our approach facilitates large-scale automated template discovery, which in turn enables downstream applications such as retrieval-augmented generation over tabular collections, model training, and bulk data cleaning.

Abstract: Efficiently and accurately determining the symmetry is a crucial step in the structural analysis of crystalline materials. Existing methods usually mindlessly apply deep learning models while ignoring the underlying chemical rules. More importantly, experiments show that they face a serious sub-property confusion SPC problem. To address the above challenges, from a decoupled perspective, we introduce the XRDecoupler framework, a problem-solving arsenal specifically designed to tackle the SPC problem. Imitating the thinking process of chemists, we innovatively incorporate multidimensional crystal symmetry information as superclass guidance to ensure that the model's prediction process aligns with chemical intuition. We further design a hierarchical PXRD pattern learning model and a multi-objective optimization approach to achieve high-quality representation and balanced optimization. Comprehensive evaluations on three mainstream databases (e.g., CCDC, CoREMOF, and InorganicData) demonstrate that XRDecoupler excels in performance, interpretability, and generalization.

Abstract: Bayesian inference, while foundational to probabilistic reasoning, is often hampered by the computational intractability of posterior distributions, particularly through the challenging evidence integral. Conventional approaches like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Variational Inference (VI) face significant scalability and efficiency limitations. This paper introduces a novel, unifying framework for fast Bayesian updates by leveraging harmonic analysis. We demonstrate that representing the prior and likelihood in a suitable orthogonal basis transforms the Bayesian update rule into a spectral convolution. Specifically, the Fourier coefficients of the posterior are shown to be the normalized convolution of the prior and likelihood coefficients. To achieve computational feasibility, we introduce a spectral truncation scheme, which, for smooth functions, yields an exceptionally accurate finite-dimensional approximation and reduces the update to a circular convolution. This formulation allows us to exploit the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), resulting in a deterministic algorithm with O(N log N) complexity -- a substantial improvement over the O(N^2) cost of naive methods. We establish rigorous mathematical criteria for the applicability of our method, linking its efficiency to the smoothness and spectral decay of the involved distributions. The presented work offers a paradigm shift, connecting Bayesian computation to signal processing and opening avenues for real-time, sequential inference in a wide class of problems.

Abstract: Strategic classification~(SC) explores how individuals or entities modify their features strategically to achieve favorable classification outcomes. However, existing SC methods, which are largely based on linear models or shallow neural networks, face significant limitations in terms of scalability and capacity when applied to real-world datasets with significantly increasing scale, especially in financial services and the internet sector. In this paper, we investigate how to leverage large language models to design a more scalable and efficient SC framework, especially in the case of growing individuals engaged with decision-making processes. Specifically, we introduce GLIM, a gradient-free SC method grounded in in-context learning. During the feed-forward process of self-attention, GLIM implicitly simulates the typical bi-level optimization process of SC, including both the feature manipulation and decision rule optimization. Without fine-tuning the LLMs, our proposed GLIM enjoys the advantage of cost-effective adaptation in dynamic strategic environments. Theoretically, we prove GLIM can support pre-trained LLMs to adapt to a broad range of strategic manipulations. We validate our approach through experiments with a collection of pre-trained LLMs on real-world and synthetic datasets in financial and internet domains, demonstrating that our GLIM exhibits both robustness and efficiency, and offering an effective solution for large-scale SC tasks.

Abstract: Anxiety disorders impact millions globally, yet traditional diagnosis relies on clinical interviews, while machine learning models struggle with overfitting due to limited data. Large-scale data collection remains costly and time-consuming, restricting accessibility. To address this, we introduce the Hyperbolic Curvature Few-Shot Learning Network (HCFSLN), a novel Few-Shot Learning (FSL) framework for multimodal anxiety detection, integrating speech, physiological signals, and video data. HCFSLN enhances feature separability through hyperbolic embeddings, cross-modal attention, and an adaptive gating network, enabling robust classification with minimal data. We collected a multimodal anxiety dataset from 108 participants and benchmarked HCFSLN against six FSL baselines, achieving 88% accuracy, outperforming the best baseline by 14%. These results highlight the effectiveness of hyperbolic space for modeling anxiety-related speech patterns and demonstrate FSL's potential for anxiety classification.

Abstract: Large models have achieved remarkable performance across a range of reasoning and understanding tasks. Prior work often utilizes model ensembles or multi-agent systems to collaboratively generate responses, effectively operating in a server-to-server paradigm. However, such approaches do not align well with practical deployment settings, where a limited number of server-side models are shared by many clients under modern internet architectures. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{CoLM} (\textbf{Co}llaboration in \textbf{L}arge-\textbf{M}odels), a novel framework for collaborative reasoning that redefines cooperation among large models from a client-server perspective. Unlike traditional ensemble methods that rely on simultaneous inference from multiple models to produce a single output, CoLM allows the outputs of multiple models to be aggregated or shared, enabling each client model to independently refine and update its own generation based on these high-quality outputs. This design enables collaborative benefits by fully leveraging both client-side and shared server-side models. We further extend CoLM to vision-language models (VLMs), demonstrating its applicability beyond language tasks. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks show that CoLM consistently improves model performance on previously failed queries, highlighting the effectiveness of collaborative guidance in enhancing single-model capabilities.

Abstract: Virtual screening (VS) is an essential task in drug discovery, focusing on the identification of small-molecule ligands that bind to specific protein pockets. Existing deep learning methods, from early regression models to recent contrastive learning approaches, primarily rely on structural data while overlooking protein sequences, which are more accessible and can enhance generalizability. However, directly integrating protein sequences poses challenges due to the redundancy and noise in large-scale protein-ligand datasets. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{S$^2$Drug}, a two-stage framework that explicitly incorporates protein \textbf{S}equence information and 3D \textbf{S}tructure context in protein-ligand contrastive representation learning. In the first stage, we perform protein sequence pretraining on ChemBL using an ESM2-based backbone, combined with a tailored data sampling strategy to reduce redundancy and noise on both protein and ligand sides. In the second stage, we fine-tune on PDBBind by fusing sequence and structure information through a residue-level gating module, while introducing an auxiliary binding site prediction task. This auxiliary task guides the model to accurately localize binding residues within the protein sequence and capture their 3D spatial arrangement, thereby refining protein-ligand matching. Across multiple benchmarks, S$^2$Drug consistently improves virtual screening performance and achieves strong results on binding site prediction, demonstrating the value of bridging sequence and structure in contrastive learning.

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD), which aims to detect outliers in graph-structured data, has received increasing research attention recently. However, existing GAD methods assume identical training and testing distributions, which is rarely valid in practice. In real-world scenarios, unseen but normal samples may emerge during deployment, leading to a normality shift that degrades the performance of GAD models trained on the original data. Through empirical analysis, we reveal that the degradation arises from (1) semantic confusion, where unseen normal samples are misinterpreted as anomalies due to their novel patterns, and (2) aggregation contamination, where the representations of seen normal nodes are distorted by unseen normals through message aggregation. While retraining or fine-tuning GAD models could be a potential solution to the above challenges, the high cost of model retraining and the difficulty of obtaining labeled data often render this approach impractical in real-world applications. To bridge the gap, we proposed a lightweight and plug-and-play Test-time adaptation framework for correcting Unseen Normal pattErns (TUNE) in GAD. To address semantic confusion, a graph aligner is employed to align the shifted data to the original one at the graph attribute level. Moreover, we utilize the minimization of representation-level shift as a supervision signal to train the aligner, which leverages the estimated aggregation contamination as a key indicator of normality shift. Extensive experiments on 10 real-world datasets demonstrate that TUNE significantly enhances the generalizability of pre-trained GAD models to both synthetic and real unseen normal patterns.

Abstract: Fairness concerns are increasingly critical as machine learning models are deployed in high-stakes applications. While existing fairness-aware methods typically intervene at the model level, they often suffer from high computational costs, limited scalability, and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we propose a Bayesian data selection framework that ensures fairness by aligning group-specific posterior distributions of model parameters and sample weights with a shared central distribution. Our framework supports flexible alignment via various distributional discrepancy measures, including Wasserstein distance, maximum mean discrepancy, and $f$-divergence, allowing geometry-aware control without imposing explicit fairness constraints. This data-centric approach mitigates group-specific biases in training data and improves fairness in downstream tasks, with theoretical guarantees. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method consistently outperforms existing data selection and model-based fairness methods in both fairness and accuracy.

Abstract: Deploying continuous-control reinforcement learning policies on embedded hardware requires meeting tight latency and power budgets. Small FPGAs can deliver these, but only if costly floating point pipelines are avoided. We study quantization-aware training (QAT) of policies for integer inference and we present a learning-to-hardware pipeline that automatically selects low-bit policies and synthesizes them to an Artix-7 FPGA. Across five MuJoCo tasks, we obtain policy networks that are competitive with full precision (FP32) policies but require as few as 3 or even only 2 bits per weight, and per internal activation value, as long as input precision is chosen carefully. On the target hardware, the selected policies achieve inference latencies on the order of microseconds and consume microjoules per action, favorably comparing to a quantized reference. Last, we observe that the quantized policies exhibit increased input noise robustness compared to the floating-point baseline.

Result: 攻击能够完美重建原始输入，证明质心披露在联邦聚类中会显著损害隐私。

Conclusion: 揭示了联邦聚类中隐私与效率之间的根本矛盾，质心披露会严重威胁隐私安全。

Abstract: Federated clustering allows multiple parties to discover patterns in distributed data without sharing raw samples. To reduce overhead, many protocols disclose intermediate centroids during training. While often treated as harmless for efficiency, whether such disclosure compromises privacy remains an open question. Prior analyses modeled the problem as a so-called Hidden Subset Sum Problem (HSSP) and argued that centroid release may be safe, since classical HSSP attacks fail to recover inputs.
  We revisit this question and uncover a new leakage mechanism: temporal regularities in $k$-means iterations create exploitable structure that enables perfect input reconstruction. Building on this insight, we propose Trajectory-Aware Reconstruction (TAR), an attack that combines temporal assignment information with algebraic analysis to recover exact original inputs. Our findings provide the first rigorous evidence, supported by a practical attack, that centroid disclosure in federated clustering significantly compromises privacy, exposing a fundamental tension between privacy and efficiency.

Abstract: We introduce a novel equivariant graph neural network (GNN) architecture designed to predict the tensorial response properties of molecules. Unlike traditional frameworks that focus on regressing scalar quantities and derive tensorial properties from their derivatives, our approach maintains $SO(3)$-equivariance through the use of local coordinate frames. Our GNN effectively captures geometric information by integrating scalar, vector, and tensor channels within a local message-passing framework. To assess the accuracy of our model, we apply it to predict the polarizabilities of molecules in the QM7-X dataset and show that tensorial message passing outperforms scalar message passing models. This work marks an advancement towards developing structured, geometry-aware neural models for molecular property prediction.

Abstract: Explicit latent variable models provide a flexible yet powerful framework for data synthesis, enabling controlled manipulation of generative factors. With latent variables drawn from a tractable probability density function that can be further constrained, these models enable continuous and semantically rich exploration of the output space by navigating their latent spaces. Structured latent representations are typically obtained through the joint minimization of regularization loss functions. In variational information bottleneck models, reconstruction loss and Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) are often linearly combined with an auxiliary Attribute-Regularization (AR) loss. However, balancing KLD and AR turns out to be a very delicate matter. When KLD dominates over AR, generative models tend to lack controllability; when AR dominates over KLD, the stochastic encoder is encouraged to violate the standard normal prior. We explore this trade-off in the context of symbolic music generation with explicit control over continuous musical attributes. We show that existing approaches struggle to jointly minimize both regularization objectives, whereas suitable attribute transformations can help achieve both controllability and regularization of the target latent dimensions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and causal learning each hold strong potential for clinical decision making (CDM). However, their synergy remains poorly understood, largely due to the lack of systematic benchmarks evaluating their integration in clinical risk prediction. In real-world healthcare, identifying features with causal influence on outcomes is crucial for actionable and trustworthy predictions. While recent work highlights LLMs' emerging causal reasoning abilities, there lacks comprehensive benchmarks to assess their causal learning and performance informed by causal features in clinical risk prediction. To address this, we introduce REACT-LLM, a benchmark designed to evaluate whether combining LLMs with causal features can enhance clinical prognostic performance and potentially outperform traditional machine learning (ML) methods. Unlike existing LLM-clinical benchmarks that often focus on a limited set of outcomes, REACT-LLM evaluates 7 clinical outcomes across 2 real-world datasets, comparing 15 prominent LLMs, 6 traditional ML models, and 3 causal discovery (CD) algorithms. Our findings indicate that while LLMs perform reasonably in clinical prognostics, they have not yet outperformed traditional ML models. Integrating causal features derived from CD algorithms into LLMs offers limited performance gains, primarily due to the strict assumptions of many CD methods, which are often violated in complex clinical data. While the direct integration yields limited improvement, our benchmark reveals a more promising synergy.

Abstract: Recent advances in latent diffusion models have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in high-dimensional time-series data synthesis while providing flexible control through conditioning and guidance. However, existing methodologies primarily rely on musical context or natural language as the main modality of interacting with the generative process, which may not be ideal for expert users who seek precise fader-like control over specific musical attributes. In this work, we explore the application of denoising diffusion processes as plug-and-play latent constraints for unconditional symbolic music generation models. We focus on a framework that leverages a library of small conditional diffusion models operating as implicit probabilistic priors on the latents of a frozen unconditional backbone. While previous studies have explored domain-specific use cases, this work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to demonstrate the versatility of such an approach across a diverse array of musical attributes, such as note density, pitch range, contour, and rhythm complexity. Our experiments show that diffusion-driven constraints outperform traditional attribute regularization and other latent constraints architectures, achieving significantly stronger correlations between target and generated attributes while maintaining high perceptual quality and diversity.

Abstract: Discovering functional crystalline materials entails navigating an immense combinatorial design space. While recent advances in generative artificial intelligence have enabled the sampling of chemically plausible compositions and structures, a fundamental challenge remains: the objective misalignment between likelihood-based sampling in generative modelling and targeted focus on underexplored regions where novel compounds reside. Here, we introduce a reinforcement learning framework that guides latent denoising diffusion models toward diverse and novel, yet thermodynamically viable crystalline compounds. Our approach integrates group relative policy optimisation with verifiable, multi-objective rewards that jointly balance creativity, stability, and diversity. Beyond de novo generation, we demonstrate enhanced property-guided design that preserves chemical validity, while targeting desired functional properties. This approach establishes a modular foundation for controllable AI-driven inverse design that addresses the novelty-validity trade-off across scientific discovery applications of generative models.

TL;DR: LRTrend是一个可解释的机器学习框架，通过聚合区域内多样化的健康和行为数据流，以及跨区域的疾病特定流行病网络，来实时识别疫情爆发。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 疫情爆发检测受到流行病时间序列高噪声的阻碍，而跨数据源的信息聚合在其他领域显示出强大的去噪能力，但在流行病学中仍未被充分探索。

Method: LRTrend框架在区域内聚合多样化的健康和行为数据流，并学习疾病特定的流行病网络来跨区域聚合信息。

Result: 揭示了美国各地不同的流行病集群和连接，这些连接无法用常用的人类移动网络很好解释，可能对未来公共卫生协调具有参考价值。在305个医院转诊区域的2年COVID-19数据应用中，LRTrend经常在疫情开始后2周内检测到区域性的Delta和Omicron浪潮，此时病例数仅为浪潮最终峰值的一小部分。

Conclusion: LRTrend能够有效识别疫情爆发，为实时疫情监测提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Responding to disease outbreaks requires close surveillance of their trajectories, but outbreak detection is hindered by the high noise in epidemic time series. Aggregating information across data sources has shown great denoising ability in other fields, but remains underexplored in epidemiology. Here, we present LRTrend, an interpretable machine learning framework to identify outbreaks in real time. LRTrend effectively aggregates diverse health and behavioral data streams within one region and learns disease-specific epidemic networks to aggregate information across regions. We reveal diverse epidemic clusters and connections across the United States that are not well explained by commonly used human mobility networks and may be informative for future public health coordination. We apply LRTrend to 2 years of COVID-19 data in 305 hospital referral regions and frequently detect regional Delta and Omicron waves within 2 weeks of the outbreak's start, when case counts are a small fraction of the wave's resulting peak.

Abstract: Label learning is a fundamental task in machine learning that aims to construct intelligent models using labeled data, encompassing traditional single-label and multi-label classification models. Traditional methods typically rely on logical labels, such as binary indicators (e.g., "yes/no") that specify whether an instance belongs to a given category. However, in practical applications, label annotations often involve significant uncertainty due to factors such as data noise, inherent ambiguity in the observed entities, and the subjectivity of human annotators. Therefore, representing labels using simplistic binary logic can obscure valuable information and limit the expressiveness of label learning models. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces the concept of fuzzy labels, grounded in fuzzy set theory, to better capture and represent label uncertainty. We further propose an efficient fuzzy labeling method that mines and generates fuzzy labels from the original data, thereby enriching the label space with more informative and nuanced representations. Based on this foundation, we present fuzzy-label-enhanced algorithms for both single-label and multi-label learning, using the classical K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and multi-label KNN algorithms as illustrative examples. Experimental results indicate that fuzzy labels can more effectively characterize the real-world labeling information and significantly enhance the performance of label learning models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种在严格查询限制下窃取图神经网络模型的方法，通过先获取模型主干再策略性地使用有限查询来提取最有价值的信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GNN模型窃取方法严重依赖对受害者模型的查询，假设没有严格的查询限制。但在现实中，允许的查询数量可能非常有限，需要开发在严格限制下仍能有效窃取模型的方法。

Method: 首先在不直接查询受害者模型的情况下获取模型主干，然后策略性地利用固定的查询限制来提取最有价值的数据。

Result: 在八个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，即使在非常严格的查询限制下以及存在模型提取防御措施的情况下，该攻击方法仍然有效。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了需要针对GNN模型提取威胁开发更强大的防御措施。

Abstract: Current graph neural network (GNN) model-stealing methods rely heavily on queries to the victim model, assuming no hard query limits. However, in reality, the number of allowed queries can be severely limited. In this paper, we demonstrate how an adversary can extract the GNN with very limited interactions with the model. Our approach first enables the adversary to obtain the model backbone without making direct queries to the victim model and then to strategically utilize a fixed query limit to extract the most informative data. The experiments on eight real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the attack, even under a very restricted query limit and under defense against model extraction in place. Our findings underscore the need for robust defenses against GNN model extraction threats.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive generalization abilities, yet adapting them effectively across multiple heterogeneous domains remains challenging due to inter-domain interference. To overcome this challenge, we propose a partition-based multi-stage fine-tuning framework designed to exploit inter-domain synergies while minimizing negative transfer. Our approach strategically partitions domains into subsets (stages) by balancing domain discrepancy, synergy, and model capacity constraints. We theoretically analyze the proposed framework and derive novel generalization bounds that justify our partitioning strategy. Extensive empirical evaluations on various language understanding tasks show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: SMiLE框架作为未来研究和应用的平台具有巨大潜力，能够有效解决神经网络属性强制执行的挑战。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence systems are increasingly deployed in settings where ensuring robustness, fairness, or domain-specific properties is essential for regulation compliance and alignment with human values. However, especially on Neural Networks, property enforcement is very challenging, and existing methods are limited to specific constraints or local properties (defined around datapoints), or fail to provide full guarantees. We tackle these limitations by extending SMiLE, a recently proposed enforcement framework for NNs, to support global relational properties (defined over the entire input space). The proposed approach scales well with model complexity, accommodates general properties and backbones, and provides full satisfaction guarantees. We evaluate SMiLE on monotonicity, global robustness, and individual fairness, on synthetic and real data, for regression and classification tasks. Our approach is competitive with property-specific baselines in terms of accuracy and runtime, and strictly superior in terms of generality and level of guarantees. Overall, our results emphasize the potential of the SMiLE framework as a platform for future research and applications.

Abstract: Chronic pain is a global health challenge affecting millions of individuals, making it essential for physicians to have reliable and objective methods to measure the functional impact of clinical treatments. Traditionally used methods, like the numeric rating scale, while personalized and easy to use, are subjective due to their self-reported nature. Thus, this paper proposes DETECT (Data-Driven Evaluation of Treatments Enabled by Classification Transformers), a data-driven framework that assesses treatment success by comparing patient activities of daily life before and after treatment. We use DETECT on public benchmark datasets and simulated patient data from smartphone sensors. Our results demonstrate that DETECT is objective yet lightweight, making it a significant and novel contribution to clinical decision-making. By using DETECT, independently or together with other self-reported metrics, physicians can improve their understanding of their treatment impacts, ultimately leading to more personalized and responsive patient care.

Abstract: We propose a deep neural-operator framework for a general class of probability models. Under global Lipschitz conditions on the operator over the entire Euclidean space-and for a broad class of probabilistic models-we establish a universal approximation theorem with explicit network-size bounds for the proposed architecture. The underlying stochastic processes are required only to satisfy integrability and general tail-probability conditions. We verify these assumptions for both European and American option-pricing problems within the forward-backward SDE (FBSDE) framework, which in turn covers a broad class of operators arising from parabolic PDEs, with or without free boundaries. Finally, we present a numerical example for a basket of American options, demonstrating that the learned model produces optimal stopping boundaries for new strike prices without retraining.

Abstract: Causal discovery is fundamental for multiple scientific domains, yet extracting causal information from real world data remains a significant challenge. Given the recent success on real data, we investigate whether TabPFN, a transformer-based tabular foundation model pre-trained on synthetic datasets generated from structural causal models, encodes causal information in its internal representations. We develop an adapter framework using a learnable decoder and causal tokens that extract causal signals from TabPFN's frozen embeddings and decode them into adjacency matrices for causal discovery. Our evaluations demonstrate that TabPFN's embeddings contain causal information, outperforming several traditional causal discovery algorithms, with such causal information being concentrated in mid-range layers. These findings establish a new direction for interpretable and adaptable foundation models and demonstrate the potential for leveraging pre-trained tabular models for causal discovery.

Abstract: Overparameterized fully-connected neural networks have been shown to behave like kernel models when trained with gradient descent, under mild conditions on the width, the learning rate, and the parameter initialization. In the limit of infinitely large widths and small learning rate, the kernel that is obtained allows to represent the output of the learned model with a closed-form solution. This closed-form solution hinges on the invertibility of the limiting kernel, a property that often holds on real-world datasets. In this work, we analyze the sensitivity of large ReLU networks to increasing depths by characterizing the corresponding limiting kernel. Our theoretical results demonstrate that the normalized limiting kernel approaches the matrix of ones. In contrast, they show the corresponding closed-form solution approaches a fixed limit on the sphere. We empirically evaluate the order of magnitude in network depth required to observe this convergent behavior, and we describe the essential properties that enable the generalization of our results to other kernels.

Conclusion: Multi-DProxy不仅能有效通过代理捕获用户兴趣，还能更精确地识别相关聚类，解决了多聚类中的语义刚性和兴趣识别问题。

Abstract: Multiple clustering aims to discover diverse latent structures from different perspectives, yet existing methods generate exhaustive clusterings without discerning user interest, necessitating laborious manual screening. Current multi-modal solutions suffer from static semantic rigidity: predefined candidate words fail to adapt to dataset-specific concepts, and fixed fusion strategies ignore evolving feature interactions. To overcome these limitations, we propose Multi-DProxy, a novel multi-modal dynamic proxy learning framework that leverages cross-modal alignment through learnable textual proxies. Multi-DProxy introduces 1) gated cross-modal fusion that synthesizes discriminative joint representations by adaptively modeling feature interactions. 2) dual-constraint proxy optimization where user interest constraints enforce semantic consistency with domain concepts while concept constraints employ hard example mining to enhance cluster discrimination. 3) dynamic candidate management that refines textual proxies through iterative clustering feedback. Therefore, Multi-DProxy not only effectively captures a user's interest through proxies but also enables the identification of relevant clusterings with greater precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements over existing methods across a broad set of multi-clustering benchmarks.

Abstract: In recent years, multimodal anomaly detection methods have demonstrated remarkable performance improvements over video-only models. However, real-world multimodal data is often corrupted due to unforeseen environmental distortions. In this paper, we present the first-of-its-kind work that comprehensively investigates the adverse effects of corrupted modalities on multimodal anomaly detection task. To streamline this work, we propose RobustA, a carefully curated evaluation dataset to systematically observe the impacts of audio and visual corruptions on the overall effectiveness of anomaly detection systems. Furthermore, we propose a multimodal anomaly detection method, which shows notable resilience against corrupted modalities. The proposed method learns a shared representation space for different modalities and employs a dynamic weighting scheme during inference based on the estimated level of corruption. Our work represents a significant step forward in enabling the real-world application of multimodal anomaly detection, addressing situations where the likely events of modality corruptions occur. The proposed evaluation dataset with corrupted modalities and respective extracted features will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Received signal strength indicator (RSSI) is the primary representation of Wi-Fi fingerprints and serves as a crucial tool for indoor localization. However, existing RSSI-based positioning methods often suffer from reduced accuracy due to environmental complexity and challenges in processing multi-source information. To address these issues, we propose a novel multi-graph heterogeneous GNN framework (MG-HGNN) to enhance spatial awareness and improve positioning performance. In this framework, two graph construction branches perform node and edge embedding, respectively, to generate informative graphs. Subsequently, a heterogeneous graph neural network is employed for graph representation learning, enabling accurate positioning. The MG-HGNN framework introduces the following key innovations: 1) multi-type task-directed graph construction that combines label estimation and feature encoding for richer graph information; 2) a heterogeneous GNN structure that enhances the performance of conventional GNN models. Evaluations on the UJIIndoorLoc and UTSIndoorLoc public datasets demonstrate that MG-HGNN not only achieves superior performance compared to several state-of-the-art methods, but also provides a novel perspective for enhancing GNN-based localization methods. Ablation studies further confirm the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Conclusion: 提出的离策略对抗模仿学习算法能够更高效地学习复杂策略，解决了现有模仿学习方法样本效率低的问题。

Abstract: Learning complex policies with Reinforcement Learning (RL) is often hindered by instability and slow convergence, a problem exacerbated by the difficulty of reward engineering. Imitation Learning (IL) from expert demonstrations bypasses this reliance on rewards. However, state-of-the-art IL methods, exemplified by Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL)Ho et. al, suffer from severe sample inefficiency. This is a direct consequence of their foundational on-policy algorithms, such as TRPO Schulman et.al. In this work, we introduce an adversarial imitation learning algorithm that incorporates off-policy learning to improve sample efficiency. By combining an off-policy framework with auxiliary techniques specifically, double Q network based stabilization and value learning without reward function inference we demonstrate a reduction in the samples required to robustly match expert behavior.

Abstract: Understanding the training dynamics of deep neural networks remains a major open problem, with physics-inspired approaches offering promising insights. Building on this perspective, we develop a thermodynamic framework to describe the stationary distributions of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with weight decay for scale-invariant neural networks, a setting that both reflects practical architectures with normalization layers and permits theoretical analysis. We establish analogies between training hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, weight decay) and thermodynamic variables such as temperature, pressure, and volume. Starting with a simplified isotropic noise model, we uncover a close correspondence between SGD dynamics and ideal gas behavior, validated through theory and simulation. Extending to training of neural networks, we show that key predictions of the framework, including the behavior of stationary entropy, align closely with experimental observations. This framework provides a principled foundation for interpreting training dynamics and may guide future work on hyperparameter tuning and the design of learning rate schedulers.

Abstract: Few classical games have been regarded as such significant benchmarks of artificial intelligence as to have justified training costs in the millions of dollars. Among these, Stratego -- a board wargame exemplifying the challenge of strategic decision making under massive amounts of hidden information -- stands apart as a case where such efforts failed to produce performance at the level of top humans. This work establishes a step change in both performance and cost for Stratego, showing that it is now possible not only to reach the level of top humans, but to achieve vastly superhuman level -- and that doing so requires not an industrial budget, but merely a few thousand dollars. We achieved this result by developing general approaches for self-play reinforcement learning and test-time search under imperfect information.

Conclusion: Q-RAG为多步检索提供了竞争性强且资源高效的解决方案

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods enhance LLM performance by efficiently filtering relevant context for LLMs, reducing hallucinations and inference cost. However, most existing RAG methods focus on single-step retrieval, which is often insufficient for answering complex questions that require multi-step search. Recently, multi-step retrieval approaches have emerged, typically involving the fine-tuning of small LLMs to perform multi-step retrieval. This type of fine-tuning is highly resource-intensive and does not enable the use of larger LLMs. In this work, we propose Q-RAG, a novel approach that fine-tunes the Embedder model for multi-step retrieval using reinforcement learning (RL). Q-RAG offers a competitive, resource-efficient alternative to existing multi-step retrieval methods for open-domain question answering and achieves state-of-the-art results on the popular long-context benchmarks Babilong and RULER for contexts up to 10M tokens.

Abstract: It introduces FractalNet, a fractal-inspired computational architectures for advanced large language model analysis that mainly challenges model diversity on a large scale in an efficient manner. The new set-up involves a template-driven generator, runner, and evaluation framework that, through systematic permutations of convolutional, normalization, activation, and dropout layers, can create more than 1,200 variants of neural networks. Fractal templates allow for structural recursion and multi-column pathways, thus, models become deeper and wider in a balanced way. Training utilizes PyTorch, Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP), and gradient checkpointing and is carried out on the CIFAR-10 dataset for five epochs. The outcomes show that fractal-based architectures are capable of strong performance and are computationally efficient.

Conclusion: 高质量、专家驱动的数据集对于推进通用计算机使用代理的发展具有关键作用。

Abstract: Building reliable computer-use agents requires grounding: accurately connecting natural language instructions to the correct on-screen elements. While large datasets exist for web and mobile interactions, high-quality resources for desktop environments are limited. To address this gap, we introduce GroundCUA, a large-scale desktop grounding dataset built from expert human demonstrations. It covers 87 applications across 12 categories and includes 56K screenshots, with every on-screen element carefully annotated for a total of over 3.56M human-verified annotations. From these demonstrations, we generate diverse instructions that capture a wide range of real-world tasks, providing high-quality data for model training. Using GroundCUA, we develop the GroundNext family of models that map instructions to their target UI elements. At both 3B and 7B scales, GroundNext achieves state-of-the-art results across five benchmarks using supervised fine-tuning, while requiring less than one-tenth the training data of prior work. Reinforcement learning post-training further improves performance, and when evaluated in an agentic setting on the OSWorld benchmark using o3 as planner, GroundNext attains comparable or superior results to models trained with substantially more data,. These results demonstrate the critical role of high-quality, expert-driven datasets in advancing general-purpose computer-use agents.

TL;DR: TNT是一种新的训练范式，通过两阶段过程解决深度记忆RNN训练效率问题：第一阶段使用分层内存进行高效预训练，第二阶段进行简短微调，在保持准确性的同时实现17倍训练加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度记忆RNN（如Titans和TTT）虽然具有线性扩展潜力，但由于训练速度过慢和硬件利用率低，其潜力未被充分挖掘。现有并行化方法在速度和性能之间存在根本冲突。

Method: TNT采用两阶段训练：第一阶段使用分层内存进行效率优先的预训练，全局模块处理大块上下文，并行局部模块处理细节，通过定期重置局部内存状态打破顺序依赖；第二阶段仅对局部内存模块进行小批量微调。

Result: 在Titans和TTT模型上，TNT实现了高达17倍的训练加速，同时提高了模型准确性，突破了RNN的可扩展性瓶颈。

Conclusion: TNT为开发表达性RNN建立了实用基础，有助于未来缩小与Transformer的性能差距。

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with deep test-time memorization modules, such as Titans and TTT, represent a promising, linearly-scaling paradigm distinct from Transformers. While these expressive models do not yet match the peak performance of state-of-the-art Transformers, their potential has been largely untapped due to prohibitively slow training and low hardware utilization. Existing parallelization methods force a fundamental conflict governed by the chunksize hyperparameter: large chunks boost speed but degrade performance, necessitating a fixed, suboptimal compromise. To solve this challenge, we introduce TNT, a novel training paradigm that decouples training efficiency from inference performance through a two-stage process. Stage one is an efficiency-focused pre-training phase utilizing a hierarchical memory. A global module processes large, hardware-friendly chunks for long-range context, while multiple parallel local modules handle fine-grained details. Crucially, by periodically resetting local memory states, we break sequential dependencies to enable massive context parallelization. Stage two is a brief fine-tuning phase where only the local memory modules are adapted to a smaller, high-resolution chunksize, maximizing accuracy with minimal overhead. Evaluated on Titans and TTT models, TNT achieves a substantial acceleration in training speed-up to 17 times faster than the most accurate baseline configuration - while simultaneously improving model accuracy. This improvement removes a critical scalability barrier, establishing a practical foundation for developing expressive RNNs and facilitating future work to close the performance gap with Transformers.

Motivation: 线性回归广泛应用于各领域，但涉及敏感数据时需要保护隐私。现有差分私有方法通常生成带噪声的参数估计，我们希望开发能发布私有数据集草图的方法，既保护隐私又便于使用标准求解器。

Method: 开发差分私有草图方法，针对最小二乘回归和最小绝对偏差回归问题，生成数据集的私有草图表示，而非直接估计带噪声的参数向量。

Result: 提出的私有草图方法能够在保护隐私的前提下，支持使用常见的回归求解器进行分析，避免了隐私泄露风险。

Conclusion: 通过发布差分私有数据集草图而非噪声参数估计，为线性回归提供了更灵活且隐私安全的解决方案，便于实际应用中的标准工具集成。

Abstract: Linear regression is frequently applied in a variety of domains. In order to improve the efficiency of these methods, various methods have been developed that compute summaries or \emph{sketches} of the datasets. Certain domains, however, contain sensitive data which necessitates that the application of these statistical methods does not reveal private information. Differentially private (DP) linear regression methods have been developed for mitigating this problem. These techniques typically involve estimating a noisy version of the parameter vector. Instead, we propose releasing private sketches of the datasets. We present differentially private sketches for the problems of least squares regression, as well as least absolute deviations regression. The availability of these private sketches facilitates the application of commonly available solvers for regression, without the risk of privacy leakage.

TL;DR: 本文通过树状马尔可夫链模型解释了后训练中的探索悖论：虽然RLVR和ORM/PRM主要强化现有推理路径，但探索仍至关重要，因为它保留了解决困难问题所需的罕见推理路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基础模型后训练中的探索悖论：为什么探索能提高性能，即使它不产生新的推理模式，而只是强化现有路径。

Method: 采用多任务树状马尔可夫链模型，将预训练视为树扩展，后训练视为思维链重加权，分析RLVR的挤压效应和ORM/PRM的一致性偏好。

Result: 理论分析显示：RLVR会挤压推理熵并遗忘正确路径；ORM/PRM奖励一致性而非准确性；罕见的高不确定性推理路径对解决困难问题至关重要。

Conclusion: 探索之所以重要，是因为它保留了基础模型中罕见但关键的推理路径，这些路径在RLVR中被挤压或在推理缩放中不受青睐，对解决困难问题实例至关重要。

Abstract: Foundation models exhibit broad knowledge but limited task-specific reasoning, motivating post-training strategies such as RLVR and inference scaling with outcome or process reward models (ORM/PRM). While recent work highlights the role of exploration and entropy stability in improving pass@K, empirical evidence points to a paradox: RLVR and ORM/PRM typically reinforce existing tree-like reasoning paths rather than expanding the reasoning scope, raising the question of why exploration helps at all if no new patterns emerge.
  To reconcile this paradox, we adopt the perspective of Kim et al. (2025), viewing easy (e.g., simplifying a fraction) versus hard (e.g., discovering a symmetry) reasoning steps as low- versus high-probability Markov transitions, and formalize post-training dynamics through Multi-task Tree-structured Markov Chains (TMC). In this tractable model, pretraining corresponds to tree expansion, while post-training corresponds to chain-of-thought reweighting. We show that several phenomena recently observed in empirical studies arise naturally in this setting: (1) RLVR induces a squeezing effect, reducing reasoning entropy and forgetting some correct paths; (2) population rewards of ORM/PRM encourage consistency rather than accuracy, thereby favoring common patterns; and (3) certain rare, high-uncertainty reasoning paths by the base model are responsible for solving hard problem instances.
  Together, these explain why exploration -- even when confined to the base model's reasoning scope -- remains essential: it preserves access to rare but crucial reasoning traces needed for difficult cases, which are squeezed out by RLVR or unfavored by inference scaling. Building on this, we further show that exploration strategies such as rejecting easy instances and KL regularization help preserve rare reasoning traces. Empirical simulations corroborate our theoretical results.

Abstract: Recent curriculum techniques in the post-training stage of LLMs have been widely observed to outperform non-curriculum approaches in enhancing reasoning performance, yet a principled understanding of why and to what extent they work remains elusive. To address this gap, we develop a theoretical framework grounded in the intuition that progressively learning through manageable steps is more efficient than directly tackling a hard reasoning task, provided each stage stays within the model's effective competence. Under mild complexity conditions linking consecutive curriculum stages, we show that curriculum post-training avoids the exponential complexity bottleneck.
  To substantiate this result, drawing insights from the Chain-of-Thoughts (CoTs) solving mathematical problems such as Countdown and parity, we model CoT generation as a states-conditioned autoregressive reasoning tree, define a uniform-branching base model to capture pretrained behavior, and formalize curriculum stages as either depth-increasing (longer reasoning chains) or hint-decreasing (shorter prefixes) subtasks. Our analysis shows that, under outcome-only reward signals, reinforcement learning finetuning achieves high accuracy with polynomial sample complexity, whereas direct learning suffers from an exponential bottleneck. We further establish analogous guarantees for test-time scaling, where curriculum-aware querying reduces both reward oracle calls and sampling cost from exponential to polynomial order.

Conclusion: Transformer在状态跟踪任务中的长度泛化能力由注意力集中机制决定，递归自训练可以有效扩展推理长度范围，为AI推理提供了重要的理论保证。

Abstract: The ability to reason lies at the core of artificial intelligence (AI), and challenging problems usually call for deeper and longer reasoning to tackle. A crucial question about AI reasoning is whether models can extrapolate learned reasoning patterns to solve harder tasks with longer chain-of-thought (CoT). In this work, we present a theoretical analysis of transformers learning on synthetic state-tracking tasks with gradient descent. We mathematically prove how the algebraic structure of state-tracking problems governs the degree of extrapolation of the learned CoT. Specifically, our theory characterizes the length generalization of transformers through the mechanism of attention concentration, linking the retrieval robustness of the attention layer to the state-tracking task structure of long-context reasoning. Moreover, for transformers with limited reasoning length, we prove that a recursive self-training scheme can progressively extend the range of solvable problem lengths. To our knowledge, we provide the first optimization guarantee that constant-depth transformers provably learn $\mathsf{NC}^1$-complete problems with CoT, significantly going beyond prior art confined in $\mathsf{TC}^0$, unless the widely held conjecture $\mathsf{TC}^0 \neq \mathsf{NC}^1$ fails. Finally, we present a broad set of experiments supporting our theoretical results, confirming the length generalization behaviors and the mechanism of attention concentration.

Abstract: Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) are increasingly used in high-stakes domains, such as financial forecasting, recommendation systems, and fraud detection. However, their susceptibility to poisoning attacks poses a critical security risk. We introduce LoReTTA (Low Resource Two-phase Temporal Attack), a novel adversarial framework on Continuous-Time Dynamic Graphs, which degrades TGNN performance by an average of 29.47% across 4 widely benchmark datasets and 4 State-of-the-Art (SotA) models. LoReTTA operates through a two-stage approach: (1) sparsify the graph by removing high-impact edges using any of the 16 tested temporal importance metrics, (2) strategically replace removed edges with adversarial negatives via LoReTTA's novel degree-preserving negative sampling algorithm. Our plug-and-play design eliminates the need for expensive surrogate models while adhering to realistic unnoticeability constraints. LoReTTA degrades performance by upto 42.0% on MOOC, 31.5% on Wikipedia, 28.8% on UCI, and 15.6% on Enron. LoReTTA outperforms 11 attack baselines, remains undetectable to 4 leading anomaly detection systems, and is robust to 4 SotA adversarial defense training methods, establishing its effectiveness, unnoticeability, and robustness.

Conclusion: SCISOR模型能够有效缩短长蛋白质序列，生成更真实的蛋白质并更好地保留功能，为蛋白质工程提供了强大的工具。

Abstract: Many proteins useful in modern medicine or bioengineering are challenging to make in the lab, fuse with other proteins in cells, or deliver to tissues in the body, because their sequences are too long. Shortening these sequences typically involves costly, time-consuming experimental campaigns. Ideally, we could instead use modern models of massive databases of sequences from nature to learn how to propose shrunken proteins that resemble sequences found in nature. Unfortunately, these models struggle to efficiently search the combinatorial space of all deletions, and are not trained with inductive biases to learn how to delete. To address this gap, we propose SCISOR, a novel discrete diffusion model that deletes letters from sequences to generate protein samples that resemble those found in nature. To do so, SCISOR trains a de-noiser to reverse a forward noising process that adds random insertions to natural sequences. As a generative model, SCISOR fits evolutionary sequence data competitively with previous large models. In evaluation, SCISOR achieves state-of-the-art predictions of the functional effects of deletions on ProteinGym. Finally, we use the SCISOR de-noiser to shrink long protein sequences, and show that its suggested deletions result in significantly more realistic proteins and more often preserve functional motifs than previous models of evolutionary sequences.

Conclusion: 原则性的无标签级联优化能够实现可扩展的LLM部署，为实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results on complex reasoning tasks, but their high inference cost remains a major barrier to real-world deployment. A promising solution is to use cascaded inference, where small, cheap models handle easy queries, and only the hardest examples are escalated to more powerful models. However, existing cascade methods typically rely on supervised training with labeled data, offer no theoretical generalization guarantees, and provide limited control over test-time computational cost. We introduce C3PO (Cost Controlled Cascaded Prediction Optimization), a self-supervised framework for optimizing LLM cascades under probabilistic cost constraints. By focusing on minimizing regret with respect to the most powerful model (MPM), C3PO avoids the need for labeled data by constructing a cascade using only unlabeled model outputs. It leverages conformal prediction to bound the probability that inference cost exceeds a user-specified budget. We provide theoretical guarantees on both cost control and generalization error, and show that our optimization procedure is effective even with small calibration sets. Empirically, C3PO achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse set of reasoning benchmarks including GSM8K, MATH-500, BigBench-Hard and AIME, outperforming strong LLM cascading baselines in both accuracy and cost-efficiency. Our results demonstrate that principled, label-free cascade optimization can enable scalable LLM deployment.

Conclusion: EntangledSBM为学习相互作用多粒子系统的随机动力学提供了一个有效的框架。

Abstract: Simulating trajectories of multi-particle systems on complex energy landscapes is a central task in molecular dynamics (MD) and drug discovery, but remains challenging at scale due to computationally expensive and long simulations. Previous approaches leverage techniques such as flow or Schrödinger bridge matching to implicitly learn joint trajectories through data snapshots. However, many systems, including biomolecular systems and heterogeneous cell populations, undergo dynamic interactions that evolve over their trajectory and cannot be captured through static snapshots. To close this gap, we introduce Entangled Schrödinger Bridge Matching (EntangledSBM), a framework that learns the first- and second-order stochastic dynamics of interacting, multi-particle systems where the direction and magnitude of each particle's path depend dynamically on the paths of the other particles. We define the Entangled Schrödinger Bridge (EntangledSB) problem as solving a coupled system of bias forces that entangle particle velocities. We show that our framework accurately simulates heterogeneous cell populations under perturbations and rare transitions in high-dimensional biomolecular systems.

TL;DR: 提出RoMA方法，通过路由流形对齐来改善MoE LLMs中路由器的性能，仅需轻量级微调即可显著提升模型泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MoE LLMs中的路由器在下游任务中表现不佳，与最优路由存在10-20%的性能差距，这限制了模型的泛化能力。

Method: RoMA方法在训练目标中引入流形正则化项，鼓励样本的路由权重在任务嵌入空间中接近其成功邻居的路由权重，从而在相似任务间共享专家选择。

Result: 在OLMoE、DeepSeekMoE和Qwen3-MoE上的实验表明，RoMA能显著提升模型在多样化基准测试中的性能。

Conclusion: RoMA成功地将任务理解与解决方案生成统一起来，为MoE LLMs提供了更好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) have been widely adopted in recent large language models since it can efficiently scale up the model capability without increasing the inference cost. However, evaluations on broad downstream tasks reveal a consistent suboptimality of the routers in existing MoE LLMs, which results in a severe performance gap (e.g., 10-20% in accuracy) to the optimal routing. In this paper, we show that aligning the manifold of routing weights with that of task embedding can effectively reduce the gap and improve MoE LLMs' generalization performance. Our method, "Routing Manifold Alignment (RoMA)", introduces an additional manifold regularization term in the post-training objective and only requires lightweight finetuning of routers (with other parameters frozen). Specifically, the regularization encourages the routing weights of each sample to be close to those of its successful neighbors (whose routing weights lead to correct answers) in a task embedding space. Consequently, samples targeting similar tasks will share similar expert choices across layers. Building such bindings between tasks and experts over different samples is essential to achieve better generalization. Moreover, RoMA demonstrates the advantage of unifying the task understanding (by embedding models) with solution generation (by MoE LLMs). In experiments, we finetune routers in OLMoE, DeepSeekMoE, and Qwen3-MoE using RoMA. Evaluations on diverse benchmarks and extensive comparisons with baselines show the substantial improvement brought by RoMA.
