Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeuralSSD是一种基于神经Galerkin方法的3D隐式表面重建方法，能从点云数据重建高质量准确的表面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐式场参数化方法缺乏确保表面与输入数据紧密拟合的显式机制，需要解决点云信息可靠性的平衡问题。

Method: 提出新的能量方程平衡点云信息可靠性，并引入学习三维信息的新卷积网络以实现更优优化结果。

Result: 在ShapeNet和Matterport等挑战性数据集上评估，在表面重建精度和泛化性方面达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: 该方法确保重建表面紧密贴合原始输入点，并从点云推断有价值的归纳偏置，实现高精度稳定的表面重建。

Abstract: We proposed a generalized method, NeuralSSD, for reconstructing a 3D implicit surface from the widely-available point cloud data. NeuralSSD is a solver-based on the neural Galerkin method, aimed at reconstructing higher-quality and accurate surfaces from input point clouds. Implicit method is preferred due to its ability to accurately represent shapes and its robustness in handling topological changes. However, existing parameterizations of implicit fields lack explicit mechanisms to ensure a tight fit between the surface and input data. To address this, we propose a novel energy equation that balances the reliability of point cloud information. Additionally, we introduce a new convolutional network that learns three-dimensional information to achieve superior optimization results. This approach ensures that the reconstructed surface closely adheres to the raw input points and infers valuable inductive biases from point clouds, resulting in a highly accurate and stable surface reconstruction. NeuralSSD is evaluated on a variety of challenging datasets, including the ShapeNet and Matterport datasets, and achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of both surface reconstruction accuracy and generalizability.

*Stefan Cobeli,Kazi Shahrukh Omar,Rodrigo Valença,Nivan Ferreira,Fabio Miranda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于神经场的3D城市环境隐式表示方法，通过向量场编码视图信息，支持快速直接查询和逆向查询，用于城市分析任务如可见性评估、日照分析和视觉影响评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D城市数据集日益增多，但由于计算瓶颈和数据交互复杂性，提取洞察仍然困难。复杂的3D城市几何导致高度遮挡，需要大量手动视角调整，使得大规模探索效率低下。

Conclusion: 该方法为3D城市数据分析提供了一种高效的视图探索方法，支持关键城市分析任务，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Despite the growing availability of 3D urban datasets, extracting insights remains challenging due to computational bottlenecks and the complexity of interacting with data. In fact, the intricate geometry of 3D urban environments results in high degrees of occlusion and requires extensive manual viewpoint adjustments that make large-scale exploration inefficient. To address this, we propose a view-based approach for 3D data exploration, where a vector field encodes views from the environment. To support this approach, we introduce a neural field-based method that constructs an efficient implicit representation of 3D environments. This representation enables both faster direct queries, which consist of the computation of view assessment indices, and inverse queries, which help avoid occlusion and facilitate the search for views that match desired data patterns. Our approach supports key urban analysis tasks such as visibility assessments, solar exposure evaluation, and assessing the visual impact of new developments. We validate our method through quantitative experiments, case studies informed by real-world urban challenges, and feedback from domain experts. Results show its effectiveness in finding desirable viewpoints, analyzing building facade visibility, and evaluating views from outdoor spaces.

### [3] [nuCarla: A nuScenes-Style Bird's-Eye View Perception Dataset for CARLA Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13744)
*Zhijie Qiao,Zhong Cao,Henry X. Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: nuCarla是一个在CARLA模拟器中构建的大规模BEV感知数据集，解决了端到端自动驾驶缺乏标准化闭环测试数据的问题，提供与nuScenes格式兼容的数据和模型基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动驾驶数据集主要来自真实世界的非交互条件，仅支持开环学习，缺乏标准化、大规模的数据集来促进中间表示学习，导致闭环端到端模型性能落后于简单规则基线。

Method: 在CARLA模拟器中构建nuScenes风格的大规模BEV感知数据集nuCarla，具有完全兼容nuScenes格式、数据集规模相当但类别分布更均衡、可直接用于闭环模拟部署等特点。

Result: nuCarla提供了高性能BEV骨干网络，实现了最先进的检测结果，并作为开放基准加速闭环端到端自动驾驶开发。

Conclusion: nuCarla通过提供数据和模型基准，显著加速了闭环端到端自动驾驶的发展，为可靠和安全感知的自动驾驶研究铺平了道路。

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving heavily relies on closed-loop simulation, where perception, planning, and control are jointly trained and evaluated in interactive environments. Yet, most existing datasets are collected from the real world under non-interactive conditions, primarily supporting open-loop learning while offering limited value for closed-loop testing. Due to the lack of standardized, large-scale, and thoroughly verified datasets to facilitate learning of meaningful intermediate representations, such as bird's-eye-view (BEV) features, closed-loop E2E models remain far behind even simple rule-based baselines. To address this challenge, we introduce nuCarla, a large-scale, nuScenes-style BEV perception dataset built within the CARLA simulator. nuCarla features (1) full compatibility with the nuScenes format, enabling seamless transfer of real-world perception models; (2) a dataset scale comparable to nuScenes, but with more balanced class distributions; (3) direct usability for closed-loop simulation deployment; and (4) high-performance BEV backbones that achieve state-of-the-art detection results. By providing both data and models as open benchmarks, nuCarla substantially accelerates closed-loop E2E development, paving the way toward reliable and safety-aware research in autonomous driving.

### [4] [Known Meets Unknown: Mitigating Overconfidence in Open Set Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13775)
*Dongdong Zhao,Ranxin Fang,Changtian Song,Zhihui Liu,Jianwen Xiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个框架来解决开放集识别中的过度自信问题，通过扰动不确定性估计和两阶段未知检测来增强已知与未知类别的区分能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放集识别中，当未知样本与已知类别语义相似时，模型会过度自信地将未知样本误分类为已知类别，这削弱了开放集识别的性能。

Method: 框架包含两个组件：基于扰动的不确定性估计模块（通过参数扰动生成多样预测并量化不确定性）和两阶段学习分类器的未知检测模块（利用估计的不确定性改进已知与未知类别的区分）。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上的实验结果表明，所提框架优于现有的开放集识别方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过显式缓解类别间重叠引起的过度自信问题，有效提升了开放集识别的性能。

Abstract: Open Set Recognition (OSR) requires models not only to accurately classify known classes but also to effectively reject unknown samples. However, when unknown samples are semantically similar to known classes, inter-class overlap in the feature space often causes models to assign unjustifiably high confidence to them, leading to misclassification as known classes -- a phenomenon known as overconfidence. This overconfidence undermines OSR by blurring the decision boundary between known and unknown classes. To address this issue, we propose a framework that explicitly mitigates overconfidence caused by inter-class overlap. The framework consists of two components: a perturbation-based uncertainty estimation module, which applies controllable parameter perturbations to generate diverse predictions and quantify predictive uncertainty, and an unknown detection module with distinct learning-based classifiers, implemented as a two-stage procedure, which leverages the estimated uncertainty to improve discrimination between known and unknown classes, thereby enhancing OSR performance. Experimental results on three public datasets show that the proposed framework achieves superior performance over existing OSR methods.

### [5] [Temporal Object-Aware Vision Transformer for Few-Shot Video Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13784)
*Yogesh Kumar,Anand Mishra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于少样本视频目标检测的新方法，通过选择性传播高置信度目标特征来保持时间一致性，在多个数据集上实现了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统检测方法需要大量训练数据的问题，应对视频中目标遮挡和外观变化带来的时间一致性挑战，避免使用计算复杂且需要任务特定训练的区域提议方法。

Method: 采用目标感知的时间建模方法，包含过滤机制选择性传播跨帧的高置信度目标特征，使用少样本训练的检测和分类头进行聚焦特征传播。

Result: 在5-shot设置下，AP提升分别为：FSVOD-500 3.7%、FSYTV-40 5.3%、VidOR 4.3%、VidVRD 4.5%。在1-shot、3-shot和10-shot配置下也显示出改进。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在少样本设置下实现稳健的时间一致性，无需依赖显式目标管提议，在多个基准数据集上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Few-shot Video Object Detection (FSVOD) addresses the challenge of detecting novel objects in videos with limited labeled examples, overcoming the constraints of traditional detection methods that require extensive training data. This task presents key challenges, including maintaining temporal consistency across frames affected by occlusion and appearance variations, and achieving novel object generalization without relying on complex region proposals, which are often computationally expensive and require task-specific training. Our novel object-aware temporal modeling approach addresses these challenges by incorporating a filtering mechanism that selectively propagates high-confidence object features across frames. This enables efficient feature progression, reduces noise accumulation, and enhances detection accuracy in a few-shot setting. By utilizing few-shot trained detection and classification heads with focused feature propagation, we achieve robust temporal consistency without depending on explicit object tube proposals. Our approach achieves performance gains, with AP improvements of 3.7% (FSVOD-500), 5.3% (FSYTV-40), 4.3% (VidOR), and 4.5 (VidVRD) in the 5-shot setting. Further results demonstrate improvements in 1-shot, 3-shot, and 10-shot configurations. We make the code public at: https://github.com/yogesh-iitj/fs-video-vit

### [6] [FusionFM: All-in-One Multi-Modal Image Fusion with Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13794)
*Huayi Zhu,Xiu Shu,Youqiang Xiong,Qiao Liu,Rui Chen,Di Yuan,Xiaojun Chang,Zhenyu He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于流匹配的图像融合方法，通过概率传输从源模态直接生成融合图像，提高采样效率和结构一致性，无需高质量融合图像监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前多模态图像融合方法依赖任务特定模型导致训练成本高、扩展性差的问题，以及生成方法采样效率低的问题。

Method: 使用流匹配范式进行概率传输，收集SOTA模型结果作为先验，任务感知选择可靠伪标签，引入融合精炼模块分解增强退化组件，集成弹性权重巩固和经验回放机制。

Result: 在多种融合任务中取得竞争性性能，显著提高采样效率，保持轻量级模型设计。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为多模态图像融合提供了高效统一的解决方案，在保持性能的同时显著提升效率。

Abstract: Current multi-modal image fusion methods typically rely on task-specific models, leading to high training costs and limited scalability. While generative methods provide a unified modeling perspective, they often suffer from slow inference due to the complex sampling trajectories from noise to image. To address this, we formulate image fusion as a direct probabilistic transport from source modalities to the fused image distribution, leveraging the flow matching paradigm to improve sampling efficiency and structural consistency. To mitigate the lack of high-quality fused images for supervision, we collect fusion results from multiple state-of-the-art models as priors, and employ a task-aware selection function to select the most reliable pseudo-labels for each task. We further introduce a Fusion Refiner module that employs a divide-and-conquer strategy to systematically identify, decompose, and enhance degraded components in selected pseudo-labels. For multi-task scenarios, we integrate elastic weight consolidation and experience replay mechanisms to preserve cross-task performance and enhance continual learning ability from both parameter stability and memory retention perspectives. Our approach achieves competitive performance across diverse fusion tasks, while significantly improving sampling efficiency and maintaining a lightweight model design. The code will be available at: https://github.com/Ist-Zhy/FusionFM.

### [7] [A Trajectory-free Crash Detection Framework with Generative Approach and Segment Map Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13795)
*Weiying Shen,Hao Yu,Yu Dong,Pan Liu,Yu Han,Xin Wen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的两阶段无轨迹碰撞检测框架，通过生成合理的未来路段地图并与实际监测地图对比来检测碰撞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统基于轨迹获取和车辆跟踪的碰撞检测方法的局限性，利用路段地图记录个体级交通动态数据直接进行碰撞检测。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段使用Mapfusion扩散模型生成未来路段地图，通过噪声添加和去噪过程学习运动模式；第二阶段通过比较监测地图与生成地图来检测碰撞。

Result: Mapfusion能够基于学习的运动模式生成真实的路段演化地图，在不同采样间隔下保持鲁棒性，在真实世界碰撞实验中准确检测碰撞。

Conclusion: 提出的两阶段方法在碰撞检测方面有效，解决了轨迹获取的局限性，为主动安全管理策略提供了支持。

Abstract: Real-time crash detection is essential for developing proactive safety management strategy and enhancing overall traffic efficiency. To address the limitations associated with trajectory acquisition and vehicle tracking, road segment maps recording the individual-level traffic dynamic data were directly served in crash detection. A novel two-stage trajectory-free crash detection framework, was present to generate the rational future road segment map and identify crashes. The first-stage diffusion-based segment map generation model, Mapfusion, conducts a noisy-to-normal process that progressively adds noise to the road segment map until the map is corrupted to pure Gaussian noise. The denoising process is guided by sequential embedding components capturing the temporal dynamics of segment map sequences. Furthermore, the generation model is designed to incorporate background context through ControlNet to enhance generation control. Crash detection is achieved by comparing the monitored segment map with the generations from diffusion model in second stage. Trained on non-crash vehicle motion data, Mapfusion successfully generates realistic road segment evolution maps based on learned motion patterns and remains robust across different sampling intervals. Experiments on real-world crashes indicate the effectiveness of the proposed two-stage method in accurately detecting crashes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对地震数据的自适应双网格基础模型训练策略（ADATG），通过希尔伯特编码和频谱分解来有效处理地震数据中的高频和低频特征，解决了现有视觉变换器在地震数据处理中的局限性。


<details>

Abstract: Due to the emergency and homogenization of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology development, transformer-based foundation models have revolutionized scientific applications, such as drug discovery, materials research, and astronomy. However, seismic data presents unique characteristics that require specialized processing techniques for pretraining foundation models in seismic contexts with high- and low-frequency features playing crucial roles. Existing vision transformers (ViTs) with sequential tokenization ignore the intrinsic pattern and fail to grasp both the high- and low-frequency seismic information efficiently and effectively. This work introduces a novel adaptive two-grid foundation model training strategy (ADATG) with Hilbert encoding specifically tailored for seismogram data, leveraging the hierarchical structures inherent in seismic data. Specifically, our approach employs spectrum decomposition to separate high- and low-frequency components and utilizes hierarchical Hilbert encoding to represent the data effectively. Moreover, observing the frequency principle observed in ViTs, we propose an adaptive training strategy that initially emphasizes coarse-level information and then progressively refines the model's focus on fine-level features. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our training methods. This research highlights the importance of data encoding and training strategies informed by the distinct characteristics of high- and low-frequency features in seismic images, ultimately contributing to the enhancement of visual seismic foundation models pretraining.

### [9] [Passive Dementia Screening via Facial Temporal Micro-Dynamics Analysis of In-the-Wild Talking-Head Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13802)
*Filippo Cenacchi. Longbing Cao,Mitchell McEwan,Deborah Richards*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了一种基于面部微动态分析的被动式痴呆筛查方法，通过分析眨眼动态、嘴部运动、注视变化和头部微调等面部运动特征，无需语言或文字即可进行早期神经认知变化检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有痴呆筛查方法依赖语音或脚本访谈，限制了在临床外的应用，且预测结果与语言和转录紧密耦合。本研究旨在开发一种不依赖语言、可在自然环境中大规模应用的被动筛查方法。

Method: 通过稳定面部信号，将微小的面部运动转换为可解释的微动态时间序列，平滑处理后将短窗口汇总为紧凑的片段级统计量。分析运动在各通道的分布而非幅度，使每通道效应透明化。

Result: 在YT DemTalk数据集上，消融实验发现注视不稳定性和嘴部/下颌动态是最具信息量的线索，轻量级分类器可获得AUROC 0.953、AP 0.961、F1分数0.851和准确率0.857的痴呆预测性能。

Conclusion: 面部时间微动态分析为语言无关的痴呆筛查提供了有效方法，能够在自然环境中进行大规模被动检测，且不依赖设备、话题或文化背景。

Abstract: We target passive dementia screening from short camera-facing talking head video, developing a facial temporal micro dynamics analysis for language free detection of early neuro cognitive change. This enables unscripted, in the wild video analysis at scale to capture natural facial behaviors, transferrable across devices, topics, and cultures without active intervention by clinicians or researchers during recording. Most existing resources prioritize speech or scripted interviews, limiting use outside clinics and coupling predictions to language and transcription. In contrast, we identify and analyze whether temporal facial kinematics, including blink dynamics, small mouth jaw motions, gaze variability, and subtle head adjustments, are sufficient for dementia screening without speech or text. By stabilizing facial signals, we convert these micro movements into interpretable facial microdynamic time series, smooth them, and summarize short windows into compact clip level statistics for screening. Each window is encoded by its activity mix (the relative share of motion across streams), thus the predictor analyzes the distribution of motion across streams rather than its magnitude, making per channel effects transparent. We also introduce YT DemTalk, a new dataset curated from publicly available, in the wild camera facing videos. It contains 300 clips (150 with self reported dementia, 150 controls) to test our model and offer a first benchmarking of the corpus. On YT DemTalk, ablations identify gaze lability and mouth/jaw dynamics as the most informative cues, and light weighted shallow classifiers could attain a dementia prediction performance of (AUROC) 0.953, 0.961 Average Precision (AP), 0.851 F1-score, and 0.857 accuracy.

### [10] [Can World Simulators Reason? Gen-ViRe: A Generative Visual Reasoning Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13853)
*Xinxin Liu,Zhaopan Xu,Kai Wang,Yong Jae Lee,Yuzhang Shang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gen-ViRe是一个新的视觉推理基准测试框架，用于评估视频生成模型在连续帧推理中的认知能力，填补了现有基准在评估多步规划、算法逻辑和抽象模式推断方面的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成基准主要关注保真度或对齐性，无法评估Chain-of-Frames推理的核心认知能力，这阻碍了对模型能力的系统理解和改进指导。

Method: 基于认知科学和实际AI应用，将CoF推理分解为六个认知维度和24个子任务，通过多源数据整理、最小提示协议和混合VLM辅助评估进行定量评估。

Result: 在SOTA系统上的实验揭示了视觉质量与推理深度之间的显著差异，为真正世界模拟器的发展建立了基准和诊断工具。

Conclusion: Gen-ViRe提供了首个对视频模型作为推理器的定量评估，揭示了当前模型在推理能力方面的局限性，为开发更强大的世界模拟器提供了指导。

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enables sophisticated symbolic reasoning in LLMs, it remains confined to discrete text and cannot simulate the continuous, physics-governed dynamics of the real world. Recent video generation models have emerged as potential world simulators through Chain-of-Frames (CoF) reasoning -- materializing thought as frame-by-frame visual sequences, with each frame representing a physically-grounded reasoning step. Despite compelling demonstrations, a challenge persists: existing benchmarks, focusing on fidelity or alignment, do not assess CoF reasoning and thus cannot measure core cognitive abilities in multi-step planning, algorithmic logic, or abstract pattern extrapolation. This evaluation void prevents systematic understanding of model capabilities and principled guidance for improvement. We introduce Gen-ViRe (Generative Visual Reasoning Benchmark), a framework grounded in cognitive science and real-world AI applications, which decomposes CoF reasoning into six cognitive dimensions -- from perceptual logic to abstract planning -- and 24 subtasks. Through multi-source data curation, minimal prompting protocols, and hybrid VLM-assisted evaluation with detailed criteria, Gen-ViRe delivers the first quantitative assessment of video models as reasoners. Our experiments on SOTA systems reveal substantial discrepancies between impressive visual quality and actual reasoning depth, establishing baselines and diagnostic tools to advance genuine world simulators.

### [11] [RSPose: Ranking Based Losses for Human Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13857)
*Muhammed Can Keles,Bedrettin Cetinkaya,Sinan Kalkan,Emre Akbas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出基于排序的损失函数来解决热图式人体姿态估计中的三个主要问题：MSE损失不能有效提升关节定位精度、热图的空间和类别不平衡、以及评估指标与损失函数之间的不一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的热图式人体姿态估计方法存在三个核心问题：(1) MSE损失对所有像素偏差同等惩罚，无法有效提升关节定位精度；(2) 热图存在空间和类别不平衡；(3) 评估指标(mAP)与损失函数之间存在差异。

Method: 提出基于排序的损失函数，通过理论分析和实证研究证明这些损失优于常用的热图损失(MSE、KL散度)。该方法提高了置信度分数与定位质量之间的相关性，从而在NMS过程中实现更准确的实例选择。

Result: 在三个数据集(COCO、CrowdPose、MPII)上验证了RSPose的有效性。使用ViTPose-H在COCO-val集上达到79.9 mAP，超越之前最优结果。同时将SimCC Resnet-50在COCO-val集上的性能提升了1.5 AP，达到73.6 AP。

Conclusion: RSPose是首个提出与评估指标(mAP)对齐的损失函数的人体姿态估计方法，通过基于排序的损失有效解决了热图式方法的三个核心问题，在各种数据集和模型上都取得了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: While heatmap-based human pose estimation methods have shown strong performance, they suffer from three main problems: (P1) "Commonly used Mean Squared Error (MSE)" Loss may not always improve joint localization because it penalizes all pixel deviations equally, without focusing explicitly on sharpening and correctly localizing the peak corresponding to the joint; (P2) heatmaps are spatially and class-wise imbalanced; and, (P3) there is a discrepancy between the evaluation metric (i.e., mAP) and the loss functions.
  We propose ranking-based losses to address these issues.
  Both theoretically and empirically, we show that our proposed losses are superior to commonly used heatmap losses (MSE, KL-Divergence). Our losses considerably increase the correlation between confidence scores and localization qualities, which is desirable because higher correlation leads to more accurate instance selection during Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and better Average Precision (mAP) performance. We refer to the models trained with our losses as RSPose.
  We show the effectiveness of RSPose across two different modes: one-dimensional and two-dimensional heatmaps, on three different datasets (COCO, CrowdPose, MPII).
  To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose losses that align with the evaluation metric (mAP) for human pose estimation.
  RSPose outperforms the previous state of the art on the COCO-val set and achieves an mAP score of 79.9 with ViTPose-H, a vision transformer model for human pose estimation.
  We also improve SimCC Resnet-50, a coordinate classification-based pose estimation method, by 1.5 AP on the COCO-val set, achieving 73.6 AP.

### [12] [Segmenting Collision Sound Sources in Egocentric Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13863)
*Kranti Kumar Parida,Omar Emara,Hazel Doughty,Dima Damen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出碰撞声源分割任务CS3，从碰撞声音中识别并分割视频中产生声音的物体，使用弱监督方法和基础模型，在EPIC-CS3和Ego4D-CS3基准上性能提升显著


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类多感官感知能力启发，希望从碰撞声音中识别产生声音的物体，特别是在第一人称视角视频中，声音清晰但视觉场景复杂、物体小、交互短暂

Method: 使用弱监督的音频条件分割方法，结合基础模型CLIP和SAM2，并融入第一人称视角线索（如手中物体）来识别可能的碰撞声源

Result: 在两个新基准EPIC-CS3和Ego4D-CS3上，mIoU分别比竞争基线方法提升3倍和4.7倍

Conclusion: 提出的CS3任务和方法有效解决了从碰撞声音中分割视觉声源的挑战，在第一人称视频中表现出色

Abstract: Humans excel at multisensory perception and can often recognise object properties from the sound of their interactions. Inspired by this, we propose the novel task of Collision Sound Source Segmentation (CS3), where we aim to segment the objects responsible for a collision sound in visual input (i.e. video frames from the collision clip), conditioned on the audio. This task presents unique challenges. Unlike isolated sound events, a collision sound arises from interactions between two objects, and the acoustic signature of the collision depends on both. We focus on egocentric video, where sounds are often clear, but the visual scene is cluttered, objects are small, and interactions are brief.
  To address these challenges, we propose a weakly-supervised method for audio-conditioned segmentation, utilising foundation models (CLIP and SAM2). We also incorporate egocentric cues, i.e. objects in hands, to find acting objects that can potentially be collision sound sources. Our approach outperforms competitive baselines by $3\times$ and $4.7\times$ in mIoU on two benchmarks we introduce for the CS3 task: EPIC-CS3 and Ego4D-CS3.

*Changyang Li,Xuejian Ma,Lixiang Liu,Zhan Li,Qingan Yan,Yi Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出几何表示回归(GRR)方法，通过预测解耦的几何表示来估计相机位姿，替代传统的绝对位姿回归(APR)黑盒方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统APR方法直接回归6自由度位姿，容易记忆训练视图而非理解3D场景几何，需要更几何基础的方法

Method: 将APR重新表述为逆向渲染过程，预测解耦的几何表示：光线束方向估计旋转，对应点图估计平移，通过可微分求解器恢复最终位姿

Result: 在7-Scenes和Cambridge Landmarks数据集上达到最先进性能

Conclusion: 建模逆向渲染过程是实现可泛化绝对位姿估计的更鲁棒路径

Abstract: Absolute Pose Regression (APR) has emerged as a compelling paradigm for visual localization. However, APR models typically operate as black boxes, directly regressing a 6-DoF pose from a query image, which can lead to memorizing training views rather than understanding 3D scene geometry. In this work, we propose a geometrically-grounded alternative. Inspired by novel view synthesis, which renders images from intermediate geometric representations, we reformulate APR as its inverse that regresses the underlying 3D representations directly from the image, and we name this paradigm Geometric Representation Regression (GRR). Our model explicitly predicts two disentangled geometric representations in the world coordinate system: (1) a ray bundle's directions to estimate camera rotation, and (2) a corresponding pointmap to estimate camera translation. The final 6-DoF camera pose is then recovered from these geometric components using a differentiable deterministic solver. This disentangled approach, which separates the learned visual-to-geometry mapping from the final pose calculation, introduces a strong geometric prior into the network. We find that the explicit decoupling of rotation and translation predictions measurably boosts performance. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on 7-Scenes and Cambridge Landmarks datasets, validating that modeling the inverse rendering process is a more robust path toward generalizable absolute pose estimation.

Abstract: Bladder cancer is one of the most prevalent malignancies worldwide, with a recurrence rate of up to 78%, necessitating accurate post-operative monitoring for effective patient management. Multi-sequence contrast-enhanced MRI is commonly used for recurrence detection; however, interpreting these scans remains challenging, even for experienced radiologists, due to post-surgical alterations such as scarring, swelling, and tissue remodeling. AI-assisted diagnostic tools have shown promise in improving bladder cancer recurrence prediction, yet progress in this field is hindered by the lack of dedicated multi-sequence MRI datasets for recurrence assessment study. In this work, we first introduce a curated multi-sequence, multi-modal MRI dataset specifically designed for bladder cancer recurrence prediction, establishing a valuable benchmark for future research. We then propose H-CNN-ViT, a new Hierarchical Gated Attention Multi-Branch model that enables selective weighting of features from the global (ViT) and local (CNN) paths based on contextual demands, achieving a balanced and targeted feature fusion. Our multi-branch architecture processes each modality independently, ensuring that the unique properties of each imaging channel are optimally captured and integrated. Evaluated on our dataset, H-CNN-ViT achieves an AUC of 78.6%, surpassing state-of-the-art models. Our model is publicly available at https://github.com/XLIAaron/H-CNN-ViT}.

Conclusion: QwenCLIP通过LLM增强的文本编码有效解决了长医学报告表示问题，为医学视觉-语言任务提供了更强大的基础模型

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has demonstrated strong generalization for vision-language tasks in computer vision and medical domains, yet its text encoder accepts only up to 77 tokens, which limits its ability to represent long and information-rich radiology reports. Recent adaptations using domain-specific encoders, such as PubMedBERT or ClinicalBERT, mitigate this issue by leveraging medical corpora, but remain constrained by their limited input length (typically 512 tokens) and relatively shallow semantic understanding. To address these limitations, we propose QwenCLIP, a vision-language framework that replaces CLIP's text encoder with a large language model (LLM)-based embedding module (e.g., Qwen3-Embedding) and introduces learnable prompts to enhance cross-modal alignment. By leveraging the extended context window and richer representations of LLMs, QwenCLIP captures comprehensive medical semantics from long-form clinical text, substantially improving medical image-text alignment and downstream performance on radiology benchmarks. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Wxy-24/QwenCLIP.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new enhanced model architecture to perform classification of lumbar spine degeneration with DICOM images while using a hybrid approach, integrating EfficientNet and VGG19 together with custom-designed components. The proposed model is differentiated from traditional transfer learning methods as it incorporates a Pseudo-Newton Boosting layer along with a Sparsity-Induced Feature Reduction Layer that forms a multi-tiered framework, further improving feature selection and representation. The Pseudo-Newton Boosting layer makes smart variations of feature weights, with more detailed anatomical features, which are mostly left out in a transfer learning setup. In addition, the Sparsity-Induced Layer removes redundancy for learned features, producing lean yet robust representations for pathology in the lumbar spine. This architecture is novel as it overcomes the constraints in the traditional transfer learning approach, especially in the high-dimensional context of medical images, and achieves a significant performance boost, reaching a precision of 0.9, recall of 0.861, F1 score of 0.88, loss of 0.18, and an accuracy of 88.1%, compared to the baseline model, EfficientNet. This work will present the architectures, preprocessing pipeline, and experimental results. The results contribute to the development of automated diagnostic tools for medical images.

Abstract: Recent advancements in autonomous driving (AD) have explored the use of vision-language models (VLMs) within visual question answering (VQA) frameworks for direct driving decision-making. However, these approaches often depend on handcrafted prompts and suffer from inconsistent performance, limiting their robustness and generalization in real-world scenarios. In this work, we evaluate state-of-the-art open-source VLMs on high-level decision-making tasks using ego-view visual inputs and identify critical limitations in their ability to deliver reliable, context-aware decisions. Motivated by these observations, we propose a new approach that shifts the role of VLMs from direct decision generators to semantic enhancers. Specifically, we leverage their strong general scene understanding to enrich existing vision-based benchmarks with structured, linguistically rich scene descriptions. Building on this enriched representation, we introduce a multi-modal interactive architecture that fuses visual and linguistic features for more accurate decision-making and interpretable textual explanations. Furthermore, we design a post-hoc refinement module that utilizes VLMs to enhance prediction reliability. Extensive experiments on two autonomous driving benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, offering a promising direction for integrating VLMs into reliable and interpretable AD systems.

Abstract: The population loss of trained deep neural networks often exhibits power law scaling with the size of the training dataset, guiding significant performance advancements in deep learning applications. In this study, we focus on the scaling relationship with data size in the context of medical anatomical segmentation, a domain that remains underexplored. We analyze scaling laws for anatomical segmentation across 15 semantic tasks and 4 imaging modalities, demonstrating that larger datasets significantly improve segmentation performance, following similar scaling trends. Motivated by the topological isomorphism in images sharing anatomical structures, we evaluate the impact of deformation-guided augmentation strategies on data scaling laws, specifically random elastic deformation and registration-guided deformation. We also propose a novel, scalable image augmentation approach that generates diffeomorphic mappings from geodesic subspace based on image registration to introduce realistic deformation. Our experimental results demonstrate that both registered and generated deformation-based augmentation considerably enhance data utilization efficiency. The proposed generated deformation method notably achieves superior performance and accelerated convergence, surpassing standard power law scaling trends without requiring additional data. Overall, this work provides insights into the understanding of segmentation scalability and topological variation impact in medical imaging, thereby leading to more efficient model development with reduced annotation and computational costs.

Motivation: 现有数字血液病理学方法（包括单任务、视觉语言、WSI优化和单细胞血液学模型）无法提供统一的、多任务、多模态的跨复杂疾病推理能力。

Method: 基于Hema-Former多模态模块构建，在46个公开数据集（包含70万+图像和2.1万+问答对）上训练，在层次级别桥接视觉和文本表示，支持不同粒度的多种任务。

Conclusion: 该框架为多任务多模态数字血液病理学设立了新标准，代码将公开。

Abstract: Digital hematopathology requires cell-level analysis across diverse disease categories, including malignant disorders (e.g., leukemia), infectious conditions (e.g., malaria), and non-malignant red blood cell disorders (e.g., sickle cell disease). Whether single-task, vision-language, WSI-optimized, or single-cell hematology models, these approaches share a key limitation, they cannot provide unified, multi-task, multi-modal reasoning across the complexities of digital hematopathology. To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni-Hema, a multi-task, unified model for digital hematopathology integrating detection, classification, segmentation, morphology prediction, and reasoning across multiple diseases. Uni-Hema leverages 46 publicly available datasets, encompassing over 700K images and 21K question-answer pairs, and is built upon Hema-Former, a multimodal module that bridges visual and textual representations at the hierarchy level for the different tasks (detection, classification, segmentation, morphology, mask language modeling and visual question answer) at different granularity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Uni-Hema achieves comparable or superior performance to train on a single-task and single dataset models, across diverse hematological tasks, while providing interpretable, morphologically relevant insights at the single-cell level. Our framework establishes a new standard for multi-task and multi-modal digital hematopathology. The code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Among soil erosion problems, Ephemeral Gullies are one of the most concerning phenomena occurring in agricultural fields. Their short temporal cycles increase the difficulty in automatically detecting them using classical computer vision approaches and remote sensing. Also, due to scarcity of and the difficulty in producing accurate labeled data, automatic detection of ephemeral gullies using Machine Learning is limited to zero-shot approaches which are hard to implement. To overcome these challenges, we present the first weakly supervised pipeline for detection of ephemeral gullies. Our method relies on remote sensing and uses Vision Language Models (VLMs) to drastically reduce the labor-intensive task of manual labeling. In order to achieve that, the method exploits: 1) the knowledge embedded in the VLM's pretraining; 2) a teacher-student model where the teacher learns from noisy labels coming from the VLMs, and the student learns by weak supervision using teacher-generate labels and a noise-aware loss function. We also make available the first-of-its-kind dataset for semi-supervised detection of ephemeral gully from remote-sensed images. The dataset consists of a number of locations labeled by a group of soil and plant scientists, as well as a large number of unlabeled locations. The dataset represent more than 18,000 high-resolution remote-sensing images obtained over the course of 13 years. Our experimental results demonstrate the validity of our approach by showing superior performances compared to VLMs and the label model itself when using weak supervision to train an student model. The code and dataset for this work are made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成视频模型在时间真实性方面存在弱点，大多数评估指标主要关注空间外观，对运动的敏感性有限。

Method: 使用从压缩视频流中提取的运动矢量作为轻量级、分辨率一致的运动动态描述符，通过计算真实视频和生成视频MV统计之间的KL、JS和Wasserstein散度来量化真实性。

Result: 实验显示生成视频与真实视频在运动模式上存在系统性差异，Pika和SVD在熵基散度上最接近真实视频，VC2和Text2Video-Zero在MV-sum统计上表现最佳，CogVideo在所有指标上偏差最大。MV-RGB融合显著提高了下游分类任务的准确性。

Conclusion: 压缩域运动矢量为诊断生成视频运动缺陷和增强判别模型的时间推理提供了有效的时序信号。

Abstract: Temporal realism remains a central weakness of current generative video models, as most evaluation metrics prioritize spatial appearance and offer limited sensitivity to motion. We introduce a scalable, model-agnostic framework that assesses temporal behavior using motion vectors (MVs) extracted directly from compressed video streams. Codec-generated MVs from standards such as H.264 and HEVC provide lightweight, resolution-consistent descriptors of motion dynamics. We quantify realism by computing Kullback-Leibler, Jensen-Shannon, and Wasserstein divergences between MV statistics of real and generated videos. Experiments on the GenVidBench dataset containing videos from eight state-of-the-art generators reveal systematic discrepancies from real motion: entropy-based divergences rank Pika and SVD as closest to real videos, MV-sum statistics favor VC2 and Text2Video-Zero, and CogVideo shows the largest deviations across both measures. Visualizations of MV fields and class-conditional motion heatmaps further reveal center bias, sparse and piecewise constant flows, and grid-like artifacts that frame-level metrics do not capture. Beyond evaluation, we investigate MV-RGB fusion through channel concatenation, cross-attention, joint embedding, and a motion-aware fusion module. Incorporating MVs improves downstream classification across ResNet, I3D, and TSN backbones, with ResNet-18 and ResNet-34 reaching up to 97.4% accuracy and I3D achieving 99.0% accuracy on real-versus-generated discrimination. These findings demonstrate that compressed-domain MVs provide an effective temporal signal for diagnosing motion defects in generative videos and for strengthening temporal reasoning in discriminative models.

Conclusion: 这是首个适用于城市规模部署的可扩展实时MCVT框架，解决了现有方法在实时性和可扩展性方面的不足。

Abstract: In modern Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), cameras are a key component due to their ability to provide valuable information for multiple stakeholders. A central task is Multi-Camera Vehicle Tracking (MCVT), which generates vehicle trajectories and enables applications such as anomaly detection, traffic density estimation, and suspect vehicle tracking. However, most existing studies on MCVT emphasize accuracy while overlooking real-time performance and scalability. These two aspects are essential for real-world deployment and become increasingly challenging in city-scale applications as the number of cameras grows. To address this issue, we propose SAE-MCVT, the first scalable real-time MCVT framework. The system includes several edge devices that interact with one central workstation separately. On the edge side, live RTSP video streams are serialized and processed through modules including object detection, object tracking, geo-mapping, and feature extraction. Only lightweight metadata -- vehicle locations and deep appearance features -- are transmitted to the central workstation. On the central side, cross-camera association is calculated under the constraint of spatial-temporal relations between adjacent cameras, which are learned through a self-supervised camera link model. Experiments on the RoundaboutHD dataset show that SAE-MCVT maintains real-time operation on 2K 15 FPS video streams and achieves an IDF1 score of 61.2. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first scalable real-time MCVT framework suitable for city-scale deployment.

Abstract: Following road safety norms is non-negotiable not only for humans but also for the AI systems that govern autonomous vehicles. In this work, we evaluate how well multi-modal large language models (LLMs) understand road safety concepts, specifically through schematic and illustrative representations. We curate a pilot dataset of images depicting traffic signs and road-safety norms sourced from school text books and use it to evaluate models capabilities in a zero-shot setting. Our preliminary results show that these models struggle with safety reasoning and reveal gaps between human learning and model interpretation. We further provide an analysis of these performance gaps for future research.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has recently shown significant promise across various NLP and computer vision tasks by explicitly generating intermediate reasoning steps. However, we find that reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuned CoT reasoning can paradoxically degrade performance in Visual Grounding tasks, particularly as CoT outputs become lengthy or complex. Additionally, our analysis reveals that increased dataset size does not always enhance performance due to varying data complexities. Motivated by these findings, we propose Curriculum-based Relative Policy Optimization (CuRPO), a novel training strategy that leverages CoT length and generalized Intersection over Union (gIoU) rewards as complexity indicators to progressively structure training data from simpler to more challenging examples. Extensive experiments on RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and LISA datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. CuRPO consistently outperforms existing methods, including Visual-RFT, with notable improvements of up to +12.52 mAP on RefCOCO. Moreover, CuRPO exhibits exceptional efficiency and robustness, delivering strong localization performance even in few-shot learning scenarios, particularly benefiting tasks characterized by ambiguous and intricate textual descriptions.The code is released on https://github.com/qyoung-yan/CuRPO.

Result: 仅用1%训练预算的程序生成数据就能在ImageNet-1k上提升1.7%准确率，效果相当于28%的ImageNet数据

Conclusion: 这种方法为数据高效和领域无关的预训练策略提供了有前景的新路径

Abstract: Transformers show remarkable versatility across domains, suggesting the existence of inductive biases beneficial across modalities. In this work, we explore a new way to instil such generic biases in vision transformers (ViTs) by pretraining on procedurally-generated data devoid of visual or semantic content. We generate this data with simple algorithms such as formal grammars, so the results bear no relationship to either natural or synthetic images. We use this procedurally-generated data to pretrain ViTs in a warm-up phase that bypasses their visual patch embedding mechanisms, thus encouraging the models to internalise abstract computational priors. When followed by standard image-based training, this warm-up significantly improves data efficiency, convergence speed, and downstream performance. On ImageNet-1k for example, allocating just 1% of the training budget to procedural data improves final accuracy by over 1.7%. In terms of its effect on performance, 1% procedurally generated data is thus equivalent to 28% of the ImageNet-1k data. These findings suggest a promising path toward new data-efficient and domain-agnostic pretraining strategies.

Abstract: We investigate image segmentation of cells under the lens of scalar fields. Our goal is to learn a continuous scalar field on image domains such that its segmentation produces robust instances for cells present in images. This field is a function parameterized by the trained network, and its segmentation is realized by the watershed method. The fields we experiment with are solutions to the Poisson partial differential equation and a diffusion mimicking the steady-state solution of the heat equation. These solutions are obtained by minimizing just the field residuals, no regularization is needed, providing a robust regression capable of diminishing the adverse impacts of outliers in the training data and allowing for sharp cell boundaries. A single tensor is all that is needed to train a \unet\ thus simplifying implementation, lowering training and inference times, hence reducing energy consumption, and requiring a small memory footprint, all attractive features in edge computing. We present competitive results on public datasets from the literature and show that our novel, simple yet geometrically insightful approach can achieve excellent cell segmentation results.

### [29] [Learning Skill-Attributes for Transferable Assessment in Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13993)
*Kumar Ashutosh,Kristen Grauman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CrossTrainer方法，通过发现跨运动项目的技能属性（如平衡、控制、手部位置），训练多模态语言模型为运动视频生成可操作的反馈和熟练度评级，实现跨运动项目的技能评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型局限于单一运动项目，且专家级监督成本高、稀缺，难以覆盖众多运动项目。需要开发可迁移的视频表示方法来解决这一挑战。

Method: CrossTrainer方法发现跨运动边界的技能属性，训练多模态语言模型生成针对新视频的可操作反馈和熟练度评级。

Result: 在跨运动和同运动设置下的多个数据集上验证，相对现有技术提升高达60%。通过抽象出指示人类技能的共享行为，视频表示比现有技术泛化能力显著更好。

Conclusion: 通过抽象人类技能的共享行为，提出的视频表示方法显著优于现有技术，丰富了当今多模态大语言模型的能力。

Abstract: Skill assessment from video entails rating the quality of a person's physical performance and explaining what could be done better. Today's models specialize for an individual sport, and suffer from the high cost and scarcity of expert-level supervision across the long tail of sports. Towards closing that gap, we explore transferable video representations for skill assessment. Our CrossTrainer approach discovers skill-attributes, such as balance, control, and hand positioning -- whose meaning transcends the boundaries of any given sport, then trains a multimodal language model to generate actionable feedback for a novel video, e.g., "lift hands more to generate more power" as well as its proficiency level, e.g., early expert. We validate the new model on multiple datasets for both cross-sport (transfer) and intra-sport (in-domain) settings, where it achieves gains up to 60% relative to the state of the art. By abstracting out the shared behaviors indicative of human skill, the proposed video representation generalizes substantially better than an array of existing techniques, enriching today's multimodal large language models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于卷积字典特征解耦的双提示专家网络CD-DPE，用于多对比度MRI超分辨率重建，通过分离跨对比度和对比度内特征来减少冗余和干扰，并使用频率提示和自适应路由提示优化特征融合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多对比度MRI超分辨率重建面临对比度差异带来的挑战，难以有效利用参考图像纹理指导目标图像重建，导致特征整合不理想。

Method: 采用迭代卷积字典特征解耦模块分离特征，结合双提示特征融合专家模块，使用频率提示选择相关参考特征，自适应路由提示确定最佳融合方法。

Result: 在公共多对比度MRI数据集上表现优于现有方法，在未见数据集上展现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: CD-DPE方法能有效提升多对比度MRI超分辨率重建质量，具有良好泛化性能。

Abstract: Multi-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) super-resolution intends to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) images from low-resolution (LR) scans by leveraging structural information present in HR reference images acquired with different contrasts. This technique enhances anatomical detail and soft tissue differentiation, which is vital for early diagnosis and clinical decision-making. However, inherent contrasts disparities between modalities pose fundamental challenges in effectively utilizing reference image textures to guide target image reconstruction, often resulting in suboptimal feature integration. To address this issue, we propose a dual-prompt expert network based on a convolutional dictionary feature decoupling (CD-DPE) strategy for multi-contrast MRI super-resolution. Specifically, we introduce an iterative convolutional dictionary feature decoupling module (CD-FDM) to separate features into cross-contrast and intra-contrast components, thereby reducing redundancy and interference. To fully integrate these features, a novel dual-prompt feature fusion expert module (DP-FFEM) is proposed. This module uses a frequency prompt to guide the selection of relevant reference features for incorporation into the target image, while an adaptive routing prompt determines the optimal method for fusing reference and target features to enhance reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments on public multi-contrast MRI datasets demonstrate that CD-DPE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstructing fine details. Additionally, experiments on unseen datasets demonstrated that CD-DPE exhibits strong generalization capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RISE是首个基于单静态雷达的室内场景理解基准系统，通过利用多径反射的几何线索，实现了布局重建和物体检测，在保护隐私的同时解决了传统光学传感器在室内环境中的遮挡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决室内场景理解中光学传感器的遮挡问题和隐私风险，同时利用毫米波雷达的隐私保护和穿透能力，但需要克服其低空间分辨率带来的几何推理困难。

Method: 提出双角度多径增强方法，显式建模到达角和离开角来恢复次级反射；采用模拟到现实的分层扩散框架，将碎片化的雷达响应转换为完整的布局重建和物体检测。

Result: 在布局重建方面，将Chamfer距离降低了60%（降至16厘米）；在物体检测方面，实现了58%的IoU，是首个基于毫米波雷达的物体检测方法。

Conclusion: RISE为使用单静态雷达进行几何感知和隐私保护的室内场景理解建立了新的基础。

Abstract: Robust and privacy-preserving indoor scene understanding remains a fundamental open problem. While optical sensors such as RGB and LiDAR offer high spatial fidelity, they suffer from severe occlusions and introduce privacy risks in indoor environments. In contrast, millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar preserves privacy and penetrates obstacles, but its inherently low spatial resolution makes reliable geometric reasoning difficult.
  We introduce RISE, the first benchmark and system for single-static-radar indoor scene understanding, jointly targeting layout reconstruction and object detection. RISE is built upon the key insight that multipath reflections, traditionally treated as noise, encode rich geometric cues. To exploit this, we propose a Bi-Angular Multipath Enhancement that explicitly models Angle-of-Arrival and Angle-of-Departure to recover secondary (ghost) reflections and reveal invisible structures. On top of these enhanced observations, a simulation-to-reality Hierarchical Diffusion framework transforms fragmented radar responses into complete layout reconstruction and object detection.
  Our benchmark contains 50,000 frames collected across 100 real indoor trajectories, forming the first large-scale dataset dedicated to radar-based indoor scene understanding. Extensive experiments show that RISE reduces the Chamfer Distance by 60% (down to 16 cm) compared to the state of the art in layout reconstruction, and delivers the first mmWave-based object detection, achieving 58% IoU. These results establish RISE as a new foundation for geometry-aware and privacy-preserving indoor scene understanding using a single static radar.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类可以轻松识别MRI图像的解剖平面方向，但自动化系统难以完成此任务。缺少平面方向元数据会复杂化分析、增加异构数据集合并时的域偏移，并降低诊断分类器的准确性。

Conclusion: 2.5D上下文对于MRI平面方向识别至关重要，开发的模型显著提高了识别准确率，并在下游诊断任务中验证了其有效性。模型已集成到交互式Web应用中并开源提供。

Abstract: Humans can easily identify anatomical planes (axial, coronal, and sagittal) on a 2D MRI slice, but automated systems struggle with this task. Missing plane orientation metadata can complicate analysis, increase domain shift when merging heterogeneous datasets, and reduce accuracy of diagnostic classifiers. This study develops a classifier that accurately generates plane orientation metadata. We adopt a 2.5D context-aware model that leverages multi-slice information to avoid ambiguity from isolated slices and enable robust feature learning. We train the 2.5D model on both 3D slice sequences and static 2D images. While our 2D reference model achieves 98.74% accuracy, our 2.5D method raises this to 99.49%, reducing errors by 60%, highlighting the importance of 2.5D context. We validate the utility of our generated metadata in a brain tumor detection task. A gated strategy selectively uses metadata-enhanced predictions based on uncertainty scores, boosting accuracy from 97.0% with an image-only model to 98.0%, reducing misdiagnoses by 33.3%. We integrate our plane orientation model into an interactive web application and provide it open-source.

TL;DR: LINGUAL是一个通过自然语言指令驱动的主动学习框架，能够将专家指令转换为可执行程序，自动完成医学图像分割任务，显著减少人工标注时间约80%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主动学习在医学图像分割中面临边界模糊、标注劳动强度大且认知要求高的问题，需要更高效的方式来减少专家标注负担。

Method: 通过上下文学习将自然语言指令翻译成可执行程序，自动执行相应的子任务序列，无需人工干预。

Result: 在主动域适应任务中达到或超过传统主动学习基线性能，同时估计标注时间减少约80%。

Conclusion: 语言指导为医学图像分割提供了一种有效的替代方案，能够显著降低专家标注负担，同时保持高性能。

Abstract: Although active learning (AL) in segmentation tasks enables experts to annotate selected regions of interest (ROIs) instead of entire images, it remains highly challenging, labor-intensive, and cognitively demanding due to the blurry and ambiguous boundaries commonly observed in medical images. Also, in conventional AL, annotation effort is a function of the ROI- larger regions make the task cognitively easier but incur higher annotation costs, whereas smaller regions demand finer precision and more attention from the expert. In this context, language guidance provides an effective alternative, requiring minimal expert effort while bypassing the cognitively demanding task of precise boundary delineation in segmentation. Towards this goal, we introduce LINGUAL: a framework that receives natural language instructions from an expert, translates them into executable programs through in-context learning, and automatically performs the corresponding sequence of sub-tasks without any human intervention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LINGUAL in active domain adaptation (ADA) achieving comparable or superior performance to AL baselines while reducing estimated annotation time by approximately 80%.

Motivation: 随着视觉生成模型的快速发展，AI生成图像检测变得至关重要。传统方法需要针对特定数据集训练检测器，本研究探索无需训练的方法，利用自监督模型而无需先验数据知识。

Method: 基于自监督模型对RandomResizedCrop等增强的鲁棒性，定义基础评分函数量化图像嵌入对Haar小波分解提取的高频方向扰动的敏感性。通过将图像缩放到模型输入尺寸的倍数，分割成小块并计算每个块的基础评分，最终取平均得到检测分数。

Conclusion: WaRPAD是一种有效的无需训练AI生成图像检测方法，由于RandomResizedCrop不变性是自监督模型的常见训练方案，该方法可跨不同自监督模型应用。

Abstract: AI-generated image detection has become crucial with the rapid advancement of vision-generative models. Instead of training detectors tailored to specific datasets, we study a training-free approach leveraging self-supervised models without requiring prior data knowledge. These models, pre-trained with augmentations like RandomResizedCrop, learn to produce consistent representations across varying resolutions. Motivated by this, we propose WaRPAD, a training-free AI-generated image detection algorithm based on self-supervised models. Since neighborhood pixel differences in images are highly sensitive to resizing operations, WaRPAD first defines a base score function that quantifies the sensitivity of image embeddings to perturbations along high-frequency directions extracted via Haar wavelet decomposition. To simulate robustness against cropping augmentation, we rescale each image to a multiple of the models input size, divide it into smaller patches, and compute the base score for each patch. The final detection score is then obtained by averaging the scores across all patches. We validate WaRPAD on real datasets of diverse resolutions and domains, and images generated by 23 different generative models. Our method consistently achieves competitive performance and demonstrates strong robustness to test-time corruptions. Furthermore, as invariance to RandomResizedCrop is a common training scheme across self-supervised models, we show that WaRPAD is applicable across self-supervised models.

Abstract: Garment-centric fashion image generation aims to synthesize realistic and controllable human models dressing a given garment, which has attracted growing interest due to its practical applications in e-commerce. The key challenges of the task lie in two aspects: (1) faithfully preserving the garment details, and (2) gaining fine-grained controllability over the model's appearance. Existing methods typically require performing garment deformation in the generation process, which often leads to garment texture distortions. Also, they fail to control the fine-grained attributes of the generated models, due to the lack of specifically designed mechanisms. To address these issues, we propose FashionMAC, a novel diffusion-based deformation-free framework that achieves high-quality and controllable fashion showcase image generation. The core idea of our framework is to eliminate the need for performing garment deformation and directly outpaint the garment segmented from a dressed person, which enables faithful preservation of the intricate garment details. Moreover, we propose a novel region-adaptive decoupled attention (RADA) mechanism along with a chained mask injection strategy to achieve fine-grained appearance controllability over the synthesized human models. Specifically, RADA adaptively predicts the generated regions for each fine-grained text attribute and enforces the text attribute to focus on the predicted regions by a chained mask injection strategy, significantly enhancing the visual fidelity and the controllability. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance of our framework compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Flood prediction is critical for emergency planning and response to mitigate human and economic losses. Traditional physics-based hydrodynamic models generate high-resolution flood maps using numerical methods requiring fine-grid discretization; which are computationally intensive and impractical for real-time large-scale applications. While recent studies have applied convolutional neural networks for flood map super-resolution with good accuracy and speed, they suffer from limited generalizability to unseen areas. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages latent diffusion models to perform super-resolution on coarse-grid flood maps, with the objective of achieving the accuracy of fine-grid flood maps while significantly reducing inference time. Experimental results demonstrate that latent diffusion models substantially decrease the computational time required to produce high-fidelity flood maps without compromising on accuracy, enabling their use in real-time flood risk management. Moreover, diffusion models exhibit superior generalizability across different physical locations, with transfer learning further accelerating adaptation to new geographic regions. Our approach also incorporates physics-informed inputs, addressing the common limitation of black-box behavior in machine learning, thereby enhancing interpretability.

Abstract: Anomaly object detection and classification are one of the main challenging tasks in computer vision and pattern recognition. In this paper, we propose a new method to automatically detect, localize and classify defects in concrete bridge structures using drone imagery. This framework is constituted of two main stages. The first stage uses saliency for defect region proposals where defects often exhibit local discontinuities in the normal surface patterns with regard to their surrounding. The second stage employs a YOLOX-based deep learning detector that operates on saliency-enhanced images obtained by applying bounding-box level brightness augmentation to salient defect regions. Experimental results on standard datasets confirm the performance of our framework and its suitability in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency, which give a huge potential to be implemented in a self-powered inspection system.

Result: SCAR在指令编辑和可控生成基准测试中实现了卓越的视觉保真度和语义对齐，优于先前的基于自回归的方法，同时保持可控性。

Conclusion: SCAR通过语义上下文驱动的方法有效解决了自回归模型在图像编辑中的局限性，为自回归模型在图像编辑领域的应用提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, autoregressive (AR) models have shown strong potential in image generation, offering better scalability and easier integration with unified multi-modal systems compared to diffusion-based methods. However, extending AR models to general image editing remains challenging due to weak and inefficient conditioning, often leading to poor instruction adherence and visual artifacts. To address this, we propose SCAR, a Semantic-Context-driven method for Autoregressive models. SCAR introduces two key components: Compressed Semantic Prefilling, which encodes high-level semantics into a compact and efficient prefix, and Semantic Alignment Guidance, which aligns the last visual hidden states with target semantics during autoregressive decoding to enhance instruction fidelity. Unlike decoding-stage injection methods, SCAR builds upon the flexibility and generality of vector-quantized-based prefilling while overcoming its semantic limitations and high cost. It generalizes across both next-token and next-set AR paradigms with minimal architectural changes. SCAR achieves superior visual fidelity and semantic alignment on both instruction editing and controllable generation benchmarks, outperforming prior AR-based methods while maintaining controllability. All code will be released.

TL;DR: CORE提出了一种基于对象中心表示的视觉令牌压缩新范式，通过高效分割解码器生成对象掩码作为语义先验，将视觉令牌合并为紧凑的对象中心表示，并在极端压缩下保持97.4%的基线性能。


<details>

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在处理高分辨率图像时面临计算和内存成本过高的问题，现有令牌压缩方法缺乏高层语义理解，导致次优合并、信息冗余或上下文丢失。

Method: 使用高效分割解码器生成对象掩码作为语义先验，指导视觉令牌合并为对象中心表示；采用质心引导排序机制恢复合并令牌的空间顺序，保留关键位置信息。

Result: 在六个权威基准测试中建立了固定率压缩的最新性能，在自适应率设置下实现显著效率提升，极端压缩下仅保留2.2%视觉令牌仍维持97.4%基线性能。

Conclusion: 对象中心表示为高效有效的LVLM处理提供了优越性，CORE在视觉令牌压缩方面实现了突破性进展。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) usually suffer from prohibitive computational and memory costs due to the quadratic growth of visual tokens with image resolution. Existing token compression methods, while varied, often lack a high-level semantic understanding, leading to suboptimal merges, information redundancy, or context loss. To address these limitations, we introduce CORE (Compact Object-centric REpresentations), a new paradigm for visual token compression. CORE leverages an efficient segmentation decoder to generate object masks, which serve as a high-level semantic prior to guide the merging of visual tokens into a compact set of object-centric representations. Furthermore, a novel centroid-guided sorting mechanism restores a coherent spatial order to the merged tokens, preserving vital positional information. Extensive experiments show that CORE not only establishes a new state-of-the-art on six authoritative benchmarks for fixed-rate compression, but also achieves dramatic efficiency gains in adaptive-rate settings. Even under extreme compression, after aggressively retaining with only 2.2% of all visual tokens, CORE still maintains 97.4% of baseline performance. Our work demonstrates the superiority of object-centric representations for efficient and effective LVLM processing.

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved remarkable success in medical image analysis but are fundamentally constrained by the requirement for large-scale, meticulously annotated datasets. This dependency on "big data" is a critical bottleneck in the medical domain, where patient data is inherently difficult to acquire and expert annotation is expensive, particularly for rare diseases where samples are scarce by definition. To overcome this fundamental challenge, we propose a novel paradigm: Zero-Training Task-Specific Model Synthesis (ZS-TMS). Instead of adapting a pre-existing model or training a new one, our approach leverages a large-scale, pre-trained generative engine to directly synthesize the entire set of parameters for a task-specific classifier. Our framework, the Semantic-Guided Parameter Synthesizer (SGPS), takes as input minimal, multi-modal task information as little as a single example image (1-shot) and a corresponding clinical text description to directly synthesize the entire set of parameters for a task-specific classifier.
  The generative engine interprets these inputs to generate the weights for a lightweight, efficient classifier (e.g., an EfficientNet-V2), which can be deployed for inference immediately without any task-specific training or fine-tuning. We conduct extensive evaluations on challenging few-shot classification benchmarks derived from the ISIC 2018 skin lesion dataset and a custom rare disease dataset. Our results demonstrate that SGPS establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming advanced few-shot and zero-shot learning methods, especially in the ultra-low data regimes of 1-shot and 5-shot classification. This work paves the way for the rapid development and deployment of AI-powered diagnostic tools, particularly for the long tail of rare diseases where data is critically limited.

Conclusion: 该方法是一个时间高效且临床可靠的工具，可用于肩关节不稳定的术前规划和筛查具有显著肩关节盂骨缺损的患者。

Abstract: Reliable measurement of glenoid bone loss is essential for operative planning in shoulder instability, but current manual and semi-automated methods are time-consuming and often subject to interreader variability. We developed and validated a fully automated deep learning pipeline for measuring glenoid bone loss on three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) scans using a linear-based, en-face view, best-circle method. Shoulder CT images of 91 patients (average age, 40 years; range, 14-89 years; 65 men) were retrospectively collected along with manual labels including glenoid segmentation, landmarks, and bone loss measurements. The multi-stage algorithm has three main stages: (1) segmentation, where we developed a U-Net to automatically segment the glenoid and humerus; (2) anatomical landmark detection, where a second network predicts glenoid rim points; and (3) geometric fitting, where we applied principal component analysis (PCA), projection, and circle fitting to compute the percentage of bone loss. The automated measurements showed strong agreement with consensus readings and exceeded surgeon-to-surgeon consistency (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) 0.84 vs 0.78), including in low- and high-bone-loss subgroups (ICC 0.71 vs 0.63 and 0.83 vs 0.21, respectively; P < 0.001). For classifying patients into low, medium, and high bone-loss categories, the pipeline achieved a recall of 0.714 for low and 0.857 for high severity, with no low cases misclassified as high or vice versa. These results suggest that our method is a time-efficient and clinically reliable tool for preoperative planning in shoulder instability and for screening patients with substantial glenoid bone loss.

Method: 引入DEER-3D框架，采用"分解、诊断评估、编辑、重新训练"的工作流程。当识别到3D-LLM的基础失败时，首先诊断具体的谓词级错误（如属性或空间关系），然后执行最小化的谓词对齐3D场景编辑（如重新着色或重新定位），生成针对性反事实监督数据进行迭代模型微调。

Result: 在多个3D基础和场景理解任务的基准测试中评估编辑流程，通过迭代优化在所有评估数据集上一致展示了改进效果。

Conclusion: DEER-3D证明了针对性、错误驱动的场景编辑在弥合3D LLMs中语言推理能力与空间基础之间的差距方面的有效性。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in 3D-LLMs, they remain limited in accurately grounding language to visual and spatial elements in 3D environments. This limitation stems in part from training data that focuses on language reasoning rather than spatial understanding due to scarce 3D resources, leaving inherent grounding biases unresolved. To address this, we propose 3D scene editing as a key mechanism to generate precise visual counterfactuals that mitigate these biases through fine-grained spatial manipulation, without requiring costly scene reconstruction or large-scale 3D data collection. Furthermore, to make these edits targeted and directly address the specific weaknesses of the model, we introduce DEER-3D, an error-driven framework following a structured "Decompose, Diagnostic Evaluation, Edit, and Re-train" workflow, rather than broadly or randomly augmenting data as in conventional approaches. Specifically, upon identifying a grounding failure of the 3D-LLM, our framework first diagnoses the exact predicate-level error (e.g., attribute or spatial relation). It then executes minimal, predicate-aligned 3D scene edits, such as recoloring or repositioning, to produce targeted counterfactual supervision for iterative model fine-tuning, significantly enhancing grounding accuracy. We evaluate our editing pipeline across multiple benchmarks for 3D grounding and scene understanding tasks, consistently demonstrating improvements across all evaluated datasets through iterative refinement. DEER-3D underscores the effectiveness of targeted, error-driven scene editing in bridging linguistic reasoning capabilities with spatial grounding in 3D LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统U-Net难以捕获长距离依赖，Transformer变体计算量大且需要大量训练数据，需要一种既高效又能建模全局上下文的分割方法。

Method: 在ResNet-50残差块中集成分组坐标注意力(GCA)，通过分组坐标建模联合编码通道和空间位置的全局依赖，增强特征表示和边界描绘。

Result: 在Synapse数据集上Dice得分为86.11%，在ACDC数据集上达到92.64%，超越多个SOTA基线，同时保持快速推理和良好计算效率。

Conclusion: GCA为卷积架构增强全局建模能力提供了实用方法，实现了高精度且资源高效的医学图像分割。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation underpins computer-aided diagnosis and therapy by supporting clinical diagnosis, preoperative planning, and disease monitoring. While U-Net style convolutional neural networks perform well due to their encoder-decoder structures with skip connections, they struggle to capture long-range dependencies. Transformer-based variants address global context but often require heavy computation and large training datasets. This paper proposes GCA-ResUNet, an efficient segmentation network that integrates Grouped Coordinate Attention (GCA) into ResNet-50 residual blocks. GCA uses grouped coordinate modeling to jointly encode global dependencies across channels and spatial locations, strengthening feature representation and boundary delineation while adding minimal parameter and FLOP overhead compared with self-attention. On the Synapse dataset, GCA-ResUNet achieves a Dice score of 86.11%, and on the ACDC dataset, it reaches 92.64%, surpassing several state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining fast inference and favorable computational efficiency. These results indicate that GCA offers a practical way to enhance convolutional architectures with global modeling capability, enabling high-accuracy and resource-efficient medical image segmentation.

TL;DR: SMGeo是一个基于Transformer的可提示端到端跨视角物体地理定位模型，支持点击提示并实时输出地理定位结果，在无人机到卫星任务中达到领先性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统多阶段"检索-匹配"方法在跨视角物体地理定位中因视角和尺度差异大、背景干扰复杂而导致的累积误差问题。

Method: 采用全Transformer架构，使用Swin-Transformer进行无人机和卫星图像的联合特征编码，引入网格级稀疏专家混合(GMoE)来捕获跨模态和视图内依赖关系，使用无锚检测头通过热图监督直接预测物体位置。

Conclusion: SMGeo通过共享编码、查询引导融合和网格级稀疏专家混合的互补增益，实现了高效的跨视角物体地理定位。

Abstract: Cross-view object Geo-localization aims to precisely pinpoint the same object across large-scale satellite imagery based on drone images. Due to significant differences in viewpoint and scale, coupled with complex background interference, traditional multi-stage "retrieval-matching" pipelines are prone to cumulative errors. To address this, we present SMGeo, a promptable end-to-end transformer-based model for object Geo-localization. This model supports click prompting and can output object Geo-localization in real time when prompted to allow for interactive use. The model employs a fully transformer-based architecture, utilizing a Swin-Transformer for joint feature encoding of both drone and satellite imagery and an anchor-free transformer detection head for coordinate regression. In order to better capture both inter-modal and intra-view dependencies, we introduce a grid-level sparse Mixture-of-Experts (GMoE) into the cross-view encoder, allowing it to adaptively activate specialized experts according to the content, scale and source of each grid. We also employ an anchor-free detection head for coordinate regression, directly predicting object locations via heat-map supervision in the reference images. This approach avoids scale bias and matching complexity introduced by predefined anchor boxes. On the drone-to-satellite task, SMGeo achieves leading performance in accuracy at IoU=0.25 and mIoU metrics (e.g., 87.51%, 62.50%, and 61.45% in the test set, respectively), significantly outperforming representative methods such as DetGeo (61.97%, 57.66%, and 54.05%, respectively). Ablation studies demonstrate complementary gains from shared encoding, query-guided fusion, and grid-level sparse mixture-of-experts.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于交叉熵损失的长尾识别方法难以学习具有理想特性的特征，且在Softmax分母中耦合了不平衡的分类器向量，放大了长尾识别中的不平衡效应

Method: BCE3S包含三个组件：基于BCE的联合学习优化分类器和样本特征；基于BCE的对比学习进一步提升特征的类内紧凑性；基于BCE的均匀学习平衡分类器向量间的分离性

Result: 在CIFAR10-LT、CIFAR100-LT、ImageNet-LT和iNaturalist2018等多个长尾数据集上达到SOTA性能，实现了更高的特征紧凑性和分离性

Conclusion: BCE3S方法通过三元协同学习有效解决了长尾识别中的特征学习和分类器平衡问题

Abstract: For long-tailed recognition (LTR) tasks, high intra-class compactness and inter-class separability in both head and tail classes, as well as balanced separability among all the classifier vectors, are preferred. The existing LTR methods based on cross-entropy (CE) loss not only struggle to learn features with desirable properties but also couple imbalanced classifier vectors in the denominator of its Softmax, amplifying the imbalance effects in LTR. In this paper, for the LTR, we propose a binary cross-entropy (BCE)-based tripartite synergistic learning, termed BCE3S, which consists of three components: (1) BCE-based joint learning optimizes both the classifier and sample features, which achieves better compactness and separability among features than the CE-based joint learning, by decoupling the metrics between feature and the imbalanced classifier vectors in multiple Sigmoid; (2) BCE-based contrastive learning further improves the intra-class compactness of features; (3) BCE-based uniform learning balances the separability among classifier vectors and interactively enhances the feature properties by combining with the joint learning. The extensive experiments show that the LTR model trained by BCE3S not only achieves higher compactness and separability among sample features, but also balances the classifier's separability, achieving SOTA performance on various long-tailed datasets such as CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist2018.

TL;DR: FAPE-IR是一个频率感知规划和执行框架，用于多任务图像恢复。它使用冻结的多模态大语言模型作为规划器分析退化图像并生成频率感知恢复计划，然后通过基于扩散的执行器动态选择高频或低频专家进行恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多任务图像恢复方法依赖特定任务设计或潜在路由策略，难以适应真实世界中各种复杂退化情况，需要一个统一的、可解释的解决方案。

Method: 使用冻结MLLM作为规划器生成频率感知恢复计划，通过LoRA-MoE模块在扩散执行器中动态选择高频/低频专家，结合输入图像的频率特征，并引入对抗训练和频率正则化损失。

Result: 在七个恢复任务上达到最先进性能，在混合退化条件下表现出强大的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过将语义规划与基于频率的恢复相结合，FAPE-IR为多任务图像恢复提供了一个统一且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: All-in-One Image Restoration (AIO-IR) aims to develop a unified model that can handle multiple degradations under complex conditions. However, existing methods often rely on task-specific designs or latent routing strategies, making it hard to adapt to real-world scenarios with various degradations. We propose FAPE-IR, a Frequency-Aware Planning and Execution framework for image restoration. It uses a frozen Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as a planner to analyze degraded images and generate concise, frequency-aware restoration plans. These plans guide a LoRA-based Mixture-of-Experts (LoRA-MoE) module within a diffusion-based executor, which dynamically selects high- or low-frequency experts, complemented by frequency features of the input image. To further improve restoration quality and reduce artifacts, we introduce adversarial training and a frequency regularization loss. By coupling semantic planning with frequency-based restoration, FAPE-IR offers a unified and interpretable solution for all-in-one image restoration. Extensive experiments show that FAPE-IR achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven restoration tasks and exhibits strong zero-shot generalization under mixed degradations.

TL;DR: RIVER是一个基于推理的视频编辑模型，能够通过多跳推理理解隐式查询来推断编辑目标，然后执行视频修改。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频编辑方法需要用户提供明确的空间位置和时间边界描述，这在用户试图通过语义属性或对象关系的隐式查询来构思编辑时变得不切实际。

Method: RIVER通过数字孪生表示解耦推理和生成，使用大语言模型进行多跳推理，输出结构化指令指导基于扩散的编辑器执行像素级修改，并使用强化学习训练。

Result: RIVER在提出的RVEBenchmark上表现最佳，并在VegGIE和FiVE两个额外视频编辑基准上达到最先进性能，超越了六个基线方法。

Conclusion: RIVER成功解决了推理视频编辑这一复杂任务，能够有效处理隐式查询，为视频编辑提供了更直观和智能的交互方式。

Abstract: Text-driven video editing enables users to modify video content only using text queries. While existing methods can modify video content if explicit descriptions of editing targets with precise spatial locations and temporal boundaries are provided, these requirements become impractical when users attempt to conceptualize edits through implicit queries referencing semantic properties or object relationships. We introduce reasoning video editing, a task where video editing models must interpret implicit queries through multi-hop reasoning to infer editing targets before executing modifications, and a first model attempting to solve this complex task, RIVER (Reasoning-based Implicit Video Editor). RIVER decouples reasoning from generation through digital twin representations of video content that preserve spatial relationships, temporal trajectories, and semantic attributes. A large language model then processes this representation jointly with the implicit query, performing multi-hop reasoning to determine modifications, then outputs structured instructions that guide a diffusion-based editor to execute pixel-level changes. RIVER training uses reinforcement learning with rewards that evaluate reasoning accuracy and generation quality. Finally, we introduce RVEBenchmark, a benchmark of 100 videos with 519 implicit queries spanning three levels and categories of reasoning complexity specifically for reasoning video editing. RIVER demonstrates best performance on the proposed RVEBenchmark and also achieves state-of-the-art performance on two additional video editing benchmarks (VegGIE and FiVE), where it surpasses six baseline methods.

Conclusion: RTS-Mono是一种高效、轻量的实时自监督单目深度估计方法，在保持高性能的同时实现了快速推理，为自动驾驶和机器人导航的实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Depth information is crucial for autonomous driving and intelligent robot navigation. The simplicity and flexibility of self-supervised monocular depth estimation are conducive to its role in these fields. However, most existing monocular depth estimation models consume many computing resources. Although some methods have reduced the model's size and improved computing efficiency, the performance deteriorates, seriously hindering the real-world deployment of self-supervised monocular depth estimation models in the real world. To address this problem, we proposed a real-time self-supervised monocular depth estimation method and implemented it in the real world. It is called RTS-Mono, which is a lightweight and efficient encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder is based on Lite-Encoder, and the decoder is designed with a multi-scale sparse fusion framework to minimize redundancy, ensure performance, and improve inference speed. RTS-Mono achieved state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance in high and low resolutions with extremely low parameter counts (3 M) in experiments based on the KITTI dataset. Compared with lightweight methods, RTS-Mono improved Abs Rel and Sq Rel by 5.6% and 9.8% at low resolution and improved Sq Rel and RMSE by 6.1% and 1.9% at high resolution. In real-world deployment experiments, RTS-Mono has extremely high accuracy and can perform real-time inference on Nvidia Jetson Orin at a speed of 49 FPS.

Motivation: 现有的最优传输聚合方法在处理图像特征和聚类中心分布差异时，由于对称处理源和目标边缘分布而效果受限，需要非对称匹配机制来适应视觉位置识别中的分布差异。

Method: 采用行-列归一化平均与分离边缘校准的非对称聚合方法，结合可学习坐标嵌入的几何约束，计算融合特征相似度的兼容性分数，促进空间邻近特征分配到同一聚类。

Conclusion: A²GC-VPR方法通过非对称聚合和几何约束有效提升了视觉位置识别的性能，验证了该方法在应对特征分布差异和增强空间感知方面的有效性。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) aims to match query images against a database using visual cues. State-of-the-art methods aggregate features from deep backbones to form global descriptors. Optimal transport-based aggregation methods reformulate feature-to-cluster assignment as a transport problem, but the standard Sinkhorn algorithm symmetrically treats source and target marginals, limiting effectiveness when image features and cluster centers exhibit substantially different distributions. We propose an asymmetric aggregation VPR method with geometric constraints for locally aggregated descriptors, called $A^2$GC-VPR. Our method employs row-column normalization averaging with separate marginal calibration, enabling asymmetric matching that adapts to distributional discrepancies in visual place recognition. Geometric constraints are incorporated through learnable coordinate embeddings, computing compatibility scores fused with feature similarities, thereby promoting spatially proximal features to the same cluster and enhancing spatial awareness. Experimental results on MSLS, NordLand, and Pittsburgh datasets demonstrate superior performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach in improving matching accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a range of computer vision tasks; however, their high computational, memory, and energy demands hinder deployment on resource-constrained platforms. In this paper, we propose \emph{Cascaded-ViT (CViT)}, a lightweight and compute-efficient vision transformer architecture featuring a novel feedforward network design called \emph{Cascaded-Chunk Feed Forward Network (CCFFN)}. By splitting input features, CCFFN improves parameter and FLOP efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Experiments on ImageNet-1K show that our \emph{CViT-XL} model achieves 75.5\% Top-1 accuracy while reducing FLOPs by 15\% and energy consumption by 3.3\% compared to EfficientViT-M5. Across various model sizes, the CViT family consistently exhibits the lowest energy consumption, making it suitable for deployment on battery-constrained devices such as mobile phones and drones. Furthermore, when evaluated using a new metric called \emph{Accuracy-Per-FLOP (APF)}, which quantifies compute efficiency relative to accuracy, CViT models consistently achieve top-ranking efficiency. Particularly, CViT-L is 2.2\% more accurate than EfficientViT-M2 while having comparable APF scores.

Motivation: 解决文本到图像扩散模型在微调时学习不需要的概念以及与用户提示纠缠的问题，这对于偏见缓解、防止恶意适应、属性解缠和扩散策略的通用微调等下游任务至关重要。

Method: 通过保持用户提示的嵌入与不需要的概念不对齐来正则化适应过程，使用语言描述指定不需要的概念，无需额外训练即可灵活修改不需要的概念。

Conclusion: Coffee提供了一种有效的方法来控制扩散模型在微调过程中学习的内容，通过语言描述灵活指定不需要的概念，为下游应用提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models can generate diverse content with flexible prompts, which makes them well-suited for customization through fine-tuning with a small amount of user-provided data. However, controllable fine-tuning that prevents models from learning undesired concepts present in the fine-tuning data, and from entangling those concepts with user prompts, remains an open challenge. It is crucial for downstream tasks like bias mitigation, preventing malicious adaptation, attribute disentanglement, and generalizable fine-tuning of diffusion policy. We propose Coffee that allows using language to specify undesired concepts to regularize the adaptation process. The crux of our method lies in keeping the embeddings of the user prompt from aligning with undesired concepts. Crucially, Coffee requires no additional training and enables flexible modification of undesired concepts by modifying textual descriptions. We evaluate Coffee by fine-tuning on images associated with user prompts paired with undesired concepts. Experimental results demonstrate that Coffee can prevent text-to-image models from learning specified undesired concepts during fine-tuning and outperforms existing methods. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Conclusion: MP-PVIR框架能够将多视角视频数据系统转化为结构化诊断报告，推进了车路协同系统中AI驱动的交通安全分析。

Abstract: Pedestrian-vehicle incidents remain a critical urban safety challenge, with pedestrians accounting for over 20% of global traffic fatalities. Although existing video-based systems can detect when incidents occur, they provide little insight into how these events unfold across the distinct cognitive phases of pedestrian behavior. Recent vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong potential for video understanding, but they remain limited in that they typically process videos in isolation, without explicit temporal structuring or multi-view integration. This paper introduces Multi-view Phase-aware Pedestrian-Vehicle Incident Reasoning (MP-PVIR), a unified framework that systematically processes multi-view video streams into structured diagnostic reports through four stages: (1) event-triggered multi-view video acquisition, (2) pedestrian behavior phase segmentation, (3) phase-specific multi-view reasoning, and (4) hierarchical synthesis and diagnostic reasoning. The framework operationalizes behavioral theory by automatically segmenting incidents into cognitive phases, performing synchronized multi-view analysis within each phase, and synthesizing results into causal chains with targeted prevention strategies. Particularly, two specialized VLMs underpin the MP-PVIR pipeline: TG-VLM for behavioral phase segmentation (mIoU = 0.4881) and PhaVR-VLM for phase-aware multi-view analysis, achieving a captioning score of 33.063 and up to 64.70% accuracy on question answering. Finally, a designated large language model is used to generate comprehensive reports detailing scene understanding, behavior interpretation, causal reasoning, and prevention recommendations. Evaluation on the Woven Traffic Safety dataset shows that MP-PVIR effectively translates multi-view video data into actionable insights, advancing AI-driven traffic safety analytics for vehicle-infrastructure cooperative systems.

Motivation: 传统上卷积神经网络和Transformer被视为根本不同的架构，但作者认为两者都可以统一在邻居选择和聚合的框架下，揭示它们之间的连续谱系关系。

Method: 引入卷积最近邻(ConvNN)框架，作为卷积层和注意力层的即插即用替代品，支持在空间邻近性和特征相似性选择之间进行系统探索。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了一个统一框架，消除了卷积和注意力之间的表面区别，为设计更原则化和可解释的视觉架构提供了启示。

Abstract: The shift from Convolutional Neural Networks to Transformers has reshaped computer vision, yet these two architectural families are typically viewed as fundamentally distinct. We argue that convolution and self-attention, despite their apparent differences, can be unified within a single k-nearest neighbor aggregation framework. The critical insight is that both operations are special cases of neighbor selection and aggregation; convolution selects neighbors by spatial proximity, while attention selects by feature similarity, revealing they exist on a continuous spectrum. We introduce Convolutional Nearest Neighbors (ConvNN), a unified framework that formalizes this connection. Crucially, ConvNN serves as a drop-in replacement for convolutional and attention layers, enabling systematic exploration of the intermediate spectrum between these two extremes. We validate the framework's coherence on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 classification tasks across two complementary architectures: (1) Hybrid branching in VGG improves accuracy on both CIFAR datasets by combining spatial-proximity and feature-similarity selection; and (2) ConvNN in ViT outperforms standard attention and other attention variants on both datasets. Extensive ablations on $k$ values and architectural variants reveal that interpolating along this spectrum provides regularization benefits by balancing local and global receptive fields. Our work provides a unifying framework that dissolves the apparent distinction between convolution and attention, with implications for designing more principled and interpretable vision architectures.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频时刻检索方法主要依赖粗粒度的时间理解和单一视觉模态，在复杂视频中表现受限。需要整合音频线索和更精细的时间结构来提升性能。

Result: 在Charades-STA数据集上，R1@0.5指标提升1.61%，R1@0.7指标提升2.59%。在QVHighlights数据集上也表现出显著改进。

Conclusion: SMART通过整合音频线索和镜头级时间结构，显著提升了视频时刻检索的性能，证明了多模态融合和精细时间建模的重要性。

Abstract: Video Moment Retrieval is a task in video understanding that aims to localize a specific temporal segment in an untrimmed video based on a natural language query. Despite recent progress in moment retrieval from videos using both traditional techniques and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM), most existing methods still rely on coarse temporal understanding and a single visual modality, limiting performance on complex videos. To address this, we introduce \textit{S}hot-aware \textit{M}ultimodal \textit{A}udio-enhanced \textit{R}etrieval of \textit{T}emporal \textit{S}egments (SMART), an MLLM-based framework that integrates audio cues and leverages shot-level temporal structure. SMART enriches multimodal representations by combining audio and visual features while applying \textbf{Shot-aware Token Compression}, which selectively retains high-information tokens within each shot to reduce redundancy and preserve fine-grained temporal details. We also refine prompt design to better utilize audio-visual cues. Evaluations on Charades-STA and QVHighlights show that SMART achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, including a 1.61\% increase in R1@0.5 and 2.59\% gain in R1@0.7 on Charades-STA.

Abstract: Recent trends in SLAM and visual navigation have embraced 3D Gaussians as the preferred scene representation, highlighting the importance of estimating camera poses from a single image using a pre-built Gaussian model. However, existing approaches typically rely on an iterative \textit{render-compare-refine} loop, where candidate views are first rendered using NeRF or Gaussian Splatting, then compared against the target image, and finally, discrepancies are used to update the pose. This multi-round process incurs significant computational overhead, hindering real-time performance in robotics. In this paper, we propose iGaussian, a two-stage feed-forward framework that achieves real-time camera pose estimation through direct 3D Gaussian inversion. Our method first regresses a coarse 6DoF pose using a Gaussian Scene Prior-based Pose Regression Network with spatial uniform sampling and guided attention mechanisms, then refines it through feature matching and multi-model fusion. The key contribution lies in our cross-correlation module that aligns image embeddings with 3D Gaussian attributes without differentiable rendering, coupled with a Weighted Multiview Predictor that fuses features from Multiple strategically sampled viewpoints. Experimental results on the NeRF Synthetic, Mip-NeRF 360, and T\&T+DB datasets demonstrate a significant performance improvement over previous methods, reducing median rotation errors to 0.2° while achieving 2.87 FPS tracking on mobile robots, which is an impressive 10 times speedup compared to optimization-based approaches.

Motivation: 解决现有毫米波重建方法覆盖范围有限、噪声高的问题，开发能够推断完整3D几何形状的物理感知形状补全模型，为机器人、增强现实和物流等领域开辟新应用。

Method: 采用三阶段流水线：提出候选几何表面、使用专门为毫米波信号设计的基于transformer的形状补全模型、进行熵引导的表面选择。该方法结合了毫米波信号的物理特性与视觉形状补全的最新进展。

Result: 在与最先进基线的直接比较中，Wave-Former将召回率从54%提升到72%，同时保持85%的高精度。

Abstract: We present Wave-Former, a novel method capable of high-accuracy 3D shape reconstruction for completely occluded, diverse, everyday objects. This capability can open new applications spanning robotics, augmented reality, and logistics. Our approach leverages millimeter-wave (mmWave) wireless signals, which can penetrate common occlusions and reflect off hidden objects. In contrast to past mmWave reconstruction methods, which suffer from limited coverage and high noise, Wave-Former introduces a physics-aware shape completion model capable of inferring full 3D geometry. At the heart of Wave-Former's design is a novel three-stage pipeline which bridges raw wireless signals with recent advancements in vision-based shape completion by incorporating physical properties of mmWave signals. The pipeline proposes candidate geometric surfaces, employs a transformer-based shape completion model designed specifically for mmWave signals, and finally performs entropy-guided surface selection. This enables Wave-Former to be trained using entirely synthetic point-clouds, while demonstrating impressive generalization to real-world data.In head-to-head comparisons with state-of-the-art baselines, Wave-Former raises recall from 54% to 72% while maintaining a high precision of 85%.

TL;DR: 提出了RiSe框架解决多模态人脸反欺骗中的跨域泛化问题，通过非对称不变风险最小化和多模态协同解耦来应对模态表示不变风险和模态协同不变风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态人脸反欺骗方法在未见域中性能下降比单模态更严重，主要由于两个被忽视的风险：模态表示不变风险（表示在域偏移下是否保持泛化性）和模态协同不变风险（模型过拟合到域特定的模态间相关性）。

Method: RiSe框架包含两个核心组件：1) 非对称不变风险最小化(AsyIRM)，在径向空间学习不变球形决策边界以适应非对称分布；2) 多模态协同解耦(MMSD)，通过跨样本混合和解耦的自监督任务增强内在、可泛化的模态特征。

Result: 理论分析和实验验证了RiSe的有效性，在跨域性能上达到了最先进水平。

Conclusion: RiSe框架成功解决了多模态人脸反欺骗中的跨域泛化问题，通过处理表示和协同两个关键风险，显著提升了模型在未见域中的性能表现。

Abstract: Multimodal Face Anti-Spoofing (FAS) methods, which integrate multiple visual modalities, often suffer even more severe performance degradation than unimodal FAS when deployed in unseen domains. This is mainly due to two overlooked risks that affect cross-domain multimodal generalization. The first is the modal representation invariant risk, i.e., whether representations remain generalizable under domain shift. We theoretically show that the inherent class asymmetry in FAS (diverse spoofs vs. compact reals) enlarges the upper bound of generalization error, and this effect is further amplified in multimodal settings. The second is the modal synergy invariant risk, where models overfit to domain-specific inter-modal correlations. Such spurious synergy cannot generalize to unseen attacks in target domains, leading to performance drops. To solve these issues, we propose a provable framework, namely Multimodal Representation and Synergy Invariance Learning (RiSe). For representation risk, RiSe introduces Asymmetric Invariant Risk Minimization (AsyIRM), which learns an invariant spherical decision boundary in radial space to fit asymmetric distributions, while preserving domain cues in angular space. For synergy risk, RiSe employs Multimodal Synergy Disentanglement (MMSD), a self-supervised task enhancing intrinsic, generalizable modal features via cross-sample mixing and disentanglement. Theoretical analysis and experiments verify RiSe, which achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain performance.

Conclusion: 通过构建专门的数据集和模型，成功提升了LVLM对抽象视觉输入（特别是手绘草图）的理解能力，填补了现有模型的空白。

Abstract: While Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, their ability to interpret abstract visual inputs remains limited. Specifically, they struggle to comprehend hand-drawn sketches, a modality that offers an intuitive means of expressing concepts that are difficult to describe textually. We identify the primary bottleneck as the absence of a large-scale dataset that jointly models sketches, photorealistic images, and corresponding natural language instructions. To address this, we present two key contributions: (1) a new, large-scale dataset of image-sketch-instruction triplets designed to facilitate both pretraining and instruction tuning, and (2) O3SLM, an LVLM trained on this dataset. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple sketch-based tasks: (a) object localization, (b) counting, (c) image retrieval i.e., (SBIR and fine-grained SBIR), and (d) visual question answering (VQA); while incorporating the three existing sketch datasets, namely QuickDraw!, Sketchy, and Tu Berlin, along with our generated SketchVCL dataset, show that O3SLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, substantially outperforming existing LVLMs in sketch comprehension and reasoning.

Abstract: Evaluating the robustness of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) is essential for their continued development and responsible deployment in real-world applications. However, existing robustness benchmarks typically focus on hallucination or misleading textual inputs, while largely overlooking the equally critical challenge posed by misleading visual inputs in assessing visual understanding. To fill this important gap, we introduce MVI-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark specially designed for evaluating how Misleading Visual Inputs undermine the robustness of LVLMs. Grounded in fundamental visual primitives, the design of MVI-Bench centers on three hierarchical levels of misleading visual inputs: Visual Concept, Visual Attribute, and Visual Relationship. Using this taxonomy, we curate six representative categories and compile 1,248 expertly annotated VQA instances. To facilitate fine-grained robustness evaluation, we further introduce MVI-Sensitivity, a novel metric that characterizes LVLM robustness at a granular level. Empirical results across 18 state-of-the-art LVLMs uncover pronounced vulnerabilities to misleading visual inputs, and our in-depth analyses on MVI-Bench provide actionable insights that can guide the development of more reliable and robust LVLMs. The benchmark and codebase can be accessed at https://github.com/chenyil6/MVI-Bench.

Conclusion: 提出的自适应令牌压缩方法有效解决了MLLMs中令牌数量过多的问题，显著减少了计算和内存需求，同时保持了高性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated substantial value in unified text-image understanding and reasoning, primarily by converting images into sequences of patch-level tokens that align with their architectural paradigm. However, patch-level tokenization leads to a quadratic growth in image tokens, burdening MLLMs' understanding and reasoning with enormous computation and memory. Additionally, the traditional patch-wise scanning tokenization workflow misaligns with the human vision cognition system, further leading to hallucination and computational redundancy. To address this issue, we propose an object-level token merging strategy for Adaptive Token compression, revealing the consistency with human vision system. The experiments are conducted on multiple comprehensive benchmarks, which show that our approach averagely, utilizes only 10% tokens while achieving almost 96% of the vanilla model's performance. More extensive experimental results in comparison with relevant works demonstrate the superiority of our method in balancing compression ratio and performance. Our code will be available.

Conclusion: DoGCLR在更具挑战性的场景中表现出强大的鲁棒性，验证了基于博弈论的对比学习框架的有效性。

Abstract: Existing self-supervised contrastive learning methods for skeleton-based action recognition often process all skeleton regions uniformly, and adopt a first-in-first-out (FIFO) queue to store negative samples, which leads to motion information loss and non-optimal negative sample selection. To address these challenges, this paper proposes Dominance-Game Contrastive Learning network for skeleton-based action Recognition (DoGCLR), a self-supervised framework based on game theory. DoGCLR models the construction of positive and negative samples as a dynamic Dominance Game, where both sample types interact to reach an equilibrium that balances semantic preservation and discriminative strength. Specifically, a spatio-temporal dual weight localization mechanism identifies key motion regions and guides region-wise augmentations to enhance motion diversity while maintaining semantics. In parallel, an entropy-driven dominance strategy manages the memory bank by retaining high entropy (hard) negatives and replacing low-entropy (weak) ones, ensuring consistent exposure to informative contrastive signals. Extensive experiments are conducted on NTU RGB+D and PKU-MMD datasets. On NTU RGB+D 60 X-Sub/X-View, DoGCLR achieves 81.1%/89.4% accuracy, and on NTU RGB+D 120 X-Sub/X-Set, DoGCLR achieves 71.2%/75.5% accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 0.1%, 2.7%, 1.1%, and 2.3%, respectively. On PKU-MMD Part I/Part II, DoGCLR performs comparably to the state-of-the-art methods and achieves a 1.9% higher accuracy on Part II, highlighting its strong robustness on more challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: 通过利用软效应的共同本质和构建大规模多样化数据集，UniSER展示了在单一框架内处理多种图像退化问题的强大能力，为图像恢复领域提供了新的基础模型。

Abstract: Digital images are often degraded by soft effects such as lens flare, haze, shadows, and reflections, which reduce aesthetics even though the underlying pixels remain partially visible. The prevailing works address these degradations in isolation, developing highly specialized, specialist models that lack scalability and fail to exploit the shared underlying essences of these restoration problems. While specialist models are limited, recent large-scale pretrained generalist models offer powerful, text-driven image editing capabilities. while recent general-purpose systems (e.g., GPT-4o, Flux Kontext, Nano Banana) require detailed prompts and often fail to achieve robust removal on these fine-grained tasks or preserve identity of the scene. Leveraging the common essence of soft effects, i.e., semi-transparent occlusions, we introduce a foundational versatile model UniSER, capable of addressing diverse degradations caused by soft effects within a single framework. Our methodology centers on curating a massive 3.8M-pair dataset to ensure robustness and generalization, which includes novel, physically-plausible data to fill critical gaps in public benchmarks, and a tailored training pipeline that fine-tunes a Diffusion Transformer to learn robust restoration priors from this diverse data, integrating fine-grained mask and strength controls. This synergistic approach allows UniSER to significantly outperform both specialist and generalist models, achieving robust, high-fidelity restoration in the wild.

Conclusion: GloTok通过全局关系建模产生了更均匀分布的语义潜在表示，促进了自回归模型训练高质量图像生成，且训练过程无需直接访问预训练模型。

Abstract: Existing state-of-the-art image tokenization methods leverage diverse semantic features from pre-trained vision models for additional supervision, to expand the distribution of latent representations and thereby improve the quality of image reconstruction and generation. These methods employ a locally supervised approach for semantic supervision, which limits the uniformity of semantic distribution. However, VA-VAE proves that a more uniform feature distribution yields better generation performance. In this work, we introduce a Global Perspective Tokenizer (GloTok), which utilizes global relational information to model a more uniform semantic distribution of tokenized features. Specifically, a codebook-wise histogram relation learning method is proposed to transfer the semantics, which are modeled by pre-trained models on the entire dataset, to the semantic codebook. Then, we design a residual learning module that recovers the fine-grained details to minimize the reconstruction error caused by quantization. Through the above design, GloTok delivers more uniformly distributed semantic latent representations, which facilitates the training of autoregressive (AR) models for generating high-quality images without requiring direct access to pre-trained models during the training process. Experiments on the standard ImageNet-1k benchmark clearly show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance and generation quality.

Abstract: Most existing autonomous-driving datasets (e.g., KITTI, nuScenes, and the Waymo Perception Dataset), collected by human-driving mode or unidentified driving mode, can only serve as early training for the perception and prediction of autonomous vehicles (AVs). To evaluate the real behavioral safety of AVs controlled in the black box, we present the first end-to-end benchmark dataset collected entirely by autonomous-driving mode in the real world. This dataset contains over 100 hours of naturalistic data from multiple production autonomous-driving vehicle models in the market. We segment the original data into 32,727 key frames, each consisting of four synchronized camera images and high-precision GNSS/IMU data (0.8 cm localization accuracy). For each key frame, 20 Hz vehicle trajectories spanning the past 6 s and future 5 s are provided, along with detailed 2D annotations of surrounding vehicles, pedestrians, traffic lights, and traffic signs. These key frames have rich scenario-level attributes, including driver intent, area type (covering highways, urban roads, and residential areas), lighting (day, night, or dusk), weather (clear or rain), road surface (paved or unpaved), traffic and vulnerable road users (VRU) density, traffic lights, and traffic signs (warning, prohibition, and indication). To evaluate the safety of AVs, we employ an end-to-end motion planning model that predicts vehicle trajectories with an Average Displacement Error (ADE) of 1.4 m on autonomous-driving frames. The dataset continues to expand by over 10 hours of new data weekly, thereby providing a sustainable foundation for research on AV driving behavior analysis and safety evaluation.

Conclusion: UMEG-Net为少样本精确事件检测提供了可扩展且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Precise event spotting (PES) aims to recognize fine-grained events at exact moments and has become a key component of sports analytics. This task is particularly challenging due to rapid succession, motion blur, and subtle visual differences. Consequently, most existing methods rely on domain-specific, end-to-end training with large labeled datasets and often struggle in few-shot conditions due to their dependence on pixel- or pose-based inputs alone. However, obtaining large labeled datasets is practically hard. We propose a Unified Multi-Entity Graph Network (UMEG-Net) for few-shot PES. UMEG-Net integrates human skeletons and sport-specific object keypoints into a unified graph and features an efficient spatio-temporal extraction module based on advanced GCN and multi-scale temporal shift. To further enhance performance, we employ multimodal distillation to transfer knowledge from keypoint-based graphs to visual representations. Our approach achieves robust performance with limited labeled data and significantly outperforms baseline models in few-shot settings, providing a scalable and effective solution for few-shot PES. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/LZYAndy/UMEG-Net.

Abstract: The aorta, the body's largest artery, is prone to pathologies such as dissection, aneurysm, and atherosclerosis, which often require timely intervention. Minimally invasive repairs involving branch vessels necessitate detailed 3D anatomical analysis. Existing methods often overlook hierarchical anatomical relationships while struggling with severe class imbalance inherent in vascular structures. We address these challenges with a curriculum learning strategy that leverages a novel fractal softmax for hierarchical semantic learning. Inspired by human cognition, our approach progressively learns anatomical constraints by decomposing complex structures from simple to complex components. The curriculum learning framework naturally addresses class imbalance by first establishing robust feature representations for dominant classes before tackling rare but anatomically critical structures, significantly accelerating model convergence in multi-class scenarios. Our two-stage inference strategy achieves up to fivefold acceleration, enhancing clinical practicality. On the validation set at epoch 50, our hierarchical semantic loss improves the Dice score of nnU-Net ResEnc M by 11.65%. The proposed model demonstrates a 5.6% higher Dice score than baselines on the test set. Experimental results show significant improvements in segmentation accuracy and efficiency, making the framework suitable for real-time clinical applications. The implementation code for this challenge entry is publicly available at: https://github.com/PengchengShi1220/AortaSeg24.

Abstract: High-quality data has become a primary driver of progress under scale laws, with curated datasets often outperforming much larger unfiltered ones at lower cost. Online data curation extends this idea by dynamically selecting training samples based on the model's evolving state. While effective in classification and multimodal learning, existing online sampling strategies rarely extend to object detection because of its structural complexity and domain gaps. We introduce DetGain, an online data curation method specifically for object detection that estimates the marginal perturbation of each image to dataset-level Average Precision (AP) based on its prediction quality. By modeling global score distributions, DetGain efficiently estimates the global AP change and computes teacher-student contribution gaps to select informative samples at each iteration. The method is architecture-agnostic and minimally intrusive, enabling straightforward integration into diverse object detection architectures. Experiments on the COCO dataset with multiple representative detectors show consistent improvements in accuracy. DetGain also demonstrates strong robustness under low-quality data and can be effectively combined with knowledge distillation techniques to further enhance performance, highlighting its potential as a general and complementary strategy for data-efficient object detection.

Abstract: Maritime vessel re-identification (Re-ID) plays a crucial role in advancing maritime monitoring and intelligent situational awareness systems. However, some existing vessel Re-ID methods are directly adapted from pedestrian-focused algorithms, making them ill-suited for mitigating the unique problems present in vessel images, particularly the greater intra-identity variations and more severe missing of local parts, which lead to the emergence of outlier samples within the same identity. To address these challenges, we propose the Multi-scale Correlation-aware Transformer Network (MCFormer), which explicitly models multi-scale correlations across the entire input set to suppress the adverse effects of outlier samples with intra-identity variations or local missing, incorporating two novel modules, the Global Correlation Module (GCM), and the Local Correlation Module (LCM). Specifically, GCM constructs a global similarity affinity matrix across all input images to model global correlations through feature aggregation based on inter-image consistency, rather than solely learning features from individual images as in most existing approaches. Simultaneously, LCM mines and aligns local features of positive samples with contextual similarity to extract local correlations by maintaining a dynamic memory bank, effectively compensating for missing or occluded regions in individual images. To further enhance feature robustness, MCFormer integrates global and local features that have been respectively correlated across multiple scales, effectively capturing latent relationships among image features. Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that MCFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstantViR是一个基于预训练视频扩散先验的超快速视频重建框架，通过将双向视频扩散模型蒸馏为因果自回归学生模型，实现单次前向传播的实时视频恢复，在保持高质量的同时达到35+ FPS。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有扩散方法在视频重建中的问题：图像扩散模型加临时正则化器会导致时间伪影，而原生视频扩散模型的迭代后验采样速度过慢，无法满足实时应用需求。

Method: 将预训练的双向视频扩散模型（教师）蒸馏为因果自回归学生模型，仅需教师扩散模型和已知退化算子，无需外部配对数据；使用LeanVAE替换VAE骨干网，通过教师空间正则化蒸馏实现低延迟潜在空间处理。

Result: 在流式随机修复、高斯去模糊和超分辨率任务中，InstantViR达到或超过扩散基线的重建质量，在A100 GPU上运行超过35 FPS，比迭代视频扩散求解器快100倍。

Conclusion: 扩散基视频重建可与实时、交互式、可编辑的流式场景兼容，使高质量视频恢复成为现代视觉系统的实用组件。

Abstract: Video inverse problems are fundamental to streaming, telepresence, and AR/VR, where high perceptual quality must coexist with tight latency constraints. Diffusion-based priors currently deliver state-of-the-art reconstructions, but existing approaches either adapt image diffusion models with ad hoc temporal regularizers - leading to temporal artifacts - or rely on native video diffusion models whose iterative posterior sampling is far too slow for real-time use. We introduce InstantViR, an amortized inference framework for ultra-fast video reconstruction powered by a pre-trained video diffusion prior. We distill a powerful bidirectional video diffusion model (teacher) into a causal autoregressive student that maps a degraded video directly to its restored version in a single forward pass, inheriting the teacher's strong temporal modeling while completely removing iterative test-time optimization. The distillation is prior-driven: it only requires the teacher diffusion model and known degradation operators, and does not rely on externally paired clean/noisy video data. To further boost throughput, we replace the video-diffusion backbone VAE with a high-efficiency LeanVAE via an innovative teacher-space regularized distillation scheme, enabling low-latency latent-space processing. Across streaming random inpainting, Gaussian deblurring and super-resolution, InstantViR matches or surpasses the reconstruction quality of diffusion-based baselines while running at over 35 FPS on NVIDIA A100 GPUs, achieving up to 100 times speedups over iterative video diffusion solvers. These results show that diffusion-based video reconstruction is compatible with real-time, interactive, editable, streaming scenarios, turning high-quality video restoration into a practical component of modern vision systems.

Motivation: 现有盲人脸恢复方法通常产生确定性结果，无法捕捉低质量输入对应多个可能高质量重建的一对多特性。

Method: 将BFR构建为测量约束生成任务，通过粗恢复的受控退化构建逆问题，在文本到图像扩散中进行后验引导采样，包含前向测量和后向测量约束。

Result: 实验表明MCS能够生成与提示对齐的结果，并在BFR任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MCS方法成功实现了盲人脸恢复中的多样化重建，能够根据不同的文本提示生成多个合理的高质量结果。

Abstract: Blind face restoration (BFR) may correspond to multiple plausible high-quality (HQ) reconstructions under extremely low-quality (LQ) inputs. However, existing methods typically produce deterministic results, struggling to capture this one-to-many nature. In this paper, we propose a Measurement-Constrained Sampling (MCS) approach that enables diverse LQ face reconstructions conditioned on different textual prompts. Specifically, we formulate BFR as a measurement-constrained generative task by constructing an inverse problem through controlled degradations of coarse restorations, which allows posterior-guided sampling within text-to-image diffusion. Measurement constraints include both Forward Measurement, which ensures results align with input structures, and Reverse Measurement, which produces projection spaces, ensuring that the solution can align with various prompts. Experiments show that our MCS can generate prompt-aligned results and outperforms existing BFR methods. Codes will be released after acceptance.

Conclusion: 提出的流式处理方法有效解决了长音频序列的性能和延迟问题，为实时语音驱动3D面部动画提供了可行方案。

Abstract: This paper focuses on the task of speech-driven 3D facial animation, which aims to generate realistic and synchronized facial motions driven by speech inputs.Recent methods have employed audio-conditioned diffusion models for 3D facial animation, achieving impressive results in generating expressive and natural animations.However, these methods process the whole audio sequences in a single pass, which poses two major challenges: they tend to perform poorly when handling audio sequences that exceed the training horizon and will suffer from significant latency when processing long audio inputs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel autoregressive diffusion model that processes input audio in a streaming manner. This design ensures flexibility with varying audio lengths and achieves low latency independent of audio duration. Specifically, we select a limited number of past frames as historical motion context and combine them with the audio input to create a dynamic condition. This condition guides the diffusion process to iteratively generate facial motion frames, enabling real-time synthesis with high-quality results. Additionally, we implemented a real-time interactive demo, highlighting the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. We will release the code at https://zju3dv.github.io/StreamingTalker/.

Conclusion: APS方法能够有效增强运动预测的主动感知能力，具有模型无关性，可集成到不同预测模型中提升性能。

Abstract: Forecasting 3D human motion is an important embodiment of fine-grained understanding and cognition of human behavior by artificial agents. Current approaches excessively rely on implicit network modeling of spatiotemporal relationships and motion characteristics, falling into the passive learning trap that results in redundant and monotonous 3D coordinate information acquisition while lacking actively guided explicit learning mechanisms. To overcome these issues, we propose an Active Perceptual Strategy (APS) for human motion prediction, leveraging quotient space representations to explicitly encode motion properties while introducing auxiliary learning objectives to strengthen spatio-temporal modeling. Specifically, we first design a data perception module that projects poses into the quotient space, decoupling motion geometry from coordinate redundancy. By jointly encoding tangent vectors and Grassmann projections, this module simultaneously achieves geometric dimension reduction, semantic decoupling, and dynamic constraint enforcement for effective motion pose characterization. Furthermore, we introduce a network perception module that actively learns spatio-temporal dependencies through restorative learning. This module deliberately masks specific joints or injects noise to construct auxiliary supervision signals. A dedicated auxiliary learning network is designed to actively adapt and learn from perturbed information. Notably, APS is model agnostic and can be integrated with different prediction models to enhance active perceptual. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves the new state-of-the-art, outperforming existing methods by large margins: 16.3% on H3.6M, 13.9% on CMU Mocap, and 10.1% on 3DPW.

Conclusion: WeSTAR框架通过有效的弱监督自训练和正则化策略，显著提升了单目深度估计基础模型在未见领域的鲁棒性和泛化性能。

Abstract: The emergence of foundation models has substantially advanced zero-shot generalization in monocular depth estimation (MDE), as exemplified by the Depth Anything series. However, given access to some data from downstream tasks, a natural question arises: can the performance of these models be further improved? To this end, we propose WeSTAR, a parameter-efficient framework that performs Weakly supervised Self-Training Adaptation with Regularization, designed to enhance the robustness of MDE foundation models in unseen and diverse domains. We first adopt a dense self-training objective as the primary source of structural self-supervision. To further improve robustness, we introduce semantically-aware hierarchical normalization, which exploits instance-level segmentation maps to perform more stable and multi-scale structural normalization. Beyond dense supervision, we introduce a cost-efficient weak supervision in the form of pairwise ordinal depth annotations to further guide the adaptation process, which enforces informative ordinal constraints to mitigate local topological errors. Finally, a weight regularization loss is employed to anchor the LoRA updates, ensuring training stability and preserving the model's generalizable knowledge. Extensive experiments on both realistic and corrupted out-of-distribution datasets under diverse and challenging scenarios demonstrate that WeSTAR consistently improves generalization and achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of benchmarks.

Abstract: Multi-agents rely on accurate poses to share and align observations, enabling a collaborative perception of the environment. However, traditional GNSS-based localization often fails in GNSS-denied environments, making consistent feature alignment difficult in collaboration. To tackle this challenge, we propose a robust GNSS-free collaborative perception framework based on LiDAR localization. Specifically, we propose a lightweight Pose Generator with Confidence (PGC) to estimate compact pose and confidence representations. To alleviate the effects of localization errors, we further develop the Pose-Aware Spatio-Temporal Alignment Transformer (PASTAT), which performs confidence-aware spatial alignment while capturing essential temporal context. Additionally, we present a new simulation dataset, V2VLoc, which can be adapted for both LiDAR localization and collaborative detection tasks. V2VLoc comprises three subsets: Town1Loc, Town4Loc, and V2VDet. Town1Loc and Town4Loc offer multi-traversal sequences for training in localization tasks, whereas V2VDet is specifically intended for the collaborative detection task. Extensive experiments conducted on the V2VLoc dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance under GNSS-denied conditions. We further conduct extended experiments on the real-world V2V4Real dataset to validate the effectiveness and generalizability of PASTAT.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative models, powerful image editing methods now enable diverse and highly realistic image manipulations that far surpass traditional deepfake techniques, posing new challenges for manipulation detection. Existing image manipulation detection and localization (IMDL) benchmarks suffer from limited content diversity, narrow generative-model coverage, and insufficient interpretability, which hinders the generalization and explanation capabilities of current manipulation detection methods. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{ManipBench}, a large-scale benchmark for image manipulation detection and localization focusing on AI-edited images. ManipBench contains over 450K manipulated images produced by 25 state-of-the-art image editing models across 12 manipulation categories, among which 100K images are further annotated with bounding boxes, judgment cues, and textual explanations to support interpretable detection. Building upon ManipBench, we propose \textbf{ManipShield}, an all-in-one model based on a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that leverages contrastive LoRA fine-tuning and task-specific decoders to achieve unified image manipulation detection, localization, and explanation. Extensive experiments on ManipBench and several public datasets demonstrate that ManipShield achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits strong generality to unseen manipulation models. Both ManipBench and ManipShield will be released upon publication.

Conclusion: GSLR框架能够紧凑且连续地表示多维图像，特别擅长捕获局部高频信息，在图像恢复任务中展现出优越性能。

Abstract: Tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD) is a promising tool for multi-dimensional image representation, which decomposes a multi-dimensional image into a latent tensor and an accompanying transform matrix. However, two critical limitations of t-SVD methods persist: (1) the approximation of the latent tensor (e.g., tensor factorizations) is coarse and fails to accurately capture spatial local high-frequency information; (2) The transform matrix is composed of fixed basis atoms (e.g., complex exponential atoms in DFT and cosine atoms in DCT) and cannot precisely capture local high-frequency information along the mode-3 fibers. To address these two limitations, we propose a Gaussian Splatting-based Low-rank tensor Representation (GSLR) framework, which compactly and continuously represents multi-dimensional images. Specifically, we leverage tailored 2D Gaussian splatting and 1D Gaussian splatting to generate the latent tensor and transform matrix, respectively. The 2D and 1D Gaussian splatting are indispensable and complementary under this representation framework, which enjoys a powerful representation capability, especially for local high-frequency information. To evaluate the representation ability of the proposed GSLR, we develop an unsupervised GSLR-based multi-dimensional image recovery model. Extensive experiments on multi-dimensional image recovery demonstrate that GSLR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in capturing local high-frequency information.

Abstract: Text-to-3D generation has advanced rapidly, yet state-of-the-art models, encompassing both optimization-based and feed-forward architectures, still face two fundamental limitations. First, they struggle with coarse semantic alignment, often failing to capture fine-grained prompt details. Second, they lack robust 3D spatial understanding, leading to geometric inconsistencies and catastrophic failures in part assembly and spatial relationships. To address these challenges, we propose VLM3D, a general framework that repurposes large vision-language models (VLMs) as powerful, differentiable semantic and spatial critics. Our core contribution is a dual-query critic signal derived from the VLM's Yes or No log-odds, which assesses both semantic fidelity and geometric coherence. We demonstrate the generality of this guidance signal across two distinct paradigms: (1) As a reward objective for optimization-based pipelines, VLM3D significantly outperforms existing methods on standard benchmarks. (2) As a test-time guidance module for feed-forward pipelines, it actively steers the iterative sampling process of SOTA native 3D models to correct severe spatial errors. VLM3D establishes a principled and generalizable path to inject the VLM's rich, language-grounded understanding of both semantics and space into diverse 3D generative pipelines.

Abstract: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (CDFSL) endeavors to transfer generalized knowledge from the source domain to target domains using only a minimal amount of training data, which faces a triplet of learning challenges in the meantime, i.e., semantic disjoint, large domain discrepancy, and data scarcity. Different from predominant CDFSL works focused on generalized representations, we make novel attempts to construct Intermediate Domain Proxies (IDP) with source feature embeddings as the codebook and reconstruct the target domain feature with this learned codebook. We then conduct an empirical study to explore the intrinsic attributes from perspectives of visual styles and semantic contents in intermediate domain proxies. Reaping benefits from these attributes of intermediate domains, we develop a fast domain alignment method to use these proxies as learning guidance for target domain feature transformation. With the collaborative learning of intermediate domain reconstruction and target feature transformation, our proposed model is able to surpass the state-of-the-art models by a margin on 8 cross-domain few-shot learning benchmarks.

Conclusion: 该方法在解剖结构和模态间表现出强大的泛化能力，为CAOS提供鲁棒准确的跨模态对齐。

Abstract: In computer- and robot-assisted orthopedic surgery (CAOS), patient-specific surgical plans derived from preoperative imaging define target locations and implant trajectories. During surgery, these plans must be accurately transferred, relying on precise cross-registration between preoperative and intraoperative data. However, substantial modality heterogeneity across imaging modalities makes this registration challenging and error-prone. Robust, automatic, and modality-agnostic bone surface registration is therefore clinically important. We propose NeuralBoneReg, a self-supervised, surface-based framework that registers bone surfaces using 3D point clouds as a modality-agnostic representation. NeuralBoneReg includes two modules: an implicit neural unsigned distance field (UDF) that learns the preoperative bone model, and an MLP-based registration module that performs global initialization and local refinement by generating transformation hypotheses to align the intraoperative point cloud with the neural UDF. Unlike SOTA supervised methods, NeuralBoneReg operates in a self-supervised manner, without requiring inter-subject training data. We evaluated NeuralBoneReg against baseline methods on two publicly available multi-modal datasets: a CT-ultrasound dataset of the fibula and tibia (UltraBones100k) and a CT-RGB-D dataset of spinal vertebrae (SpineDepth). The evaluation also includes a newly introduced CT--ultrasound dataset of cadaveric subjects containing femur and pelvis (UltraBones-Hip), which will be made publicly available. NeuralBoneReg matches or surpasses existing methods across all datasets, achieving mean RRE/RTE of 1.68°/1.86 mm on UltraBones100k, 1.88°/1.89 mm on UltraBones-Hip, and 3.79°/2.45 mm on SpineDepth. These results demonstrate strong generalizability across anatomies and modalities, providing robust and accurate cross-modal alignment for CAOS.

Additionally, 3D scene generation is vital for advancing embodied AI and world models, which depend on diverse, high-quality scenes for learning and evaluation. In this work, we propose Gen3d, a novel method for generation of high-quality, wide-scope, and generic 3D scenes from a single image. After the initial point cloud is created by lifting the RGBD image, Gen3d maintains and expands its world model. The 3D scene is finalized through optimizing a Gaussian splatting representation. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate the strong generalization capability and superior performance of our method in generating a world model and Synthesizing high-fidelity and consistent novel views.

Conclusion: SAM-Fed通过利用基础模型指导轻量级客户端，有效解决了联邦半监督学习中伪标签质量和模型异构性的挑战。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is clinically important, yet data privacy and the cost of expert annotation limit the availability of labeled data. Federated semi-supervised learning (FSSL) offers a solution but faces two challenges: pseudo-label reliability depends on the strength of local models, and client devices often require compact or heterogeneous architectures due to limited computational resources. These constraints reduce the quality and stability of pseudo-labels, while large models, though more accurate, cannot be trained or used for routine inference on client devices. We propose SAM-Fed, a federated semi-supervised framework that leverages a high-capacity segmentation foundation model to guide lightweight clients during training. SAM-Fed combines dual knowledge distillation with an adaptive agreement mechanism to refine pixel-level supervision. Experiments on skin lesion and polyp segmentation across homogeneous and heterogeneous settings show that SAM-Fed consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSSL methods.

Conclusion: Diff-NAF通过迭代细化过程，在超稀疏视角条件下逐步提升投影完整性和重建保真度，最终获得高质量的CT重建结果

Abstract: Multi-source stationary computed tomography (CT) has recently attracted attention for its ability to achieve rapid image reconstruction, making it suitable for time-sensitive clinical and industrial applications. However, practical systems are often constrained by ultra-sparse-view sampling, which significantly degrades reconstruction quality. Traditional methods struggle under ultra-sparse-view settings, where interpolation becomes inaccurate and the resulting reconstructions are unsatisfactory. To address this challenge, this study proposes Diffusion-Refined Neural Attenuation Fields (Diff-NAF), an iterative framework tailored for multi-source stationary CT under ultra-sparse-view conditions. Diff-NAF combines a Neural Attenuation Field representation with a dual-branch conditional diffusion model. The process begins by training an initial NAF using ultra-sparse-view projections. New projections are then generated through an Angle-Prior Guided Projection Synthesis strategy that exploits inter view priors, and are subsequently refined by a Diffusion-driven Reuse Projection Refinement Module. The refined projections are incorporated as pseudo-labels into the training set for the next iteration. Through iterative refinement, Diff-NAF progressively enhances projection completeness and reconstruction fidelity under ultra-sparse-view conditions, ultimately yielding high-quality CT reconstructions. Experimental results on multiple simulated 3D CT volumes and real projection data demonstrate that Diff-NAF achieves the best performance under ultra-sparse-view conditions.

Abstract: Intraoral 3D reconstruction is fundamental to digital orthodontics, yet conventional methods like intraoral scanning are inaccessible for remote tele-orthodontics, which typically relies on sparse smartphone imagery. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) shows promise for novel view synthesis, its application to the standard clinical triad of unposed anterior and bilateral buccal photographs is challenging. The large view baselines, inconsistent illumination, and specular surfaces common in intraoral settings can destabilize simultaneous pose and geometry estimation. Furthermore, sparse-view photometric supervision often induces a frequency bias, leading to over-smoothed reconstructions that lose critical diagnostic details. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{Dental3R}, a pose-free, graph-guided pipeline for robust, high-fidelity reconstruction from sparse intraoral photographs. Our method first constructs a Geometry-Aware Pairing Strategy (GAPS) to intelligently select a compact subgraph of high-value image pairs. The GAPS focuses on correspondence matching, thereby improving the stability of the geometry initialization and reducing memory usage. Building on the recovered poses and point cloud, we train the 3DGS model with a wavelet-regularized objective. By enforcing band-limited fidelity using a discrete wavelet transform, our approach preserves fine enamel boundaries and interproximal edges while suppressing high-frequency artifacts. We validate our approach on a large-scale dataset of 950 clinical cases and an additional video-based test set of 195 cases. Experimental results demonstrate that Dental3R effectively handles sparse, unposed inputs and achieves superior novel view synthesis quality for dental occlusion visualization, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: With the rise in sedentary behavior, health problems caused by poor sitting posture have drawn increasing attention. Most existing methods, whether using invasive sensors or computer vision, rely on two-stage pipelines, which result in high intrusiveness, intensive computation, and poor real-time performance on embedded edge devices. Inspired by YOLOv11-Pose, a lightweight single-stage network for sitting posture recognition on embedded edge devices termed LSP-YOLO was proposed. By integrating partial convolution(PConv) and Similarity-Aware Activation Module(SimAM), a lightweight module, Light-C3k2, was designed to reduce computational cost while maintaining feature extraction capability. In the recognition head, keypoints were directly mapped to posture classes through pointwise convolution, and intermediate supervision was employed to enable efficient fusion of pose estimation and classification. Furthermore, a dataset containing 5,000 images across six posture categories was constructed for model training and testing. The smallest trained model, LSP-YOLO-n, achieved 94.2% accuracy and 251 Fps on personal computer(PC) with a model size of only 1.9 MB. Meanwhile, real-time and high-accuracy inference under constrained computational resources was demonstrated on the SV830C + GC030A platform. The proposed approach is characterized by high efficiency, lightweight design and deployability, making it suitable for smart classrooms, rehabilitation, and human-computer interaction applications.

Abstract: Scaling up network depth is a fundamental pursuit in neural architecture design, as theory suggests that deeper models offer exponentially greater capability. Benefiting from the residual connections, modern neural networks can scale up to more than one hundred layers and enjoy wide success. However, as networks continue to deepen, current architectures often struggle to realize their theoretical capacity improvements, calling for more advanced designs to further unleash the potential of deeper networks. In this paper, we identify two key barriers that obstruct residual models from scaling deeper: shortcut degradation and limited width. Shortcut degradation hinders deep-layer learning, while the inherent depth-width trade-off imposes limited width. To mitigate these issues, we propose a generalized residual architecture dubbed Step by Step Network (StepsNet) to bridge the gap between theoretical potential and practical performance of deep models. Specifically, we separate features along the channel dimension and let the model learn progressively via stacking blocks with increasing width. The resulting method mitigates the two identified problems and serves as a versatile macro design applicable to various models. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently outperforms residual models across diverse tasks, including image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and language modeling. These results position StepsNet as a superior generalization of the widely adopted residual architecture.

Conclusion: 结合几何标准化与本体引导的多模态推理为现代数字正畸中的3D口腔扫描结构化分析提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: A structured understanding of intraoral 3D scans is essential for digital orthodontics. However, existing deep-learning approaches rely heavily on modality-specific training, large annotated datasets, and controlled scanning conditions, which limit generalization across devices and hinder deployment in real clinical workflows. Moreover, raw intraoral meshes exhibit substantial variation in arch pose, incomplete geometry caused by occlusion or tooth contact, and a lack of texture cues, making unified semantic interpretation highly challenging. To address these limitations, we propose ArchMap, a training-free and knowledge-guided framework for robust structured dental understanding. ArchMap first introduces a geometry-aware arch-flattening module that standardizes raw 3D meshes into spatially aligned, continuity-preserving multi-view projections. We then construct a Dental Knowledge Base (DKB) encoding hierarchical tooth ontology, dentition-stage policies, and clinical semantics to constrain the symbolic reasoning space. We validate ArchMap on 1060 pre-/post-orthodontic cases, demonstrating robust performance in tooth counting, anatomical partitioning, dentition-stage classification, and the identification of clinical conditions such as crowding, missing teeth, prosthetics, and caries. Compared with supervised pipelines and prompted VLM baselines, ArchMap achieves higher accuracy, reduced semantic drift, and superior stability under sparse or artifact-prone conditions. As a fully training-free system, ArchMap demonstrates that combining geometric normalization with ontology-guided multimodal reasoning offers a practical and scalable solution for the structured analysis of 3D intraoral scans in modern digital orthodontics.

TL;DR: DentalSCR是一个用于口腔内扫描模型与侧位头颅X光片3D-2D配准的稳定轮廓引导框架，通过建立统一解剖坐标系和优化轮廓相似性，显著提升了临床条件下的配准精度和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于强度的配准方法在真实临床条件下（如投影放大、几何畸变、低对比度牙冠等）表现不佳，导致配准失败或解剖学上不合理的对齐。

Method: 首先构建U-Midline Dental Axis建立统一解剖坐标系，然后通过表面DRR生成X光样投影，最后使用双向Chamfer距离在分层粗到细策略下优化2D相似变换。

Result: 在34个临床病例上评估，显著降低了标志点误差（特别是后牙区域），下颌骨误差分布更集中，曲线级别的Chamfer和Hausdorff距离表现优异。

Conclusion: DentalSCR能够稳健处理真实世界头颅X光片，提供高保真度、临床可检查的3D-2D对齐，优于传统基线方法。

Abstract: Reliable 3D-2D alignment between intraoral scan (IOS) models and lateral cephalometric radiographs is critical for orthodontic diagnosis, yet conventional intensity-driven registration methods struggle under real clinical conditions, where cephalograms exhibit projective magnification, geometric distortion, low-contrast dental crowns, and acquisition-dependent variation. These factors hinder the stability of appearance-based similarity metrics and often lead to convergence failures or anatomically implausible alignments. To address these limitations, we propose DentalSCR, a pose-stable, contour-guided framework for accurate and interpretable silhouette-to-contour registration. Our method first constructs a U-Midline Dental Axis (UMDA) to establish a unified cross-arch anatomical coordinate system, thereby stabilizing initialization and standardizing projection geometry across cases. Using this reference frame, we generate radiograph-like projections via a surface-based DRR formulation with coronal-axis perspective and Gaussian splatting, which preserves clinical source-object-detector magnification and emphasizes external silhouettes. Registration is then formulated as a 2D similarity transform optimized with a symmetric bidirectional Chamfer distance under a hierarchical coarse-to-fine schedule, enabling both large capture range and subpixel-level contour agreement. We evaluate DentalSCR on 34 expert-annotated clinical cases. Experimental results demonstrate substantial reductions in landmark error-particularly at posterior teeth-tighter dispersion on the lower jaw, and low Chamfer and controlled Hausdorff distances at the curve level. These findings indicate that DentalSCR robustly handles real-world cephalograms and delivers high-fidelity, clinically inspectable 3D--2D alignment, outperforming conventional baselines.

Abstract: The proliferation of hour-long videos (e.g., lectures, podcasts, documentaries) has intensified demand for efficient content structuring. However, existing approaches are constrained by small-scale training with annotations that are typical short and coarse, restricting generalization to nuanced transitions in long videos. We introduce ARC-Chapter, the first large-scale video chaptering model trained on over million-level long video chapters, featuring bilingual, temporally grounded, and hierarchical chapter annotations. To achieve this goal, we curated a bilingual English-Chinese chapter dataset via a structured pipeline that unifies ASR transcripts, scene texts, visual captions into multi-level annotations, from short title to long summaries. We demonstrate clear performance improvements with data scaling, both in data volume and label intensity. Moreover, we design a new evaluation metric termed GRACE, which incorporates many-to-one segment overlaps and semantic similarity, better reflecting real-world chaptering flexibility. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ARC-Chapter establishes a new state-of-the-art by a significant margin, outperforming the previous best by 14.0% in F1 score and 11.3% in SODA score. Moreover, ARC-Chapter shows excellent transferability, improving the state-of-the-art on downstream tasks like dense video captioning on YouCook2.

Conclusion: Image-Based Gaussian Splatting是一种高效替代方案，能够实现高频细节和准确视角相关效果的渲染，同时保持存储效率。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a fast, high-quality method for novel view synthesis (NVS). However, its use of low-degree spherical harmonics limits its ability to capture spatially varying color and view-dependent effects such as specular highlights. Existing works augment Gaussians with either a global texture map, which struggles with complex scenes, or per-Gaussian texture maps, which introduces high storage overhead. We propose Image-Based Gaussian Splatting, an efficient alternative that leverages high-resolution source images for fine details and view-specific color modeling. Specifically, we model each pixel color as a combination of a base color from standard 3DGS rendering and a learned residual inferred from neighboring training images. This promotes accurate surface alignment and enables rendering images of high-frequency details and accurate view-dependent effects. Experiments on standard NVS benchmarks show that our method significantly outperforms prior Gaussian Splatting approaches in rendering quality, without increasing the storage footprint.

Conclusion: JFD3框架通过联合特征域去模糊和检测，有效提升了红外无人机模糊目标的检测能力

Abstract: Infrared unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) target images often suffer from motion blur degradation caused by rapid sensor movement, significantly reducing contrast between target and background. Generally, detection performance heavily depends on the discriminative feature representation between target and background. Existing methods typically treat deblurring as a preprocessing step focused on visual quality, while neglecting the enhancement of task-relevant features crucial for detection. Improving feature representation for detection under blur conditions remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel Joint Feature-Domain Deblurring and Detection end-to-end framework, dubbed JFD3. We design a dual-branch architecture with shared weights, where the clear branch guides the blurred branch to enhance discriminative feature representation. Specifically, we first introduce a lightweight feature restoration network, where features from the clear branch serve as feature-level supervision to guide the blurred branch, thereby enhancing its distinctive capability for detection. We then propose a frequency structure guidance module that refines the structure prior from the restoration network and integrates it into shallow detection layers to enrich target structural information. Finally, a feature consistency self-supervised loss is imposed between the dual-branch detection backbones, driving the blurred branch to approximate the feature representations of the clear one. Wealso construct a benchmark, named IRBlurUAV, containing 30,000 simulated and 4,118 real infrared UAV target images with diverse motion blur. Extensive experiments on IRBlurUAV demonstrate that JFD3 achieves superior detection performance while maintaining real-time efficiency.

Abstract: International standards for biometric identity documents mandate strict compliance with pose requirements, including the square presentation of a subject's shoulders. However, the literature on automated quality assessment offers few quantitative methods for evaluating this specific attribute. This paper proposes a Shoulder Presentation Evaluation (SPE) algorithm to address this gap. The method quantifies shoulder yaw and roll using only the 3D coordinates of two shoulder landmarks provided by common pose estimation frameworks. The algorithm was evaluated on a dataset of 121 portrait images. The resulting SPE scores demonstrated a strong Pearson correlation (r approx. 0.80) with human-assigned labels. An analysis of the metric's filtering performance, using an adapted Error-versus-Discard methodology, confirmed its utility in identifying non-compliant samples. The proposed algorithm is a viable lightweight tool for automated compliance checking in enrolment systems.

Result: 广泛评估表明，该物理对抗示例能成功欺骗立体模型产生错误的深度信息。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了现有隐藏攻击的隐蔽性和杀伤力，实现了在立体视觉中的有效对抗攻击。

Abstract: Though deep neural models adopted to realize the perception of autonomous driving have proven vulnerable to adversarial examples, known attacks often leverage 2D patches and target mostly monocular perception. Therefore, the effectiveness of Physical Adversarial Examples (PAEs) on stereo-based binocular depth estimation remains largely unexplored. To this end, we propose the first texture-enabled physical adversarial attack against stereo matching models in the context of autonomous driving. Our method employs a 3D PAE with global camouflage texture rather than a local 2D patch-based one, ensuring both visual consistency and attack effectiveness across different viewpoints of stereo cameras. To cope with the disparity effect of these cameras, we also propose a new 3D stereo matching rendering module that allows the PAE to be aligned with real-world positions and headings in binocular vision. We further propose a novel merging attack that seamlessly blends the target into the environment through fine-grained PAE optimization. It has significantly enhanced stealth and lethality upon existing hiding attacks that fail to get seamlessly merged into the background.

Result: 在CARLA的LangAuto基准测试中，相对LMDrive性能提升达14%，相对BEVDriver提升7%，同时持续减少交通灯和标志违规。

Conclusion: TLS-Assist通过显式安全关键物体识别有效提升了LLM驾驶代理的性能和安全性，是一个即插即用、模型无关的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for decision-making and planning in autonomous driving, showing promising reasoning capabilities and potential to generalize across diverse traffic situations. However, current LLM-based driving agents lack explicit mechanisms to enforce traffic rules and often struggle to reliably detect small, safety-critical objects such as traffic lights and signs. To address this limitation, we introduce TLS-Assist, a modular redundancy layer that augments LLM-based autonomous driving agents with explicit traffic light and sign recognition. TLS-Assist converts detections into structured natural language messages that are injected into the LLM input, enforcing explicit attention to safety-critical cues. The framework is plug-and-play, model-agnostic, and supports both single-view and multi-view camera setups. We evaluate TLS-Assist in a closed-loop setup on the LangAuto benchmark in CARLA. The results demonstrate relative driving performance improvements of up to 14% over LMDrive and 7% over BEVDriver, while consistently reducing traffic light and sign infractions. We publicly release the code and models on https://github.com/iis-esslingen/TLS-Assist.

TL;DR: BEDLAM2.0是一个新的3D人体运动数据集，相比BEDLAM数据集在相机运动、人体形状、动作、服装、头发、3D环境和鞋子等方面增加了多样性和真实感，特别适用于训练世界坐标系下的人体运动估计方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从视频中推断3D人体运动是一个具有挑战性的问题，许多应用需要在世界坐标系中估计人体运动。当存在人体和相机运动时，这个问题尤其困难。该领域进展受限的主要原因是缺乏包含真实人体和相机运动的地面真实数据的丰富视频数据。

Method: 开发了BEDLAM2.0数据集，通过引入更多样化和真实的相机及相机运动，增加人体形状、动作、服装、头发和3D环境的多样性和真实感，并添加了BEDLAM中缺失的鞋子元素。

Result: 与在BEDLAM上训练的最先进方法相比，在BEDLAM2.0上训练的方法准确率显著提高，特别是在估计世界坐标系中的人体运动方面表现更好。

Conclusion: BEDLAM2.0相比BEDLAM数据集有显著改进，为训练3D人体姿态和运动回归器提供了更好的资源，特别适用于世界坐标系下的人体运动估计任务。

Abstract: Inferring 3D human motion from video remains a challenging problem with many applications. While traditional methods estimate the human in image coordinates, many applications require human motion to be estimated in world coordinates. This is particularly challenging when there is both human and camera motion. Progress on this topic has been limited by the lack of rich video data with ground truth human and camera movement. We address this with BEDLAM2.0, a new dataset that goes beyond the popular BEDLAM dataset in important ways. In addition to introducing more diverse and realistic cameras and camera motions, BEDLAM2.0 increases diversity and realism of body shape, motions, clothing, hair, and 3D environments. Additionally, it adds shoes, which were missing in BEDLAM. BEDLAM has become a key resource for training 3D human pose and motion regressors today and we show that BEDLAM2.0 is significantly better, particularly for training methods that estimate humans in world coordinates. We compare state-of-the art methods trained on BEDLAM and BEDLAM2.0, and find that BEDLAM2.0 significantly improves accuracy over BEDLAM. For research purposes, we provide the rendered videos, ground truth body parameters, and camera motions. We also provide the 3D assets to which we have rights and links to those from third parties.

Motivation: 解决领域增量学习中统一视觉空间导致的域间干扰和语义扭曲问题，以及孤立参数导致的知识碎片化问题。

Method: 使用语言锚定的视觉对齐方法，通过文本参考锚点引导每个新领域的视觉表示保持一致的相对几何结构，该结构由类别名称之间的语义相似度定义。

Result: 在标准DIL基准测试中，LAVA相比现有最先进方法取得了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: LAVA通过语言锚定的相对对齐有效解决了领域增量学习中的知识保留和干扰问题，为跨领域知识重用提供了新思路。

Abstract: A key challenge in Domain Incremental Learning (DIL) is to continually learn under shifting distributions while preserving knowledge from previous domains. Existing methods face a fundamental dilemma. On one hand, projecting all domains into a single unified visual space leads to inter-domain interference and semantic distortion, as large shifts may vary with not only visual appearance but also underlying semantics. On the other hand, isolating domain-specific parameters causes knowledge fragmentation, creating "knowledge islands" that hamper knowledge reuse and exacerbate forgetting. To address this issue, we propose LAVA (Language-Anchored Visual Alignment), a novel DIL framework that replaces direct feature alignment with relative alignment driven by a text-based reference anchor. LAVA guides the visual representations of each incoming domain to preserve a consistent relative geometry, which is defined by mirroring the pairwise semantic similarities between the class names. This anchored geometric structure acts as a bridge across domains, enabling the retrieval of class-aware prior knowledge and facilitating robust feature aggregation. Extensive experiments on standard DIL benchmarks demonstrate that LAVA achieves significant performance improvements over state-of-the-arts. Code is available at https://github.com/ShuyiGeng/LAVA.

Conclusion: Cranio-ID框架提供了一种可靠且准确的颅骨标志点自动标注和跨模态匹配方法，在法医颅面识别中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: In forensic craniofacial identification and in many biomedical applications, craniometric landmarks are important. Traditional methods for locating landmarks are time-consuming and require specialized knowledge and expertise. Current methods utilize superimposition and deep learning-based methods that employ automatic annotation of landmarks. However, these methods are not reliable due to insufficient large-scale validation studies. In this paper, we proposed a novel framework Cranio-ID: First, an automatic annotation of landmarks on 2D skulls (which are X-ray scans of faces) with their respective optical images using our trained YOLO-pose models. Second, cross-modal matching by formulating these landmarks into graph representations and then finding semantic correspondence between graphs of these two modalities using cross-attention and optimal transport framework. Our proposed framework is validated on the S2F and CUHK datasets (CUHK dataset resembles with S2F dataset). Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of our proposed framework, which demonstrates significant improvements in both reliability and accuracy, as well as its effectiveness in cross-domain skull-to-face and sketch-to-face matching in forensic science.

Motivation: 探索新生儿低分辨率、颜色退化但时间连续的视觉体验如何促进视觉智能的稳健发展，为机器视觉提供反向工程框架。

Method: 使用CATDiet方法训练自监督学习模型，模拟婴儿视觉发展的三个阶段：灰度到彩色(C)、模糊到清晰(A)、保持时间连续性(T)。建立包含10个数据集的综合基准进行评估。

Result: 所有CATDiet变体在物体识别中表现出增强的鲁棒性，模型展现出与生物发育模式一致的行为，包括类似猕猴V1区突触密度的神经可塑性变化和婴儿视觉悬崖反应。

Conclusion: 婴儿早期视觉体验的渐进发展过程为理解机器中稳健视觉智能的出现提供了有力的反向工程框架。

Abstract: Newborns perceive the world with low-acuity, color-degraded, and temporally continuous vision, which gradually sharpens as infants develop. To explore the ecological advantages of such staged "visual diets", we train self-supervised learning (SSL) models on object-centric videos under constraints that simulate infant vision: grayscale-to-color (C), blur-to-sharp (A), and preserved temporal continuity (T)-collectively termed CATDiet. For evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark across ten datasets, covering clean and corrupted image recognition, texture-shape cue conflict tests, silhouette recognition, depth-order classification, and the visual cliff paradigm. All CATDiet variants demonstrate enhanced robustness in object recognition, despite being trained solely on object-centric videos. Remarkably, models also exhibit biologically aligned developmental patterns, including neural plasticity changes mirroring synaptic density in macaque V1 and behaviors resembling infants' visual cliff responses. Building on these insights, CombDiet initializes SSL with CATDiet before standard training while preserving temporal continuity. Trained on object-centric or head-mounted infant videos, CombDiet outperforms standard SSL on both in-domain and out-of-domain object recognition and depth perception. Together, these results suggest that the developmental progression of early infant visual experience offers a powerful reverse-engineering framework for understanding the emergence of robust visual intelligence in machines. All code, data, and models will be publicly released.

Conclusion: AVI提供了一种灵活、无需训练的视频理解框架，能够模拟人类视频理解过程，同时保持高性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Video understanding requires not only visual recognition but also complex reasoning. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities, they typically process videos largely in a single-pass manner with limited support for evidence revisit and iterative refinement. While recently emerging agent-based methods enable long-horizon reasoning, they either depend heavily on expensive proprietary models or require extensive agentic RL training. To overcome these limitations, we propose Agentic Video Intelligence (AVI), a flexible and training-free framework that can mirror human video comprehension through system-level design and optimization. AVI introduces three key innovations: (1) a human-inspired three-phase reasoning process (Retrieve-Perceive-Review) that ensures both sufficient global exploration and focused local analysis, (2) a structured video knowledge base organized through entity graphs, along with multi-granularity integrated tools, constituting the agent's interaction environment, and (3) an open-source model ensemble combining reasoning LLMs with lightweight base CV models and VLM, eliminating dependence on proprietary APIs or RL training. Experiments on LVBench, VideoMME-Long, LongVideoBench, and Charades-STA demonstrate that AVI achieves competitive performance while offering superior interpretability.

Result: 在多样化图像数据集上的综合实验表明，该对话驱动方法显著优于仅使用初始描述的基线方法，模块协同集成实现了更高的检索精度和更好的交互体验。

Conclusion: DIR-TIR框架通过多轮对话机制提供了优越的可控性和容错性，在交互式文本到图像检索任务中取得了显著性能提升。

Abstract: This paper addresses the task of interactive, conversational text-to-image retrieval.
  Our DIR-TIR framework progressively refines the target image search through two specialized modules: the Dialog Refiner Module and the Image Refiner Module.
  The Dialog Refiner actively queries users to extract essential information and generate increasingly precise descriptions of the target image.
  Complementarily, the Image Refiner identifies perceptual gaps between generated images and user intentions, strategically reducing the visual-semantic discrepancy. By leveraging multi-turn dialogues, DIR-TIR provides superior controllability and fault tolerance compared to conventional single-query methods, significantly improving target image hit accuracy.
  Comprehensive experiments across diverse image datasets demonstrate our dialogue-based approach substantially outperforms initial-description-only baselines, while the synergistic module integration achieves both higher retrieval precision and enhanced interactive experience.

Conclusion: CompEvent通过复值神经网络的全流程融合能力，有效解决了低光视频去模糊的挑战，实验证明其优于现有方法。

Abstract: Low-light video deblurring poses significant challenges in applications like nighttime surveillance and autonomous driving due to dim lighting and long exposures. While event cameras offer potential solutions with superior low-light sensitivity and high temporal resolution, existing fusion methods typically employ staged strategies, limiting their effectiveness against combined low-light and motion blur degradations. To overcome this, we propose CompEvent, a complex neural network framework enabling holistic full-process fusion of event data and RGB frames for enhanced joint restoration. CompEvent features two core components: 1) Complex Temporal Alignment GRU, which utilizes complex-valued convolutions and processes video and event streams iteratively via GRU to achieve temporal alignment and continuous fusion; and 2) Complex Space-Frequency Learning module, which performs unified complex-valued signal processing in both spatial and frequency domains, facilitating deep fusion through spatial structures and system-level characteristics. By leveraging the holistic representation capability of complex-valued neural networks, CompEvent achieves full-process spatiotemporal fusion, maximizes complementary learning between modalities, and significantly strengthens low-light video deblurring capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CompEvent outperforms SOTA methods in addressing this challenging task. The code is available at https://github.com/YuXie1/CompEvent.

Conclusion: 残差-先验设计结合物理约束能够产生空间一致、物理合理的床地形重建结果，适用于领域偏移下的操作制图。

Abstract: Accurate subglacial bed topography is essential for ice sheet modeling, yet radar observations are sparse and uneven. We propose a physics-guided residual learning framework that predicts bed thickness residuals over a BedMachine prior and reconstructs bed from the observed surface. A DeepLabV3+ decoder over a standard encoder (e.g.,ResNet-50) is trained with lightweight physics and data terms: multi-scale mass conservation, flow-aligned total variation, Laplacian damping, non-negativity of thickness, a ramped prior-consistency term, and a masked Huber fit to radar picks modulated by a confidence map. To measure real-world generalization, we adopt leakage-safe blockwise hold-outs (vertical/horizontal) with safety buffers and report metrics only on held-out cores. Across two Greenland sub-regions, our approach achieves strong test-core accuracy and high structural fidelity, outperforming U-Net, Attention U-Net, FPN, and a plain CNN. The residual-over-prior design, combined with physics, yields spatially coherent, physically plausible beds suitable for operational mapping under domain shift.

Conclusion: GST框架成功地将高斯泼溅技术应用于空间传输，消除了训练过程中的迭代传输计划计算，为计算机视觉任务提供了高效的概率测度传输解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces Gaussian Spatial Transport (GST), a novel framework that leverages Gaussian splatting to facilitate transport from the probability measure in the image coordinate space to the annotation map. We propose a Gaussian splatting-based method to estimate pixel-annotation correspondence, which is then used to compute a transport plan derived from Bayesian probability. To integrate the resulting transport plan into standard network optimization in typical computer vision tasks, we derive a loss function that measures discrepancy after transport. Extensive experiments on representative computer vision tasks, including crowd counting and landmark detection, validate the effectiveness of our approach. Compared to conventional optimal transport schemes, GST eliminates iterative transport plan computation during training, significantly improving efficiency.

Conclusion: SEED-SR方法能够以前所未有的20倍尺度因子生成分割图，有效解决了结合不同分辨率卫星图像进行农场边界分割的问题。

Abstract: Delineating farm boundaries through segmentation of satellite images is a fundamental step in many agricultural applications. The task is particularly challenging for smallholder farms, where accurate delineation requires the use of high resolution (HR) imagery which are available only at low revisit frequencies (e.g., annually). To support more frequent (sub-) seasonal monitoring, HR images could be combined as references (ref) with low resolution (LR) images -- having higher revisit frequency (e.g., weekly) -- using reference-based super-resolution (Ref-SR) methods. However, current Ref-SR methods optimize perceptual quality and smooth over crucial features needed for downstream tasks, and are unable to meet the large scale-factor requirements for this task. Further, previous two-step approaches of SR followed by segmentation do not effectively utilize diverse satellite sources as inputs. We address these problems through a new approach, $\textbf{SEED-SR}$, which uses a combination of conditional latent diffusion models and large-scale multi-spectral, multi-source geo-spatial foundation models. Our key innovation is to bypass the explicit SR task in the pixel space and instead perform SR in a segmentation-aware latent space. This unique approach enables us to generate segmentation maps at an unprecedented 20$\times$ scale factor, and rigorous experiments on two large, real datasets demonstrate up to $\textbf{25.5}$ and $\textbf{12.9}$ relative improvement in instance and semantic segmentation metrics respectively over approaches based on state-of-the-art Ref-SR methods.

Conclusion: RSD框架通过风险注意力蒸馏有效增强了自动驾驶系统的泛化能力，使系统行为更接近人类驾驶，在复杂动态环境中表现更优。

Abstract: The autonomous driving (AD) system has exhibited remarkable performance in complex driving scenarios. However, generalization is still a key limitation for the current system, which refers to the ability to handle unseen scenarios or unfamiliar sensor configurations.Related works have explored the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to address few-shot or zero-shot tasks. While promising, these methods introduce a new challenge: the emergence of a hybrid AD system, where two distinct systems are used to plan a trajectory, leading to potential inconsistencies. Alternative research directions have explored Vision-Language-Action (VLA) frameworks that generate control actions from VLM directly. However, these end-to-end solutions demonstrate prohibitive computational demands. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Risk Semantic Distillation (RSD), a novel framework that leverages VLMs to enhance the training of End-to-End (E2E) AD backbones. By providing risk attention for key objects, RSD addresses the issue of generalization. Specifically, we introduce RiskHead, a plug-in module that distills causal risk estimates from Vision-Language Models into Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features, yielding interpretable risk-attention maps.This approach allows BEV features to learn richer and more nuanced risk attention representations, which directly enhance the model's ability to handle spatial boundaries and risky objects.By focusing on risk attention, RSD aligns better with human-like driving behavior, which is essential to navigate in complex and dynamic environments. Our experiments on the Bench2Drive benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of RSD in managing complex and unpredictable driving conditions. Due to the enhanced BEV representations enabled by RSD, we observed a significant improvement in both perception and planning capabilities.

Abstract: Understanding the inter-relations and interactions between tasks is crucial for multi-task dense prediction. Existing methods predominantly utilize convolutional layers and attention mechanisms to explore task-level interactions. In this work, we introduce a novel decoder-based framework, Parameter Aware Mamba Model (PAMM), specifically designed for dense prediction in multi-task learning setting. Distinct from approaches that employ Transformers to model holistic task relationships, PAMM leverages the rich, scalable parameters of state space models to enhance task interconnectivity. It features dual state space parameter experts that integrate and set task-specific parameter priors, capturing the intrinsic properties of each task. This approach not only facilitates precise multi-task interactions but also allows for the global integration of task priors through the structured state space sequence model (S4). Furthermore, we employ the Multi-Directional Hilbert Scanning method to construct multi-angle feature sequences, thereby enhancing the sequence model's perceptual capabilities for 2D data. Extensive experiments on the NYUD-v2 and PASCAL-Context benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our code is available at https://github.com/CQC-gogopro/PAMM.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频变分自编码器忽略了帧间内容相似性，导致潜在建模冗余

Method: 将视频内容分解为关键帧、运动和残差组件，为每个组件设计专用编码器，使用共享3D解码器保持时空一致性，采用解耦适应策略进行稳定训练

Result: 广泛的定量和定性实验表明DeCo-VAE实现了优异的视频重建性能

Conclusion: DeCo-VAE通过内容解耦方法有效解决了视频VAE中的冗余建模问题

Abstract: Existing video Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) generally overlook the similarity between frame contents, leading to redundant latent modeling. In this paper, we propose decoupled VAE (DeCo-VAE) to achieve compact latent representation. Instead of encoding RGB pixels directly, we decompose video content into distinct components via explicit decoupling: keyframe, motion and residual, and learn dedicated latent representation for each. To avoid cross-component interference, we design dedicated encoders for each decoupled component and adopt a shared 3D decoder to maintain spatiotemporal consistency during reconstruction. We further utilize a decoupled adaptation strategy that freezes partial encoders while training the others sequentially, ensuring stable training and accurate learning of both static and dynamic features. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that DeCo-VAE achieves superior video reconstruction performance.

TL;DR: D-PerceptCT是一种受人类视觉系统启发的LDCT图像增强架构，通过视觉双路径提取器和全局-局部状态空间块来增强感知相关特征，并使用深度感知相关性损失函数来优化结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低剂量CT图像质量较差，现有方法容易过度平滑导致关键细节丢失，需要一种能够增强感知相关特征的方法来帮助放射科医生诊断。

Method: 提出D-PerceptCT架构，包含视觉双路径提取器（整合预训练DINOv2模型的语义先验和局部空间特征）和全局-局部状态空间块（捕获长距离信息和多尺度特征），以及深度感知相关性损失函数。

Result: 在Mayo2016数据集上的实验表明，D-PerceptCT相比现有SOTA方法能更好地保留LDCT图像中的结构和纹理信息。

Conclusion: D-PerceptCT通过模拟人类视觉系统原理，有效增强了LDCT图像质量，为放射科医生提供了包含关键解剖结构和病理细节的感知可见图像。

Abstract: Low Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) is widely used as an imaging solution to aid diagnosis and other clinical tasks. However, this comes at the price of a deterioration in image quality due to the low dose of radiation used to reduce the risk of secondary cancer development. While some efficient methods have been proposed to enhance LDCT quality, many overestimate noise and perform excessive smoothing, leading to a loss of critical details. In this paper, we introduce D-PerceptCT, a novel architecture inspired by key principles of the Human Visual System (HVS) to enhance LDCT images. The objective is to guide the model to enhance or preserve perceptually relevant features, thereby providing radiologists with CT images where critical anatomical structures and fine pathological details are perceptu- ally visible. D-PerceptCT consists of two main blocks: 1) a Visual Dual-path Extractor (ViDex), which integrates semantic priors from a pretrained DINOv2 model with local spatial features, allowing the network to incorporate semantic-awareness during enhancement; (2) a Global-Local State-Space block that captures long-range information and multiscale features to preserve the important structures and fine details for diagnosis. In addition, we propose a novel deep perceptual loss, designated as the Deep Perceptual Relevancy Loss Function (DPRLF), which is inspired by human contrast sensitivity, to further emphasize perceptually important features. Extensive experiments on the Mayo2016 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of D-PerceptCT method for LDCT enhancement, showing better preservation of structural and textural information within LDCT images compared to SOTA methods.

TL;DR: 提出ForensicFlow三模态取证框架，融合RGB、纹理和频率证据进行Deepfake检测，在Celeb-DF数据集上取得优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单流CNN无法捕捉跨空间、纹理和频率域的多尺度伪造伪影，限制了Deepfake检测的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Method: 使用三模态框架：RGB分支（ConvNeXt-tiny）提取全局视觉不一致性；纹理分支（Swin Transformer-tiny）检测细粒度融合伪影；频率分支（CNN+SE）识别周期性频谱噪声。采用注意力机制进行时间池化和分支融合。

Result: 在Celeb-DF数据集上达到AUC 0.9752、F1-Score 0.9408、准确率0.9208，优于单流基线方法。

Conclusion: 多模态特征融合提供了对细微伪造的优越鲁棒性，消融实验验证了分支协同作用，Grad-CAM确认了取证焦点。

Abstract: Deepfakes generated by advanced GANs and autoencoders severely threaten information integrity and societal stability. Single-stream CNNs fail to capture multi-scale forgery artifacts across spatial, texture, and frequency domains, limiting robustness and generalization. We introduce the ForensicFlow, a tri-modal forensic framework that synergistically fuses RGB, texture, and frequency evidence for video Deepfake detection. The RGB branch (ConvNeXt-tiny) extracts global visual inconsistencies; the texture branch (Swin Transformer-tiny) detects fine-grained blending artifacts; the frequency branch (CNN + SE) identifies periodic spectral noise. Attention-based temporal pooling dynamically prioritizes high-evidence frames, while adaptive attention fusion balances branch contributions.Trained on Celeb-DF (v2) with Focal Loss, ForensicFlow achieves AUC 0.9752, F1-Score 0.9408, and accuracy 0.9208, outperforming single-stream baselines. Ablation validates branch synergy; Grad-CAM confirms forensic focus. This comprehensive feature fusion provides superior resilience against subtle forgeries.

Abstract: Underwater image restoration and enhancement are crucial for correcting color distortion and restoring image details, thereby establishing a fundamental basis for subsequent underwater visual tasks. However, current deep learning methodologies in this area are frequently constrained by the scarcity of high-quality paired datasets. Since it is difficult to obtain pristine reference labels in underwater scenes, existing benchmarks often rely on manually selected results from enhancement algorithms, providing debatable reference images that lack globally consistent color and authentic supervision. This limits the model's capabilities in color restoration, image enhancement, and generalization. To overcome this limitation, we propose using in-air natural images as unambiguous reference targets and translating them into underwater-degraded versions, thereby constructing synthetic datasets that provide authentic supervision signals for model learning. Specifically, we establish a generative data framework based on unpaired image-to-image translation, producing a large-scale dataset that covers 6 representative underwater degradation types. The framework constructs synthetic datasets with precise ground-truth labels, which facilitate the learning of an accurate mapping from degraded underwater images to their pristine scene appearances. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments across 6 representative network architectures and 3 independent test sets show that models trained on our synthetic data achieve comparable or superior color restoration and generalization performance to those trained on existing benchmarks. This research provides a reliable and scalable data-driven solution for underwater image restoration and enhancement. The generated dataset is publicly available at: https://github.com/yftian2025/SynUIEDatasets.git.

Conclusion: 该方法成功克服了多个SDF分析中的障碍，能够用更紧凑的潜在表示恢复高保真几何细节。

Abstract: Neural signed distance functions (SDFs) have been a vital representation to represent 3D shapes or scenes with neural networks. An SDF is an implicit function that can query signed distances at specific coordinates for recovering a 3D surface. Although implicit functions work well on a single shape or scene, they pose obstacles when analyzing multiple SDFs with high-fidelity geometry details, due to the limited information encoded in the latent space for SDFs and the loss of geometry details. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce a method to represent multiple SDFs in a common space, aiming to recover more high-fidelity geometry details with more compact latent representations. Our key idea is to take full advantage of the benefits of generalization-based and overfitting-based learning strategies, which manage to preserve high-fidelity geometry details with compact latent codes. Based on this framework, we also introduce a novel sampling strategy to sample training queries. The sampling can improve the training efficiency and eliminate artifacts caused by the influence of other SDFs. We report numerical and visual evaluations on widely used benchmarks to validate our designs and show advantages over the latest methods in terms of the representative ability and compactness.

Conclusion: HyMAD为地震活动识别提供了模块化框架，可扩展应用于现实世界安全应用中的同时活动检测。

Abstract: Seismic sensing has emerged as a promising solution for border surveillance and monitoring; the seismic sensors that are often buried underground are small and cannot be noticed easily, making them difficult for intruders to detect, avoid, or vandalize. This significantly enhances their effectiveness compared to highly visible cameras or fences. However, accurately detecting and distinguishing between overlapping activities that are happening simultaneously, such as human intrusions, animal movements, and vehicle rumbling, remains a major challenge due to the complex and noisy nature of seismic signals. Correctly identifying simultaneous activities is critical because failing to separate them can lead to misclassification, missed detections, and an incomplete understanding of the situation, thereby reducing the reliability of surveillance systems. To tackle this problem, we propose HyMAD (Hybrid Multi-Activity Detection), a deep neural architecture based on spatio-temporal feature fusion. The framework integrates spectral features extracted with SincNet and temporal dependencies modeled by a recurrent neural network (RNN). In addition, HyMAD employs self-attention layers to strengthen intra-modal representations and a cross-modal fusion module to achieve robust multi-label classification of seismic events. e evaluate our approach on a dataset constructed from real-world field recordings collected in the context of border surveillance and monitoring, demonstrating its ability to generalize to complex, simultaneous activity scenarios involving humans, animals, and vehicles. Our method achieves competitive performance and offers a modular framework for extending seismic-based activity recognition in real-world security applications.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效解决复杂手-物体交互场景的重建问题，在几何和外观建模方面表现出色。

Abstract: This paper focuses on a challenging setting of simultaneously modeling geometry and appearance of hand-object interaction scenes without any object priors. We follow the trend of dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting based methods, and address several significant challenges. To model complex hand-object interaction with mutual occlusion and edge blur, we present interaction-aware hand-object Gaussians with newly introduced optimizable parameters aiming to adopt piecewise linear hypothesis for clearer structural representation. Moreover, considering the complementarity and tightness of hand shape and object shape during interaction dynamics, we incorporate hand information into object deformation field, constructing interaction-aware dynamic fields to model flexible motions. To further address difficulties in the optimization process, we propose a progressive strategy that handles dynamic regions and static background step by step. Correspondingly, explicit regularizations are designed to stabilize the hand-object representations for smooth motion transition, physical interaction reality, and coherent lighting. Experiments show that our approach surpasses existing dynamic 3D-GS-based methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstructing dynamic hand-object interaction.

TL;DR: 将ARC重新定义为视觉问题，使用Vision Transformer进行图像到图像转换，在ARC-1基准上达到60.4%准确率，显著优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ARC任务本质上是视觉问题，但现有研究多从语言角度处理。本文旨在从视觉中心视角解决ARC，利用视觉先验知识

Method: 将ARC输入表示为"画布"，使用标准Vision Transformer架构进行图像到图像映射，仅使用ARC数据进行从头训练，通过测试时训练实现泛化

Result: 在ARC-1基准上达到60.4%准确率，大幅超越其他从头训练的方法，与领先的LLM性能相当，接近人类平均表现

Conclusion: 视觉中心的方法在抽象推理任务中具有显著优势，Vision ARC框架为ARC问题提供了有效的视觉解决方案

Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) is designed to promote research on abstract reasoning, a fundamental aspect of human intelligence. Common approaches to ARC treat it as a language-oriented problem, addressed by large language models (LLMs) or recurrent reasoning models. However, although the puzzle-like tasks in ARC are inherently visual, existing research has rarely approached the problem from a vision-centric perspective. In this work, we formulate ARC within a vision paradigm, framing it as an image-to-image translation problem. To incorporate visual priors, we represent the inputs on a "canvas" that can be processed like natural images. It is then natural for us to apply standard vision architectures, such as a vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT), to perform image-to-image mapping. Our model is trained from scratch solely on ARC data and generalizes to unseen tasks through test-time training. Our framework, termed Vision ARC (VARC), achieves 60.4% accuracy on the ARC-1 benchmark, substantially outperforming existing methods that are also trained from scratch. Our results are competitive with those of leading LLMs and close the gap to average human performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有WMH自动分割方法主要提供全局病灶负荷，忽略了在不同白质区域的空间分布信息，而区域WMH分布对认知老化和神经退行性疾病有重要诊断价值。

Method: 使用深度学习框架进行稳健的WMH分割和定位，在公共数据集和ADNI队列中评估，量化解剖定义区域内的WMH负荷，并结合脑结构体积评估诊断价值。

Result: 预测病灶负荷与参考WMH估计一致，区域WMH体积在疾病分类中始终优于全局病灶负担，结合脑萎缩指标后AUC可达0.97，前部白质束等特定区域与AD诊断状态可重复相关。

Conclusion: 区域WMH量化具有附加价值，将局部病灶指标与萎缩标志物结合可增强神经退行性疾病的早期诊断和分层能力。

Abstract: White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are key imaging markers in cognitive aging, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and related dementias. Although automated methods for WMH segmentation have advanced, most provide only global lesion load and overlook their spatial distribution across distinct white matter regions. We propose a deep learning framework for robust WMH segmentation and localization, evaluated across public datasets and an independent Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Our results show that the predicted lesion loads are in line with the reference WMH estimates, confirming the robustness to variations in lesion load, acquisition, and demographics. Beyond accurate segmentation, we quantify WMH load within anatomically defined regions and combine these measures with brain structure volumes to assess diagnostic value. Regional WMH volumes consistently outperform global lesion burden for disease classification, and integration with brain atrophy metrics further improves performance, reaching area under the curve (AUC) values up to 0.97. Several spatially distinct regions, particularly within anterior white matter tracts, are reproducibly associated with diagnostic status, indicating localized vulnerability in AD. These results highlight the added value of regional WMH quantification. Incorporating localized lesion metrics alongside atrophy markers may enhance early diagnosis and stratification in neurodegenerative disorders.

The result clusters can be visualised not only to understand the model, but also to increase confidence in its operation, leading to faster adoption in clinical practice. We also evaluate the performance of our technique on an existing model for detecting prostate cancer, demonstrating its usefulness.

Abstract: The accurate segmentation of brain tumors from multi-modal MRI is critical for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. While integrating complementary information from various MRI sequences is a common practice, the frequent absence of one or more modalities in real-world clinical settings poses a significant challenge, severely compromising the performance and generalizability of deep learning-based segmentation models. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Cross-Modal Compositional Self-Distillation (CCSD) framework that can flexibly handle arbitrary combinations of input modalities. CCSD adopts a shared-specific encoder-decoder architecture and incorporates two self-distillation strategies: (i) a hierarchical modality self-distillation mechanism that transfers knowledge across modality hierarchies to reduce semantic discrepancies, and (ii) a progressive modality combination distillation approach that enhances robustness to missing modalities by simulating gradual modality dropout during training. Extensive experiments on public brain tumor segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that CCSD achieves state-of-the-art performance across various missing-modality scenarios, with strong generalization and stability.

Result: 实现3.42倍推理加速和1.4倍内存减少，优于其他顶级方法，同时保持性能且无需训练。

Abstract: Omnimodal large language models (OmniLLMs) have attracted increasing research attention of late towards unified audio-video understanding, wherein processing audio-video token sequences creates a significant computational bottleneck, however. Existing token compression methods have yet to accommodate this emerging need of jointly compressing multimodal tokens. To bridge this gap, we present OmniZip, a training-free, audio-guided audio-visual token-compression framework that optimizes multimodal token representation and accelerates inference. Specifically, OmniZip first identifies salient audio tokens, then computes an audio retention score for each time group to capture information density, thereby dynamically guiding video token pruning and preserving cues from audio anchors enhanced by cross-modal similarity. For each time window, OmniZip compresses the video tokens using an interleaved spatio-temporal scheme. Extensive empirical results demonstrate the merits of OmniZip - it achieves 3.42X inference speedup and 1.4X memory reduction over other top-performing counterparts, while maintaining performance with no training.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease is essential for early stratification and personalized management. While tabular predictors provide robust markers of global risk, their ability to capture subtle brain changes remains limited. In this study, we evaluate the predictive contributions of tabular and imaging-based representations, with a focus on transformer-derived Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) embeddings. We introduce a trajectory-aware labeling strategy based on Dynamic Time Warping clustering to capture heterogeneous patterns of cognitive change, and train a 3D Vision Transformer (ViT) via unsupervised reconstruction on harmonized and augmented MRI data to obtain anatomy-preserving embeddings without progression labels. The pretrained encoder embeddings are subsequently assessed using both traditional machine learning classifiers and deep learning heads, and compared against tabular representations and convolutional network baselines. Results highlight complementary strengths across modalities. Clinical and volumetric features achieved the highest AUCs of around 0.70 for predicting mild and severe progression, underscoring their utility in capturing global decline trajectories. In contrast, MRI embeddings from the ViT model were most effective in distinguishing cognitively stable individuals with an AUC of 0.71. However, all approaches struggled in the heterogeneous moderate group. These findings indicate that clinical features excel in identifying high-risk extremes, whereas transformer-based MRI embeddings are more sensitive to subtle markers of stability, motivating multimodal fusion strategies for AD progression modeling.

Abstract: Poor bone health is a significant public health concern, and low bone mineral density (BMD) leads to an increased fracture risk, a key feature of osteoporosis. We present XAttn-BMD (Cross-Attention BMD), a multimodal deep learning framework that predicts femoral neck BMD from hip X-ray images and structured clinical metadata. It utilizes a novel bidirectional cross-attention mechanism to dynamically integrate image and metadata features for cross-modal mutual reinforcement. A Weighted Smooth L1 loss is tailored to address BMD imbalance and prioritize clinically significant cases. Extensive experiments on the data from the Hertfordshire Cohort Study show that our model outperforms the baseline models in regression generalization and robustness. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of both cross-attention fusion and the customized loss function. Experimental results show that the integration of multimodal data via cross-attention outperforms naive feature concatenation without cross-attention, reducing MSE by 16.7%, MAE by 6.03%, and increasing the R2 score by 16.4%, highlighting the effectiveness of the approach for femoral neck BMD estimation. Furthermore, screening performance was evaluated using binary classification at clinically relevant femoral neck BMD thresholds, demonstrating the model's potential in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: A scalable and robust 3D tissue transcriptomics profile can enable a holistic understanding of tissue organization and provide deeper insights into human biology and disease. Most predictive algorithms that infer ST directly from histology treat each section independently and ignore 3D structure, while existing 3D-aware approaches are not generative and do not scale well. We present Holographic Tissue Expression Inpainting and Analysis (HoloTea), a 3D-aware flow-matching framework that imputes spot-level gene expression from H&E while explicitly using information from adjacent sections. Our key idea is to retrieve morphologically corresponding spots on neighboring slides in a shared feature space and fuse this cross section context into a lightweight ControlNet, allowing conditioning to follow anatomical continuity. To better capture the count nature of the data, we introduce a 3D-consistent prior for flow matching that combines a learned zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) prior with a spatial-empirical prior constructed from neighboring sections. A global attention block introduces 3D H&E scaling linearly with the number of spots in the slide, enabling training and inference on large 3D ST datasets. Across three spatial transcriptomics datasets spanning different tissue types and resolutions, HoloTea consistently improves 3D expression accuracy and generalization compared to 2D and 3D baselines. We envision HoloTea advancing the creation of accurate 3D virtual tissues, ultimately accelerating biomarker discovery and deepening our understanding of disease.

TL;DR: 提出BioST-GCN模型用于基于视觉的跌倒预测，结合姿态和生物力学信息，在模拟数据上表现良好但存在模拟-现实差距问题。


<details>

Motivation: 跌倒对老年人造成严重伤害，基于视觉的跌倒预测系统因缺乏真实跌倒数据而发展受限。

Method: 提出双流模型BioST-GCN，使用交叉注意力融合机制结合姿态和生物力学信息。

Result: 在模拟数据集上比基线ST-GCN提升5.32%和2.91% F1分数，但零样本泛化到未见受试者时性能降至35.9%。

Conclusion: 需要弥合模拟与现实数据之间的差距，通过个性化策略和隐私保护数据管道来开发有效的老年人跌倒预测系统。

Abstract: Falls are a leading cause of injury and loss of independence among older adults. Vision-based fall prediction systems offer a non-invasive solution to anticipate falls seconds before impact, but their development is hindered by the scarcity of available fall data. Contributing to these efforts, this study proposes the Biomechanical Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (BioST-GCN), a dual-stream model that combines both pose and biomechanical information using a cross-attention fusion mechanism. Our model outperforms the vanilla ST-GCN baseline by 5.32% and 2.91% F1-score on the simulated MCF-UA stunt-actor and MUVIM datasets, respectively. The spatio-temporal attention mechanisms in the ST-GCN stream also provide interpretability by identifying critical joints and temporal phases. However, a critical simulation-reality gap persists. While our model achieves an 89.0% F1-score with full supervision on simulated data, zero-shot generalization to unseen subjects drops to 35.9%. This performance decline is likely due to biases in simulated data, such as `intent-to-fall' cues. For older adults, particularly those with diabetes or frailty, this gap is exacerbated by their unique kinematic profiles. To address this, we propose personalization strategies and advocate for privacy-preserving data pipelines to enable real-world validation. Our findings underscore the urgent need to bridge the gap between simulated and real-world data to develop effective fall prediction systems for vulnerable elderly populations.

Abstract: Doppler holography is an emerging retinal imaging technique that captures the dynamic behavior of blood flow with high temporal resolution, enabling quantitative assessment of retinal hemodynamics. This requires accurate segmentation of retinal arteries and veins, but traditional segmentation methods focus solely on spatial information and overlook the temporal richness of holographic data. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective approach for artery-vein segmentation in temporal Doppler holograms using standard segmentation architectures. By incorporating features derived from a dedicated pulse analysis pipeline, our method allows conventional U-Nets to exploit temporal dynamics and achieve performance comparable to more complex attention- or iteration-based models. These findings demonstrate that time-resolved preprocessing can unlock the full potential of deep learning for Doppler holography, opening new perspectives for quantitative exploration of retinal hemodynamics.

Result: 在DTU、BlendedMVS和Mip-NeRF360数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在稀疏视图场景下重建更准确和详细的表面，同时保持高质量的新视图渲染性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in optimizing Gaussian Splatting for scene geometry have enabled efficient reconstruction of detailed surfaces from images. However, when input views are sparse, such optimization is prone to overfitting, leading to suboptimal reconstruction quality. Existing approaches address this challenge by employing flattened Gaussian primitives to better fit surface geometry, combined with depth regularization to alleviate geometric ambiguities under limited viewpoints. Nevertheless, the increased anisotropy inherent in flattened Gaussians exacerbates overfitting in sparse-view scenarios, hindering accurate surface fitting and degrading novel view synthesis performance. In this paper, we propose \net{}, a method that reconstructs more accurate and detailed surfaces while preserving high-quality novel view rendering. Our key insight is to introduce Stereo Geometry-Texture Alignment, which bridges rendering quality and geometry estimation, thereby jointly enhancing both surface reconstruction and view synthesis. In addition, we present a Pseudo-Feature Enhanced Geometry Consistency that enforces multi-view geometric consistency by incorporating both training and unseen views, effectively mitigating overfitting caused by sparse supervision. Extensive experiments on the DTU, BlendedMVS, and Mip-NeRF360 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 计算细胞学面临两个主要挑战：实例级标签不可靠且获取成本高，阳性样本率极低（0.5%-10%）。需要开发能在低阳性率下稳定学习的预训练方法。

Method: SLAM-AGS框架联合优化弱监督相似性目标（在阴性样本上）和自监督对比目标（在阳性样本上），使用自适应梯度手术解决任务梯度冲突，集成到基于注意力的多实例学习聚合器中。

Result: 在骨髓细胞学数据集上，SLAM-AGS在袋级F1分数和Top 400阳性细胞检索方面优于其他预训练方法，在低阳性率下提升最显著。

Conclusion: 解决梯度干扰能够实现稳定预训练并在下游任务中获得更好性能，特别是在低阳性率场景下。开源实现促进可复现性。

Abstract: Computational cytology faces two major challenges: i) instance-level labels are unreliable and prohibitively costly to obtain, ii) witness rates are extremely low. We propose SLAM-AGS, a Slide-Label-Aware Multitask pretraining framework that jointly optimizes (i) a weakly supervised similarity objective on slide-negative patches and (ii) a self-supervised contrastive objective on slide-positive patches, yielding stronger performance on downstream tasks. To stabilize learning, we apply Adaptive Gradient Surgery to tackle conflicting task gradients and prevent model collapse. We integrate the pretrained encoder into an attention-based Multiple Instance Learning aggregator for bag-level prediction and attention-guided retrieval of the most abnormal instances in a bag. On a publicly available bone-marrow cytology dataset, with simulated witness rates from 10% down to 0.5%, SLAM-AGS improves bag-level F1-Score and Top 400 positive cell retrieval over other pretraining methods, with the largest gains at low witness rates, showing that resolving gradient interference enables stable pretraining and better performance on downstream tasks. To facilitate reproducibility, we share our complete implementation and evaluation framework as open source: https://github.com/Ace95/SLAM-AGS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 年龄验证中使用的输入图像分辨率差异很大，需要研究分辨率对年龄估计准确性的具体影响。

Method: 使用IMDB-Clean数据集的1000张图像，在7种不同分辨率下处理成7000个测试样本，使用MAE、SD和MedAE评估DeepFace和InsightFace的性能。

Result: 224x224像素分辨率下性能最佳，DeepFace MAE为10.83年，InsightFace MAE为7.46年。低分辨率时MAE显著增加，过高分辨率也会降低准确性。InsightFace在所有分辨率下都比DeepFace更快。

Conclusion: 输入图像分辨率对年龄估计准确性有明确且一致的影响，224x224像素是最佳分辨率，InsightFace在准确性和速度上都优于DeepFace。

Abstract: Automatic age estimation is widely used for age verification, where input images often vary considerably in resolution. This study evaluates the effect of image resolution on age estimation accuracy using DeepFace and InsightFace. A total of 1000 images from the IMDB-Clean dataset were processed in seven resolutions, resulting in 7000 test samples. Performance was evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Standard Deviation (SD), and Median Absolute Error (MedAE). Based on this study, we conclude that input image resolution has a clear and consistent impact on the accuracy of age estimation in both DeepFace and InsightFace. Both frameworks achieve optimal performance at 224x224 pixels, with an MAE of 10.83 years (DeepFace) and 7.46 years (InsightFace). At low resolutions, MAE increases substantially, while very high resolutions also degrade accuracy. InsightFace is consistently faster than DeepFace across all resolutions.

Motivation: 手动标注气道不切实际，现有U-Net方法会产生不连续组件，影响生物标志物提取的可靠性。

Method: 三阶段框架：1) nnU-Net生成初始气道掩码；2) 基于骨架的算法识别潜在不连续性并提出重新连接；3) 1D卷积分类器确定真实解剖分支与虚假路径。

Result: 在ATM'22和AeroPath两个数据集上，RepAir在体素级和拓扑指标上均优于现有3D U-Net方法，生成更完整的气道树结构。

Conclusion: RepAir框架能够产生更完整和解剖学一致的气道分割结果，同时保持高分割精度。

Abstract: Accurate airway segmentation from chest computed tomography (CT) scans is essential for quantitative lung analysis, yet manual annotation is impractical and many automated U-Net-based methods yield disconnected components that hinder reliable biomarker extraction. We present RepAir, a three-stage framework for robust 3D airway segmentation that combines an nnU-Net-based network with anatomically informed topology correction. The segmentation network produces an initial airway mask, after which a skeleton-based algorithm identifies potential discontinuities and proposes reconnections. A 1D convolutional classifier then determines which candidate links correspond to true anatomical branches versus false or obstructed paths. We evaluate RepAir on two distinct datasets: ATM'22, comprising annotated CT scans from predominantly healthy subjects and AeroPath, encompassing annotated scans with severe airway pathology. Across both datasets, RepAir outperforms existing 3D U-Net-based approaches such as Bronchinet and NaviAirway on both voxel-level and topological metrics, and produces more complete and anatomically consistent airway trees while maintaining high segmentation accuracy.

Result: 在临床数据集上评估，相比最先进的仅图像基线(nnU-Net)，疤痕平均Dice分数从0.6149提升到0.8463，精确度0.9115，灵敏度0.9043。

Conclusion: 整合生理学和解剖学知识使模型能够"超越图像观察"，为稳健且生理学基础的心脏疤痕分割设定了新方向。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of myocardial scar from late gadolinium enhanced (LGE) cardiac MRI is essential for evaluating tissue viability, yet remains challenging due to variable contrast and imaging artifacts. Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals provide complementary physiological information, as conduction abnormalities can help localize or suggest scarred myocardial regions. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal framework that integrates ECG-derived electrophysiological information with anatomical priors from the AHA-17 atlas for physiologically consistent LGE-based scar segmentation. As ECGs and LGE-MRIs are not acquired simultaneously, we introduce a Temporal Aware Feature Fusion (TAFF) mechanism that dynamically weights and fuses features based on their acquisition time difference. Our method was evaluated on a clinical dataset and achieved substantial gains over the state-of-the-art image-only baseline (nnU-Net), increasing the average Dice score for scars from 0.6149 to 0.8463 and achieving high performance in both precision (0.9115) and sensitivity (0.9043). These results show that integrating physiological and anatomical knowledge allows the model to "see beyond the image", setting a new direction for robust and physiologically grounded cardiac scar segmentation.

Motivation: 现有方法在增强合成视频真实感时难以保持原始视频的结构和语义一致性，需要一种既能提升真实感又能保持结构一致性的方法。

Result: 在实验中优于现有基线方法，在保持最先进真实感质量的同时，与原始视频的结构一致性更好。

Conclusion: 该方法是一种简单通用且强大的合成视频真实感增强方法，能有效平衡真实感和结构一致性。

Abstract: We propose an approach to enhancing synthetic video realism, which can re-render synthetic videos from a simulator in photorealistic fashion. Our realism enhancement approach is a zero-shot framework that focuses on preserving the multi-level structures from synthetic videos into the enhanced one in both spatial and temporal domains, built upon a diffusion video foundational model without further fine-tuning. Specifically, we incorporate an effective modification to have the generation/denoising process conditioned on estimated structure-aware information from the synthetic video, such as depth maps, semantic maps, and edge maps, by an auxiliary model, rather than extracting the information from a simulator. This guidance ensures that the enhanced videos are consistent with the original synthetic video at both the structural and semantic levels. Our approach is a simple yet general and powerful approach to enhancing synthetic video realism: we show that our approach outperforms existing baselines in structural consistency with the original video while maintaining state-of-the-art photorealism quality in our experiments.

Motivation: 现代基于Transformer的视频生成器中注意力机制的二次时间和内存复杂度使得超高清视频的端到端训练成本过高，因此需要无需额外训练即可生成更高分辨率视频的方法。

Method: 采用向内滑动窗口注意力机制，并设计双路径管道，通过交叉注意力覆盖策略让局部注意力产生的语义内容受到具有完整感受野分支的引导，同时使用交叉注意力缓存策略提高效率。

Result: 实验表明该方法能够以无需训练的方式生成具有精细视觉细节的超高清视频，在VBench上表现优于基于训练的方法，且具有竞争力或更高的效率。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了无需训练即可生成高质量超高清视频的目标，在保持视觉保真度和细节的同时确保了全局一致性，且效率优越。

Abstract: The quadratic time and memory complexity of the attention mechanism in modern Transformer based video generators makes end-to-end training for ultra high resolution videos prohibitively expensive. Motivated by this limitation, we introduce a training-free approach that leverages video Diffusion Transformers pretrained at their native scale to synthesize higher resolution videos without any additional training or adaptation. At the core of our method lies an inward sliding window attention mechanism, which originates from a key observation: maintaining each query token's training scale receptive field is crucial for preserving visual fidelity and detail. However, naive local window attention, unfortunately, often leads to repetitive content and exhibits a lack of global coherence in the generated results. To overcome this challenge, we devise a dual-path pipeline that backs up window attention with a novel cross-attention override strategy, enabling the semantic content produced by local attention to be guided by another branch with a full receptive field and, therefore, ensuring holistic consistency. Furthermore, to improve efficiency, we incorporate a cross-attention caching strategy for this branch to avoid the frequent computation of full 3D attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method delivers ultra-high-resolution videos with fine-grained visual details and high efficiency in a training-free paradigm. Meanwhile, it achieves superior performance on VBench, even compared to training-based alternatives, with competitive or improved efficiency.

Motivation: 标准潜在扩散模型的三组件架构计算效率低、性能次优，且无法与视觉基础模型的单网络架构统一。目标是统一这三个组件为单一端到端可训练网络。

Method: 提出扩散作为自蒸馏(DSD)框架，通过修改训练目标来稳定潜在空间，实现编码、解码和扩散的端到端联合训练。

Result: 在ImageNet 256×256条件生成任务上取得优异性能：FID=13.44/6.38/4.25（参数量42M/118M/205M，50训练轮次），无需分类器引导。

Conclusion: DSD首次实现了单一网络的稳定端到端训练，同时学习编码、解码和扩散，性能优异。

Abstract: Standard Latent Diffusion Models rely on a complex, three-part architecture consisting of a separate encoder, decoder, and diffusion network, which are trained in multiple stages. This modular design is computationally inefficient, leads to suboptimal performance, and prevents the unification of diffusion with the single-network architectures common in vision foundation models. Our goal is to unify these three components into a single, end-to-end trainable network. We first demonstrate that a naive joint training approach fails catastrophically due to ``latent collapse'', where the diffusion training objective interferes with the network's ability to learn a good latent representation. We identify the root causes of this instability by drawing a novel analogy between diffusion and self-distillation based unsupervised learning method. Based on this insight, we propose Diffusion as Self-Distillation (DSD), a new framework with key modifications to the training objective that stabilize the latent space. This approach enables, for the first time, the stable end-to-end training of a single network that simultaneously learns to encode, decode, and perform diffusion. DSD achieves outstanding performance on the ImageNet $256\times 256$ conditional generation task: FID=13.44/6.38/4.25 with only 42M/118M/205M parameters and 50 training epochs on ImageNet, without using classifier-free-guidance.

Abstract: Engagement recognition in video datasets, unlike traditional image classification tasks, is particularly challenged by subjective labels and noise limiting model performance. To overcome the challenges of subjective and noisy engagement labels, we propose a framework leveraging Vision Large Language Models (VLMs) to refine annotations and guide the training process. Our framework uses a questionnaire to extract behavioral cues and split data into high- and low-reliability subsets. We also introduce a training strategy combining curriculum learning with soft label refinement, gradually incorporating ambiguous samples while adjusting supervision to reflect uncertainty. We demonstrate that classical computer vision models trained on refined high-reliability subsets and enhanced with our curriculum strategy show improvements, highlighting benefits of addressing label subjectivity with VLMs. This method surpasses prior state of the art across engagement benchmarks such as EngageNet (three of six feature settings, maximum improvement of +1.21%), and DREAMS / PAFE with F1 gains of +0.22 / +0.06.

Abstract: We propose Confidence-Guided Token Merging (Co-Me), an acceleration mechanism for visual geometric transformers without retraining or finetuning the base model. Co-Me distilled a light-weight confidence predictor to rank tokens by uncertainty and selectively merge low-confidence ones, effectively reducing computation while maintaining spatial coverage. Compared to similarity-based merging or pruning, the confidence signal in Co-Me reliably indicates regions emphasized by the transformer, enabling substantial acceleration without degrading performance. Co-Me applies seamlessly to various multi-view and streaming visual geometric transformers, achieving speedups that scale with sequence length. When applied to VGGT and MapAnything, Co-Me achieves up to $11.3\times$ and $7.2\times$ speedup, making visual geometric transformers practical for real-time 3D perception and reconstruction.

Result: 水印技术能够保持语义，但会偏离未加水印文本的写作风格，并且容易受到对抗攻击，特别是回译攻击。

Conclusion: 现有水印技术在保持语义方面表现良好，但在写作风格保持和对抗攻击鲁棒性方面存在不足，需要进一步改进以促进其广泛应用。

Abstract: To mitigate the potential harms of Large Language Models (LLMs)generated text, researchers have proposed watermarking, a process of embedding detectable signals within text. With watermarking, we can always accurately detect LLM-generated texts. However, recent findings suggest that these techniques often negatively affect the quality of the generated texts, and adversarial attacks can strip the watermarking signals, causing the texts to possibly evade detection. These findings have created resistance in the wide adoption of watermarking by LLM creators. Finally, to encourage adoption, we evaluate the robustness of several watermarking techniques to adversarial attacks by comparing paraphrasing and back translation (i.e., English $\to$ another language $\to$ English) attacks; and their ability to preserve quality and writing style of the unwatermarked texts by using linguistic metrics to capture quality and writing style of texts. Our results suggest that these watermarking techniques preserve semantics, deviate from the writing style of the unwatermarked texts, and are susceptible to adversarial attacks, especially for the back translation attack.

RT canbe seen as a test-time inference method.

### [139] [Can QE-informed (Re)Translation lead to Error Correction?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13884)
*Govardhan Padmanabhan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种无需训练的QE-informed错误校正方法：一种是选择多个LLM生成候选中质量最高的翻译，另一种是基于QE解释替换错误子串。第一种方法在WMT 2025任务中获胜。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然联合训练QE和APE系统能提升性能，但APE系统存在过度校正问题，导致性能下降。本文研究无需训练的简单方法来避免这个问题。

Method: 提出两种无需训练的方法：1）QE-informed重翻译：从不同LLM生成的多个候选中选择质量最高的翻译；2）基于QE解释的错误替换：根据提供的QE解释替换错误子串，采用条件启发式最小化编辑次数。

Result: 两种方法的Delta COMET得分分别为0.0201和-0.0108，第一种方法在子任务排行榜上获得获胜位置。

Conclusion: 无需训练的QE-informed重翻译方法在机器翻译错误校正任务中表现优于基于QE解释的错误替换方法，证明了简单选择策略的有效性。

Abstract: The paper presents two approaches submitted to the WMT 2025 Automated Translation Quality Evaluation Systems Task 3 - Quality Estimation (QE)-informed Segment-level Error Correction. While jointly training QE systems with Automatic Post-Editing (APE) has shown improved performance for both tasks, APE systems are still known to overcorrect the output of Machine Translation (MT), leading to a degradation in performance. We investigate a simple training-free approach - QE-informed Retranslation, and compare it with another within the same training-free paradigm. Our winning approach selects the highest-quality translation from multiple candidates generated by different LLMs. The second approach, more akin to APE, instructs an LLM to replace error substrings as specified in the provided QE explanation(s). A conditional heuristic was employed to minimise the number of edits, with the aim of maximising the Gain-to-Edit ratio. The two proposed approaches achieved a Delta COMET score of 0.0201 and -0.0108, respectively, leading the first approach to achieve the winning position on the subtask leaderboard.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在检索应用中难以有效利用长距离上下文的"迷失在中间"现象，特别是在控制变量检索任务中的性能问题。

Method: 提出GM-Extract基准数据集，使用文档指标和变量提取指标双评估系统，系统评估7-8B参数模型在多文档任务中的表现，并进行文献调查将缓解方法分为黑盒和白盒两类进行测试。

Result: 发现仅通过改变数据在上下文窗口中的表示方式就能显著影响检索性能，虽然未观察到明显的U形曲线，但模型表现呈现清晰模式且与困惑度相关。缓解方法的效果具有高度细微差异，有些能提升性能，有些反而产生负面影响。

Conclusion: 在现实应用场景中，缓解"迷失在中间"现象的方法需要谨慎选择和评估，其效果高度依赖于具体情境，为实际应用提供了全面的理解。

Abstract: The diminishing ability of large language models (LLMs) to effectively utilize long-range context-the "lost-in-the-middle" phenomenon-poses a significant challenge in retrieval-based LLM applications. To study the impact of this phenomenon in a real-world application setting, we introduce GM-Extract, a novel benchmark dataset meticulously designed to evaluate LLM performance on retrieval of control variables. To accurately diagnose failure modes, we propose a simple yet elegant evaluation system using two distinct metrics: one for spatial retrieval capability (Document Metric) and the other for semantic retrieval capability (Variable Extraction Metric). We conduct a systematic evaluation of 7-8B parameter models on two multi-document tasks (key-value extraction and question-answering), demonstrating a significant change in retrieval performance simply by altering how the data is represented in the context window. While a distinct U-shaped curve was not consistently observed, our analysis reveals a clear pattern of performance across models, which we further correlate with perplexity scores. Furthermore, we perform a literature survey of mitigation methods, which we categorize into two distinct approaches: black-box and white-box methods. We then apply these techniques to our benchmark, finding that their efficacy is highly nuanced. Our evaluation highlights scenarios where these strategies successfully improve performance, as well as surprising cases where they lead to a negative impact, providing a comprehensive understanding of their utility in a practical context.

TL;DR: LLM框架解析电商查询中的最高级语义，通过提取结构化提示来改进搜索性能，同时解决延迟问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电商搜索中带有最高级的查询需要多维度比较候选商品，需要语言理解和领域知识

Method: 将查询分解为属性-值提示，与检索并行生成，然后将最高级解释转移到轻量级模型

Result: 搜索性能提升10.9个MAP点，排名提升5.9个MRR点

Conclusion: 该方法展示了如何在检索系统中表示和传递最高级语义，同时解决实际部署约束

Abstract: Search queries with superlatives (e.g., best, most popular) require comparing candidates across multiple dimensions, demanding linguistic understanding and domain knowledge. We show that LLMs can uncover latent intent behind these expressions in e-commerce queries through a framework that extracts structured interpretations or hints. Our approach decomposes queries into attribute-value hints generated concurrently with retrieval, enabling efficient integration into the ranking pipeline. Our method improves search performanc eby 10.9 points in MAP and ranking by 5.9 points in MRR over baselines. Since direct LLM-based reranking faces prohibitive latency, we develop an efficient approach transferring superlative interpretations to lightweight models. Our findings provide insights into how superlative semantics can be represented and transferred between models, advancing linguistic interpretation in retrieval systems while addressing practical deployment constraints.

TL;DR: 提出了MoRA-RAG框架，通过混合检索和代理分块技术，将灾后勘察报告转化为结构化知识，用于多灾害推理，显著提升了LLM在灾害分析中的准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 灾后勘察报告包含理解多灾害相互作用的关键证据，但其非结构化叙述使得系统知识传递困难。LLMs在缺乏领域基础时会产生不可靠或幻觉输出。

Method: MoRA-RAG框架集成了混合检索机制，动态路由跨灾害特定数据库的查询，使用代理分块保持检索时的上下文连贯性，并包含验证循环来评估证据充分性、优化查询和在信息不完整时启动针对性搜索。

Result: MoRA-RAG在HazardRecQA数据集上达到94.5%的准确率，比零样本LLMs提升30%，比最先进的RAG系统提升10%，同时在不同LLM架构中减少幻觉。还使开源LLMs达到与专有模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: MoRA-RAG为将灾后文档转化为可操作、可信赖的灾害韧性智能建立了新范式。

Abstract: Post-disaster reconnaissance reports contain critical evidence for understanding multi-hazard interactions, yet their unstructured narratives make systematic knowledge transfer difficult. Large language models (LLMs) offer new potential for analyzing these reports, but often generate unreliable or hallucinated outputs when domain grounding is absent. This study introduces the Mixture-of-Retrieval Agentic RAG (MoRA-RAG), a knowledge-grounded LLM framework that transforms reconnaissance reports into a structured foundation for multi-hazard reasoning. The framework integrates a Mixture-of-Retrieval mechanism that dynamically routes queries across hazard-specific databases while using agentic chunking to preserve contextual coherence during retrieval. It also includes a verification loop that assesses evidence sufficiency, refines queries, and initiates targeted searches when information remains incomplete. We construct HazardRecQA by deriving question-answer pairs from GEER reconnaissance reports, which document 90 global events across seven major hazard types. MoRA-RAG achieves up to 94.5 percent accuracy, outperforming zero-shot LLMs by 30 percent and state-of-the-art RAG systems by 10 percent, while reducing hallucinations across diverse LLM architectures. MoRA-RAG also enables open-weight LLMs to achieve performance comparable to proprietary models. It establishes a new paradigm for transforming post-disaster documentation into actionable, trustworthy intelligence for hazard resilience.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OOC虚假信息检测方法过于关注内部一致性，忽视了图像-文本对与外部证据之间的外部一致性检查的重要性。

Method: HiEAG框架将外部一致性检查分解为检索、重排序和重写的综合引擎管道，使用AESP进行证据重排序，AEGP进行证据重写，并支持解释性判断。

Result: 在不同基准数据集上的实验结果表明，HiEAG在所有样本的准确率上超越了之前的最先进方法。

Conclusion: HiEAG通过分层证据增强生成有效提升了多模态OOC虚假信息检测的性能，证明了外部一致性检查的重要性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal out-of-context (OOC) misinformation detection have made remarkable progress in checking the consistencies between different modalities for supporting or refuting image-text pairs. However, existing OOC misinformation detection methods tend to emphasize the role of internal consistency, ignoring the significant of external consistency between image-text pairs and external evidence. In this paper, we propose HiEAG, a novel Hierarchical Evidence-Augmented Generation framework to refine external consistency checking through leveraging the extensive knowledge of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our approach decomposes external consistency checking into a comprehensive engine pipeline, which integrates reranking and rewriting, apart from retrieval. Evidence reranking module utilizes Automatic Evidence Selection Prompting (AESP) that acquires the relevant evidence item from the products of evidence retrieval. Subsequently, evidence rewriting module leverages Automatic Evidence Generation Prompting (AEGP) to improve task adaptation on MLLM-based OOC misinformation detectors. Furthermore, our approach enables explanation for judgment, and achieves impressive performance with instruction tuning. Experimental results on different benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed HiEAG surpasses previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in the accuracy over all samples.

Motivation: 现有数据集如GoEmotions存在严重的类别不平衡问题，影响模型性能，特别是对代表性不足的情感类别

Method: 整合GoEmotions原始数据、使用RoBERTa-base-GoEmotions模型标注的Sentiment140样本和GPT-4 mini生成的人工标注文本，构建平衡数据集；开发结合FastText嵌入、CNN、双向LSTM和注意力机制的增强分类模型

Result: 相比在非平衡数据上训练的模型，在准确率、精确率、召回率、F1分数和AUC方面均有显著提升

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在多标签情感分类中有效，平衡数据集和增强模型架构的结合显著改善了分类性能

Abstract: Multi-label sentiment classification plays a vital role in natural language processing by detecting multiple emotions within a single text. However, existing datasets like GoEmotions often suffer from severe class imbalance, which hampers model performance, especially for underrepresented emotions. To address this, we constructed a balanced multi-label sentiment dataset by integrating the original GoEmotions data, emotion-labeled samples from Sentiment140 using a RoBERTa-base-GoEmotions model, and manually annotated texts generated by GPT-4 mini. Our data balancing strategy ensured an even distribution across 28 emotion categories. Based on this dataset, we developed an enhanced multi-label classification model that combines pre-trained FastText embeddings, convolutional layers for local feature extraction, bidirectional LSTM for contextual learning, and an attention mechanism to highlight sentiment-relevant words. A sigmoid-activated output layer enables multi-label prediction, and mixed precision training improves computational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC compared to models trained on imbalanced data, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RVLMs依赖安全对齐防止有害行为，但其暴露的思维链轨迹引入了新的攻击面。研究发现这些模型的安全对齐容易被突破。

Method: 通过段级干扰引发有害推理轨迹，将自生成输出作为监督微调数据，采用轮次加权损失设计实现轻量级、分布一致的微调方法。

Result: 仅用499个样本和单张A100显卡3小时内，攻击成功率比IDEATOR提高38.52%，同时保持通用推理能力，模型表示分布保持不变。

Conclusion: Stealth Fine-Tuning是一种低成本、高效绕过对齐防御的方法，在AdvBench和多个通用基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: Reasoning-augmented Vision-Language Models (RVLMs) rely on safety alignment to prevent harmful behavior, yet their exposed chain-of-thought (CoT) traces introduce new attack surfaces. In this work, we find that the safety alignment of RVLMs can be easily break through a novel attack method termed \textbf{Stealth Fine-Tuning}. Our method elicits harmful reasoning traces through \textbf{segment-level interference} and reuses the self-generated outputs as supervised fine-tuning data. Through a \textbf{turn-based weighted} loss design, yielding a lightweight, distribution-consistent finetuning method. In our experiment, with only 499 samples and under 3 hours on a single A100 (QLoRA), Stealth Fine-Tuning outperforms IDEATOR by 38.52\% ASR while preserving general reasoning ability, as the tuned model retains the original representation distribution. Experiments on AdvBench and several general benchmarks demonstrate that Stealth Fine-Tuning is a low-cost and highly effective way to bypass alignment defenses. \textcolor{red}{\textbf{Disclaimer: This paper contains content that may be disturbing or offensive.}}

TL;DR: 提出了一种数据中心的框架，通过生成高质量合成出院摘要来解决ICD编码中的长尾分布问题，改善了罕见和零样本ICD代码的预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床文本自动ICD编码面临极端长尾分布的挑战，数千个罕见和零样本ICD代码在MIMIC-III等数据集中代表性不足，导致宏观F1分数较低。

Method: 构建基于真实世界共现模式、ICD描述、同义词、分类法和相似临床笔记的结构化提示，生成90,000个合成笔记覆盖7,902个ICD代码，显著扩展训练分布。对PLM-ICD和GKI-ICD两个最先进的基于transformer的模型进行微调。

Result: 实验表明该方法适度提高了宏观F1分数，同时保持了强大的微观F1分数，优于之前的SOTA方法。

Conclusion: 虽然相对于计算成本而言增益可能看起来有限，但结果表明精心设计的合成数据可以增强长尾ICD代码预测的公平性。

Abstract: Automatic ICD coding from clinical text is a critical task in medical NLP but remains hindered by the extreme long-tail distribution of diagnostic codes. Thousands of rare and zero-shot ICD codes are severely underrepresented in datasets like MIMIC-III, leading to low macro-F1 scores. In this work, we propose a data-centric framework that generates high-quality synthetic discharge summaries to mitigate this imbalance. Our method constructs realistic multi-label code sets anchored on rare codes by leveraging real-world co-occurrence patterns, ICD descriptions, synonyms, taxonomy, and similar clinical notes. Using these structured prompts, we generate 90,000 synthetic notes covering 7,902 ICD codes, significantly expanding the training distribution. We fine-tune two state-of-the-art transformer-based models, PLM-ICD and GKI-ICD, on both the original and extended datasets. Experiments show that our approach modestly improves macro-F1 while maintaining strong micro-F1, outperforming prior SOTA. While the gain may seem marginal relative to the computational cost, our results demonstrate that carefully crafted synthetic data can enhance equity in long-tail ICD code prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于图的方法只能建模成对依赖关系，需要为不同关系视图构建多个图，导致冗余、参数开销和融合时的错误传播，在短文本、低资源场景下鲁棒性不足。

Method: 提出动态超图框架，通过新颖的加速-回退截止策略进行层次聚类，自适应确定粒度级别，构建样本特定的方面-观点结构。

Result: 在三个基准数据集(Lap14, Rest14, MAMS)上的实验显示，相比强图基线方法取得一致改进，特别是与RoBERTa骨干网络结合时获得显著提升。

Conclusion: 动态超图构建为ABSA提供了一种高效强大的替代方案，并有潜力扩展到其他短文本NLP任务。

Abstract: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) predicts sentiment polarity for specific aspect terms, a task made difficult by conflicting sentiments across aspects and the sparse context of short texts. Prior graph-based approaches model only pairwise dependencies, forcing them to construct multiple graphs for different relational views. These introduce redundancy, parameter overhead, and error propagation during fusion, limiting robustness in short-text, low-resource settings. We present HyperABSA, a dynamic hypergraph framework that induces aspect-opinion structures through sample-specific hierarchical clustering. To construct these hyperedges, we introduce a novel acceleration-fallback cutoff for hierarchical clustering, which adaptively determines the level of granularity. Experiments on three benchmarks (Lap14, Rest14, MAMS) show consistent improvements over strong graph baselines, with substantial gains when paired with RoBERTa backbones. These results position dynamic hypergraph construction as an efficient, powerful alternative for ABSA, with potential extensions to other short-text NLP tasks.

Conclusion: 通过结合动态生成的知识图谱和事实验证，实现了可追溯的多选题回答系统，展示了关系抽取在知识表示和推理中的潜力

Abstract: In this research, we combine Transformer-based relation extraction with matching of knowledge graphs (KGs) and apply them to answering multiple-choice questions (MCQs) while maintaining the traceability of the output process. KGs are structured representations of factual knowledge consisting of entities and relations. Due to the high construction cost, they had been regarded as static databases with validated links. However, the recent development of Transformer-based relation extraction (RE) methods has enabled us to generate KGs dynamically by giving them natural language texts, and thereby opened the possibility for representing the meaning of the input sentences with the created KGs. Using this effect, we propose a method that answers MCQs in the "fill-in-the-blank" format, taking care of the point that RE methods generate KGs that represent false information if provided with factually incorrect texts. We measure the truthfulness of each question sentence by (i) converting the sentence into a relational graph using an RE method and (ii) verifying it against factually correct KGs under the closed-world assumption. The experimental results demonstrate that our method correctly answers up to around 70% of the questions, while providing traceability of the procedure. We also highlight that the question category has a vast influence on the accuracy.

Abstract: Future superhuman models will surpass the ability of humans and humans will only be able to \textit{weakly} supervise superhuman models. To alleviate the issue of lacking high-quality data for model alignment, some works on weak-to-strong generalization (W2SG) finetune a strong pretrained model with a weak supervisor so that it can generalize beyond weak supervision. However, the invariable use of weak supervision in existing methods exposes issues in robustness, with a proportion of weak labels proving harmful to models. In this paper, we propose a selective W2SG framework to avoid using weak supervision when unnecessary. We train a binary classifier P(IK) to identify questions that a strong model can answer and use its self-generated labels for alignment. We further refine weak labels with a graph smoothing method. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms competitive baselines. Further analyses show that P(IK) can generalize across tasks and difficulties, which indicates selective W2SG can help superalignment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了首个符号定位框架，利用符号语言学和语义知识来追踪大语言模型中幻觉在所有层的形成过程，发现幻觉本质上是符号语言处理失败而非一般生成问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在处理符号触发器（如修饰语、否定、数字、例外和命名实体）时仍存在幻觉问题，但缺乏对这些符号幻觉来源的清晰理解，需要系统性地处理这些触发器并定位幻觉在模型内部的产生位置。

Method: 提出符号定位框架，利用符号语言学和语义知识分析五个模型在HaluEval和TruthfulQA数据集上的表现，重点关注模型如何处理符号触发器。

Result: 发现符号语言元素的注意力方差在早期层（2-4）爆炸性增长到临界不稳定状态，否定触发灾难性方差水平；尽管模型规模增大，幻觉率仍保持高位（78.3%-83.7%），深层中符号语义触发器的注意力急剧下降。

Conclusion: 幻觉本质上是符号语言处理失败，而非一般生成问题，符号语义知识为理解和定位大语言模型中的幻觉机制提供了关键。

Abstract: LLMs still struggle with hallucination, especially when confronted with symbolic triggers like modifiers, negation, numbers, exceptions, and named entities. Yet, we lack a clear understanding of where these symbolic hallucinations originate, making it crucial to systematically handle such triggers and localize the emergence of hallucination inside the model. While prior work explored localization using statistical techniques like LSC and activation variance analysis, these methods treat all tokens equally and overlook the role symbolic linguistic knowledge plays in triggering hallucinations. So far, no approach has investigated how symbolic elements specifically drive hallucination failures across model layers, nor has symbolic linguistic knowledge been used as the foundation for a localization framework. We propose the first symbolic localization framework that leverages symbolic linguistic and semantic knowledge to meaningfully trace the development of hallucinations across all model layers. By focusing on how models process symbolic triggers, we analyze five models using HaluEval and TruthfulQA. Our symbolic knowledge approach reveals that attention variance for these linguistic elements explodes to critical instability in early layers (2-4), with negation triggering catastrophic variance levels, demonstrating that symbolic semantic processing breaks down from the very beginning. Through the lens of symbolic linguistic knowledge, despite larger model sizes, hallucination rates remain consistently high (78.3%-83.7% across Gemma variants), with steep attention drops for symbolic semantic triggers throughout deeper layers. Our findings demonstrate that hallucination is fundamentally a symbolic linguistic processing failure, not a general generation problem, revealing that symbolic semantic knowledge provides the key to understanding and localizing hallucination mechanisms in LLMs.

Abstract: Entity Linking (EL), the task of mapping textual entity mentions to their corresponding entries in knowledge bases, constitutes a fundamental component of natural language understanding. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential for enhancing EL performance. Prior research has leveraged LLMs to improve entity disambiguation and input representation, yielding significant gains in accuracy and robustness. However, these approaches typically apply LLMs to isolated stages of the EL task, failing to fully integrate their capabilities throughout the entire process.
  In this work, we introduce DeepEL, a comprehensive framework that incorporates LLMs into every stage of the entity linking task. Furthermore, we identify that disambiguating entities in isolation is insufficient for optimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel self-validation mechanism that utilizes global contextual information, enabling LLMs to rectify their own predictions and better recognize cohesive relationships among entities within the same sentence.
  Extensive empirical evaluation across ten benchmark datasets demonstrates that DeepEL substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average improvement of 2.6\% in overall F1 score and a remarkable 4% gain on out-of-domain datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了ArbESC+系统，这是首个阿拉伯语语法错误纠正的多系统方法，通过组合多个模型的特征并使用分类器选择最佳修正，在QALB数据集上取得了优于单一模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯语具有复杂的形态和句法结构，传统方法使用单一模型而忽略了组合不同系统的潜在优势，需要开发多系统方法来提升语法错误纠正效果。

Method: 使用AraT5、ByT5、mT5、AraBART等多个模型生成修正建议，将其表示为数值特征，通过分类器选择最佳修正，并采用支持技术过滤重叠修正和评估决策可靠性。

Result: 在QALB-14测试数据上F0.5达到82.63%，QALB-15 L1数据上84.64%，QALB-15 L2数据上65.55%，性能优于单一模型。

Conclusion: 这是首个集成语言错误纠正的阿拉伯语系统，为开发先进的阿拉伯语文本处理工具提供了实用步骤，将惠及阿拉伯语用户和研究者。

Abstract: Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) is an important aspect of natural language processing. Arabic has a complicated morphological and syntactic structure, posing a greater challenge than other languages. Even though modern neural models have improved greatly in recent years, the majority of previous attempts used individual models without taking into account the potential benefits of combining different systems. In this paper, we present one of the first multi-system approaches for correcting grammatical errors in Arabic, the Arab Enhanced Edit Selection System Complication (ArbESC+). Several models are used to collect correction proposals, which are represented as numerical features in the framework. A classifier determines and implements the appropriate corrections based on these features. In order to improve output quality, the framework uses support techniques to filter overlapping corrections and estimate decision reliability. A combination of AraT5, ByT5, mT5, AraBART, AraBART+Morph+GEC, and Text editing systems gave better results than a single model alone, with F0.5 at 82.63% on QALB-14 test data, 84.64% on QALB-15 L1 data, and 65.55% on QALB-15 L2 data. As one of the most significant contributions of this work, it's the first Arab attempt to integrate linguistic error correction. Improving existing models provides a practical step towards developing advanced tools that will benefit users and researchers of Arabic text processing.

Conclusion: 本工作同时推进了合适的语料库和训练目标，为音乐领域LLM提供了可扩展的数据训练框架和可复用的评估工具。

Abstract: Large language models perform strongly on general tasks but remain constrained in specialized settings such as music, particularly in the music-entertainment domain, where corpus scale, purity, and the match between data and training objectives are critical. We address this by constructing a large, music-related natural language corpus (40B tokens) that combines open source and in-house data, and by implementing a domain-first data pipeline: a lightweight classifier filters and weights in-domain text, followed by multi-stage cleaning, de-duplication, and privacy-preserving masking. We further integrate multi-source music text with associated metadata to form a broader, better-structured foundation of domain knowledge. On the training side, we introduce reference-model (RM)-based token-level soft scoring for quality control: a unified loss-ratio criterion is used both for data selection and for dynamic down-weighting during optimization, reducing noise gradients and amplifying task-aligned signals, thereby enabling more effective music-domain continued pretraining and alignment. To assess factuality, we design the MusicSimpleQA benchmark, which adopts short, single-answer prompts with automated agreement scoring. Beyond the benchmark design, we conduct systematic comparisons along the axes of data composition. Overall, this work advances both the right corpus and the right objective, offering a scalable data-training framework and a reusable evaluation tool for building domain LLMs in the music field.

Motivation: 现有电影配音方法简化了工作流程，忽略了导演与演员之间的关键交互，而真实工作流程中导演会指导演员内化情感线索

Method: 构建多模态参考片段库，使用情感相似性检索增强策略，开发渐进式图基语音生成方法，结合LLM进行深度情感理解

Result: 在V2C Animation基准数据集上，主观和客观评估均验证了有效性，在情感表现力方面实现全面改进

Conclusion: Authentic-Dubber成功复制了真实配音工作流程，显著提升了配音的情感表达质量

Abstract: The automatic movie dubbing model generates vivid speech from given scripts, replicating a speaker's timbre from a brief timbre prompt while ensuring lip-sync with the silent video. Existing approaches simulate a simplified workflow where actors dub directly without preparation, overlooking the critical director-actor interaction. In contrast, authentic workflows involve a dynamic collaboration: directors actively engage with actors, guiding them to internalize the context cues, specifically emotion, before performance. To address this issue, we propose a new Retrieve-Augmented Director-Actor Interaction Learning scheme to achieve authentic movie dubbing, termed Authentic-Dubber, which contains three novel mechanisms: (1) We construct a multimodal Reference Footage library to simulate the learning footage provided by directors. Note that we integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve deep comprehension of emotional representations across multimodal signals. (2) To emulate how actors efficiently and comprehensively internalize director-provided footage during dubbing, we propose an Emotion-Similarity-based Retrieval-Augmentation strategy. This strategy retrieves the most relevant multimodal information that aligns with the target silent video. (3) We develop a Progressive Graph-based speech generation approach that incrementally incorporates the retrieved multimodal emotional knowledge, thereby simulating the actor's final dubbing process. The above mechanisms enable the Authentic-Dubber to faithfully replicate the authentic dubbing workflow, achieving comprehensive improvements in emotional expressiveness. Both subjective and objective evaluations on the V2C Animation benchmark dataset validate the effectiveness. The code and demos are available at https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/Authentic-Dubber.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管语音AI技术快速发展，但缺乏针对非洲语言多样性的公开应用特定模型评估，需要为非洲用例提供合适的语音技术选择指导。

Method: 构建包含自发和非自发语音对话的综合评估套件，涵盖金融、法律、医疗等7个领域，对开源、闭源、单模态和多模态语音识别系统进行基准测试。

Result: 开源ASR在自发语音中表现良好但在嘈杂对话中退化；多模态LLM对口音更鲁棒但处理领域特定命名实体困难；专有模型在清晰语音中准确率高但随国家和领域变化显著；非洲英语微调模型在延迟和准确性方面具有竞争优势。

Conclusion: 该基准测试为从业者和研究人员提供了选择适合非洲用例的语音技术的工具，促进为服务不足社区开发包容性语音应用。

Abstract: Recent advances in speech-enabled AI, including Google's NotebookLM and OpenAI's speech-to-speech API, are driving widespread interest in voice interfaces globally. Despite this momentum, there exists no publicly available application-specific model evaluation that caters to Africa's linguistic diversity. We present AfriSpeech-MultiBench, the first domain-specific evaluation suite for over 100 African English accents across 10+ countries and seven application domains: Finance, Legal, Medical, General dialogue, Call Center, Named Entities and Hallucination Robustness. We benchmark a diverse range of open, closed, unimodal ASR and multimodal LLM-based speech recognition systems using both spontaneous and non-spontaneous speech conversation drawn from various open African accented English speech datasets. Our empirical analysis reveals systematic variation: open-source ASR models excels in spontaneous speech contexts but degrades on noisy, non-native dialogue; multimodal LLMs are more accent-robust yet struggle with domain-specific named entities; proprietary models deliver high accuracy on clean speech but vary significantly by country and domain. Models fine-tuned on African English achieve competitive accuracy with lower latency, a practical advantage for deployment, hallucinations still remain a big problem for most SOTA models. By releasing this comprehensive benchmark, we empower practitioners and researchers to select voice technologies suited to African use-cases, fostering inclusive voice applications for underserved communities.

TL;DR: 提出了一种熵引导的训练框架来解决推理模型压缩中的熵冲突问题，将推理长度压缩到原始的20%同时保持或提升准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型的思维链输出过长导致计算成本高和部署困难，现有压缩方法忽略了训练过程中的熵冲突现象

Method: 采用熵引导的训练框架，在熵下降时鼓励简洁的思维步骤，在熵上升时在紧凑推理模式下增强探索以提升鲁棒性

Result: 在六个数学基准测试上，方法将推理长度压缩到原始的20%，同时保持甚至超过基线准确率

Conclusion: 熵引导训练框架能有效解决推理压缩中的熵冲突问题，实现高效且鲁棒的推理压缩

Abstract: Large reasoning models have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks, yet the excessive length of their chain-of-thought outputs remains a major practical bottleneck due to high computation cost and poor deployability. Existing compression methods have achieved partial success but overlook a crucial phenomenon in the training process -- the entropy conflict. During compression training, entropy decreases, leading to shorter reasoning but limited exploration, while accuracy-oriented objectives increase entropy, lengthening reasoning chains. This can cause the model to get stuck in a local dilemma. Our analysis further reveals the origin of the entropy conflict: many high-entropy tokens are logical connectors that receive larger gradients and are encouraged under the performance objective, while the compression objective simultaneously penalizes these potentially redundant connectors. This opposing pressure creates a direct source of entropy conflict. To address these issues, we adopt an entropy-guided training framework. As entropy descends, the model is guided toward efficient reasoning by encouraging concise thought steps; as entropy rises, exploration is reinforced under the compact reasoning mode to improve robustness. Experiments on six mathematical benchmarks show that our method compresses reasoning length to 20% of the original while maintaining or even surpassing baseline accuracy. Code and models will be released publicly.

TL;DR: 通过预测概率分布来增强LLM置信度估计的深度推理，该方法在不同模型和任务中均表现出优势，即使经过强化学习后仍保持有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解模型响应的可靠性在应用中至关重要。虽然已有研究关注通过链式思维推理生成可解释的置信度估计，但推理策略如何影响置信度估计仍需深入探索。

Method: 提出预测概率分布的方法，要求LLM考虑答案空间中的所有候选答案而非单一猜测，并仔细分配置信度分数以满足分布要求，从而鼓励深度推理。

Result: 该方法在不同模型和各种任务中均显示出优势，无论答案空间是否已知。即使经过强化学习后，其优势仍然保持，且推理模式与人类期望一致。

Conclusion: 预测概率分布是增强LLM置信度估计深度推理的有效方法，具有广泛适用性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Knowing the reliability of a model's response is essential in application. With the strong generation capabilities of LLMs, research has focused on generating verbalized confidence. This is further enhanced by combining chain-of-thought reasoning, which provides logical and transparent estimation. However, how reasoning strategies affect the estimated confidence is still under-explored. In this work, we demonstrate that predicting a verbalized probability distribution can effectively encourage in-depth reasoning for confidence estimation. Intuitively, it requires an LLM to consider all candidates within the answer space instead of basing on a single guess, and to carefully assign confidence scores to meet the requirements of a distribution. This method shows an advantage across different models and various tasks, regardless of whether the answer space is known. Its advantage is maintained even after reinforcement learning, and further analysis shows its reasoning patterns are aligned with human expectations.

Motivation: 现有阿拉伯语评估基准主要关注知识性任务，缺乏对基础语言结构理解的直接评估，需要专门工具来衡量大语言模型的真实语言掌握程度而非表面模式识别。

Method: 构建包含语法、形态学、拼写、阅读理解和句法5个类别的150道专家设计多选题，对35个阿拉伯语和双语大语言模型进行全面评估。

Result: 当前模型在表面水平表现出色，但在深层语法和句法推理方面存在困难，许多模型通过记忆或模式识别而非真实理解来获得高分。

Conclusion: AraLingBench揭示了知识性基准高分与真实语言掌握之间的差距，为开发阿拉伯语大语言模型提供了诊断框架，评估代码已在GitHub公开。

Abstract: We present AraLingBench: a fully human annotated benchmark for evaluating the Arabic linguistic competence of large language models (LLMs). The benchmark spans five core categories: grammar, morphology, spelling, reading comprehension, and syntax, through 150 expert-designed multiple choice questions that directly assess structural language understanding. Evaluating 35 Arabic and bilingual LLMs reveals that current models demonstrate strong surface level proficiency but struggle with deeper grammatical and syntactic reasoning. AraLingBench highlights a persistent gap between high scores on knowledge-based benchmarks and true linguistic mastery, showing that many models succeed through memorization or pattern recognition rather than authentic comprehension. By isolating and measuring fundamental linguistic skills, AraLingBench provides a diagnostic framework for developing Arabic LLMs. The full evaluation code is publicly available on GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLMs遵循用户指令的能力，但忽视了指令包含冲突约束的常见场景，LLMs在此类条件下的行为尚未充分探索。

Method: 引入ConInstruct基准数据集，专门评估LLMs检测和解决用户指令中冲突的能力，分析其冲突检测性能和解决行为。

Result: 专有LLMs冲突检测能力强，开源模型中仅DeepSeek-R1表现类似；DeepSeek-R1和Claude-4.5-Sonnet平均F1分数最高（91.5%和87.3%）；LLMs很少明确通知用户冲突或请求澄清。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在冲突指令处理上存在关键缺陷，很少主动通知用户冲突，这是设计指令遵循型LLMs时需要改进的重要方向。

Abstract: Instruction-following is a critical capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). While existing works primarily focus on assessing how well LLMs adhere to user instructions, they often overlook scenarios where instructions contain conflicting constraints-a common occurrence in complex prompts. The behavior of LLMs under such conditions remains under-explored. To bridge this gap, we introduce ConInstruct, a benchmark specifically designed to assess LLMs' ability to detect and resolve conflicts within user instructions. Using this dataset, we evaluate LLMs' conflict detection performance and analyze their conflict resolution behavior. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1) Most proprietary LLMs exhibit strong conflict detection capabilities, whereas among open-source models, only DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates similarly strong performance. DeepSeek-R1 and Claude-4.5-Sonnet achieve the highest average F1-scores at 91.5% and 87.3%, respectively, ranking first and second overall. (2) Despite their strong conflict detection abilities, LLMs rarely explicitly notify users about the conflicts or request clarification when faced with conflicting constraints. These results underscore a critical shortcoming in current LLMs and highlight an important area for future improvement when designing instruction-following LLMs.

Conclusion: 通过统一自然语言和分子结构表示的方法，成功解决了LLMs在化学领域的应用瓶颈，提升了模型在化学任务上的表现。

Abstract: The application of large language models (LLMs) to chemistry is frequently hampered by a "tokenization bottleneck", where tokenizers tuned on general-domain text tend to fragment chemical representations such as SMILES into semantically uninformative sub-tokens. This paper introduces a principled methodology to resolve this bottleneck by unifying the representation of natural language and molecular structures within a single model. Our approach involves targeted vocabulary extension-augmenting a pretrained LLM's vocabulary with chemically salient tokens, followed by continued pretraining on chemistry-domain text to integrate this new knowledge. We provide an empirical demonstration of the effectiveness of this strategy, showing that our methodology leads to superior performance on a range of downstream chemical tasks.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to performance saturation on many established benchmarks, questioning their ability to distinguish frontier models. Concurrently, existing high-difficulty benchmarks often suffer from narrow disciplinary focus, oversimplified answer formats, and vulnerability to data contamination, creating a fidelity gap with real-world scientific inquiry. To address these challenges, we introduce ATLAS (AGI-Oriented Testbed for Logical Application in Science), a large-scale, high-difficulty, and cross-disciplinary evaluation suite composed of approximately 800 original problems. Developed by domain experts (PhD-level and above), ATLAS spans seven core scientific fields: mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, computer science, earth science, and materials science. Its key features include: (1) High Originality and Contamination Resistance, with all questions newly created or substantially adapted to prevent test data leakage; (2) Cross-Disciplinary Focus, designed to assess models' ability to integrate knowledge and reason across scientific domains; (3) High-Fidelity Answers, prioritizing complex, open-ended answers involving multi-step reasoning and LaTeX-formatted expressions over simple multiple-choice questions; and (4) Rigorous Quality Control, employing a multi-stage process of expert peer review and adversarial testing to ensure question difficulty, scientific value, and correctness. We also propose a robust evaluation paradigm using a panel of LLM judges for automated, nuanced assessment of complex answers. Preliminary results on leading models demonstrate ATLAS's effectiveness in differentiating their advanced scientific reasoning capabilities. We plan to develop ATLAS into a long-term, open, community-driven platform to provide a reliable "ruler" for progress toward Artificial General Intelligence.

Conclusion: 缓解全标签偏差对于提升基于LLM方法的性能和鲁棒性至关重要，特别是在类标签自然包含多标记的真实世界应用中

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are powerful zero- and few-shot learners. However, when predicting over a set of candidate options, LLMs suffer from label biases, and existing calibration methods overlook biases arising from multi-token class labels. We tackle an issue we call label length bias, where labels of different lengths are treated inconsistently, even after standard length normalization. To mitigate it, we propose normalized contextual calibration (NCC), an effective method that normalizes and calibrates predictions at the full-label level. NCC achieves statistically significant improvements over prior approaches across multiple datasets and models, with gains of up to 10% F1. Moreover, NCC extends bias mitigation to broader tasks such as multiple-choice question answering. Our analysis shows that, when combined with in-context learning, NCC is less sensitive to few-shot example selection, requires fewer examples for competitive performance, and produces more reliable confidence estimates. These findings highlight the importance of mitigating full-label biases to improve the performance and robustness of LLM-based methods, particularly in real-world applications where class labels naturally consist of multiple tokens.

Conclusion: TSSF框架能同时缓解越狱和微调攻击，为教育LLM提供有效的安全防护，在保持实用性的同时增强安全性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into educational applications. However, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak and fine-tuning attacks, which can compromise safety alignment and lead to harmful outputs. Existing studies mainly focus on general safety evaluations, with limited attention to the unique safety requirements of educational scenarios. To address this gap, we construct EduHarm, a benchmark containing safe-unsafe instruction pairs across five representative educational scenarios, enabling systematic safety evaluation of educational LLMs. Furthermore, we propose a three-stage shield framework (TSSF) for educational LLMs that simultaneously mitigates both jailbreak and fine-tuning attacks. First, safety-aware attention realignment redirects attention toward critical unsafe tokens, thereby restoring the harmfulness feature that discriminates between unsafe and safe inputs. Second, layer-wise safety judgment identifies harmfulness features by aggregating safety cues across multiple layers to detect unsafe instructions. Finally, defense-driven dual routing separates safe and unsafe queries, ensuring normal processing for benign inputs and guarded responses for harmful ones. Extensive experiments across eight jailbreak attack strategies demonstrate that TSSF effectively strengthens safety while preventing over-refusal of benign queries. Evaluations on three fine-tuning attack datasets further show that it consistently achieves robust defense against harmful queries while maintaining preserving utility gains from benign fine-tuning.

Abstract: Recent advances in medical large language models (LLMs), multimodal models, and agents demand evaluation frameworks that reflect real clinical workflows and safety constraints. We present MedBench v4, a nationwide, cloud-based benchmarking infrastructure comprising over 700,000 expert-curated tasks spanning 24 primary and 91 secondary specialties, with dedicated tracks for LLMs, multimodal models, and agents. Items undergo multi-stage refinement and multi-round review by clinicians from more than 500 institutions, and open-ended responses are scored by an LLM-as-a-judge calibrated to human ratings. We evaluate 15 frontier models. Base LLMs reach a mean overall score of 54.1/100 (best: Claude Sonnet 4.5, 62.5/100), but safety and ethics remain low (18.4/100). Multimodal models perform worse overall (mean 47.5/100; best: GPT-5, 54.9/100), with solid perception yet weaker cross-modal reasoning. Agents built on the same backbones substantially improve end-to-end performance (mean 79.8/100), with Claude Sonnet 4.5-based agents achieving up to 85.3/100 overall and 88.9/100 on safety tasks. MedBench v4 thus reveals persisting gaps in multimodal reasoning and safety for base models, while showing that governance-aware agentic orchestration can markedly enhance benchmarked clinical readiness without sacrificing capability. By aligning tasks with Chinese clinical guidelines and regulatory priorities, the platform offers a practical reference for hospitals, developers, and policymakers auditing medical AI.

The system integrates three components: (i) a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) assistant for personalized, knowledge-grounded dialogue; (ii) a synthetic client-therapist dialogue generator conditioned on client profiles to facilitate research on therapeutic language and data augmentation; and (iii) a Well-being AI crew, implemented with CrewAI, that produces weekly self-care plans and guided meditation audio. The system is designed as a reflective space for emotional processing rather than a substitute for professional therapy. It illustrates how conversational assistants can lower barriers to support, complement existing care, and broaden access to mental health resources. To address the shortage of confidential therapeutic data, we introduce synthetic client-therapist dialogue generation conditioned on client profiles. Finally, the planner demonstrates an innovative agentic workflow for dynamically adaptive, personalized self-care, bridging the limitations of static well-being tools. We describe the architecture, demonstrate its functionalities, and report evaluation of the RAG assistant in curated well-being scenarios using both automatic LLM-based judgments and a human-user study. This work highlights opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration between NLP researchers and mental health professionals to advance responsible innovation in human-AI interaction for well-being.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being explored for building Agents capable of active environmental interaction (e.g., via tool use) to solve complex problems. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is considered a key technology with significant potential for training such Agents; however, the effective application of RL to LLM Agents is still in its nascent stages and faces considerable challenges. Currently, this emerging field lacks in-depth exploration into RL approaches specifically tailored for the LLM Agent context, alongside a scarcity of flexible and easily extensible training frameworks designed for this purpose. To help advance this area, this paper first revisits and clarifies Reinforcement Learning methodologies for LLM Agents by systematically extending the Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework to comprehensively define the key components of an LLM Agent. Secondly, we introduce Agent-R1, a modular, flexible, and user-friendly training framework for RL-based LLM Agents, designed for straightforward adaptation across diverse task scenarios and interactive environments. We conducted experiments on Multihop QA benchmark tasks, providing initial validation for the effectiveness of our proposed methods and framework.

Abstract: With Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) becoming more and more prominent in generative AI solutions, there is an emerging need for systematically evaluating their effectiveness. We introduce the LiveRAG benchmark, a publicly available dataset of 895 synthetic questions and answers designed to support systematic evaluation of RAG-based Q&A systems. This synthetic benchmark is derived from the one used during the SIGIR'2025 LiveRAG Challenge, where competitors were evaluated under strict time constraints. It is augmented with information that was not made available to competitors during the Challenge, such as the ground-truth answers, together with their associated supporting claims which were used for evaluating competitors' answers. In addition, each question is associated with estimated difficulty and discriminability scores, derived from applying an Item Response Theory model to competitors' responses. Our analysis highlights the benchmark's questions diversity, the wide range of their difficulty levels, and their usefulness in differentiating between system capabilities. The LiveRAG benchmark will hopefully help the community advance RAG research, conduct systematic evaluation, and develop more robust Q&A systems.

Method: 探索了将同一源文档的两组主张对齐的方法，通过计算对齐分数来衡量相似性，研究识别最佳对齐和评估方法的技术。

Result: 在捷克和斯洛伐克新闻评论数据集上的实验表明，当前评估方法在文档级主张提取中存在局限性，需要更先进的方法来捕捉语义相似性和评估关键主张属性。

Conclusion: 需要开发能够正确捕捉语义相似性并评估原子性、可核查性和去语境化等关键主张属性的更先进评估方法。

Abstract: Document-level claim extraction remains an open challenge in the field of fact-checking, and subsequently, methods for evaluating extracted claims have received limited attention. In this work, we explore approaches to aligning two sets of claims pertaining to the same source document and computing their similarity through an alignment score. We investigate techniques to identify the best possible alignment and evaluation method between claim sets, with the aim of providing a reliable evaluation framework. Our approach enables comparison between model-extracted and human-annotated claim sets, serving as a metric for assessing the extraction performance of models and also as a possible measure of inter-annotator agreement. We conduct experiments on newly collected dataset-claims extracted from comments under Czech and Slovak news articles-domains that pose additional challenges due to the informal language, strong local context, and subtleties of these closely related languages. The results draw attention to the limitations of current evaluation approaches when applied to document-level claim extraction and highlight the need for more advanced methods-ones able to correctly capture semantic similarity and evaluate essential claim properties such as atomicity, checkworthiness, and decontextualization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 急性肾损伤患者有发展为慢性肾病的高风险，但识别最高风险患者仍然具有挑战性，需要开发数据驱动的方法来早期识别高危人群。

Method: 使用电子健康记录数据，通过纵向医疗编码和肌酐测量值聚类识别AKI后临床状态，采用多状态模型估计状态间转移概率和CKD进展风险，通过生存分析识别不同亚群的CKD风险因素。

Result: 在20,699名AKI患者中，3,491名（17%）发展为CKD；识别出15种不同的AKI后临床状态，每种状态具有不同的CKD发展概率；75%患者在研究期间保持在单一状态或仅进行一次转移；发现了已知和新的CKD风险因素，其影响在不同临床状态间存在差异。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了一种数据驱动的方法来识别高危AKI患者，为开发早期CKD检测和干预的决策支持工具提供了支持。

Abstract: Patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) are at high risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD), but identifying those at greatest risk remains challenging. We used electronic health record (EHR) data to dynamically track AKI patients' clinical evolution and characterize AKI-to-CKD progression. Post-AKI clinical states were identified by clustering patient vectors derived from longitudinal medical codes and creatinine measurements. Transition probabilities between states and progression to CKD were estimated using multi-state modeling. After identifying common post-AKI trajectories, CKD risk factors in AKI subpopulations were identified through survival analysis. Of 20,699 patients with AKI at admission, 3,491 (17%) developed CKD. We identified fifteen distinct post-AKI states, each with different probabilities of CKD development. Most patients (75%, n=15,607) remained in a single state or made only one transition during the study period. Both established (e.g., AKI severity, diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, liver disease) and novel CKD risk factors, with their impact varying across these clinical states. This study demonstrates a data-driven approach for identifying high-risk AKI patients, supporting the development of decision-support tools for early CKD detection and intervention.

Motivation: 尽管NLP技术已能自动分类政治偏见，但大语言模型与人类判断的一致性程度仍未被充分探索和理解。

Method: 构建手动标注的新闻文章数据集，评估标注一致性、偏见极性和模型间一致性，量化人类与模型在偏见感知上的差异。

Result: 传统transformer模型中RoBERTa与人类标签最一致，生成模型如GPT在零样本设置下与人类标注整体一致性最强。微调的RoBERTa模型在所有基线中获得最高准确率和最强的人类标注对齐度。

Conclusion: 人类与LLMs在政治偏见感知上存在系统性差异，需要结合人类可解释性和模型可扩展性的混合评估框架来进行自动媒体偏见检测。

Abstract: Detecting political bias in news media is a complex task that requires interpreting subtle linguistic and contextual cues. Although recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have enabled automatic bias classification, the extent to which large language models (LLMs) align with human judgment still remains relatively underexplored and not yet well understood. This study aims to present a comparative framework for evaluating the detection of political bias across human annotations and multiple LLMs, including GPT, BERT, RoBERTa, and FLAN. We construct a manually annotated dataset of news articles and assess annotation consistency, bias polarity, and inter-model agreement to quantify divergence between human and model perceptions of bias. Experimental results show that among traditional transformer-based models, RoBERTa achieves the highest alignment with human labels, whereas generative models such as GPT demonstrate the strongest overall agreement with human annotations in a zero-shot setting. Among all transformer-based baselines, our fine-tuned RoBERTa model acquired the highest accuracy and the strongest alignment with human-annotated labels. Our findings highlight systematic differences in how humans and LLMs perceive political slant, underscoring the need for hybrid evaluation frameworks that combine human interpretability with model scalability in automated media bias detection.

Abstract: We show that multi-agent systems guided by vision-language models (VLMs) improve end-to-end autonomous scientific discovery. By treating plots as verifiable checkpoints, a VLM-as-a-judge evaluates figures against dynamically generated domain-specific rubrics, enabling agents to correct their own errors and steer exploratory data analysis in real-time. Case studies in cosmology and astrochemistry demonstrate recovery from faulty reasoning paths and adaptation to new datasets without human intervention. On a 10-task benchmark for data-driven discovery, VLM-augmented systems achieve pass at 1 scores of 0.7-0.8, compared to 0.2-0.3 for code-only and 0.4-0.5 for code-and-text baselines, while also providing auditable reasoning traces that improve interpretability.

Motivation: 罕见病影响全球数亿人，但诊断往往需要多年时间。传统方法将证据提取与诊断推理分离，而通用/医学大语言模型面临真实世界电子健康记录稀缺、领域知识陈旧和幻觉问题。

Method: 构建大型领域专业临床语料库和临床医生验证的推理集，通过分阶段指令调优、思维链学习和图基础检索开发RareSeek R1。

Conclusion: 这项工作推进了以叙述为先、知识整合的推理范式，缩短诊断历程，并提供可审计、临床可转化的决策支持。

Abstract: Rare diseases affect hundreds of millions worldwide, yet diagnosis often spans years. Convectional pipelines decouple noisy evidence extraction from downstream inferential diagnosis, and general/medical large language models (LLMs) face scarce real world electronic health records (EHRs), stale domain knowledge, and hallucinations. We assemble a large, domain specialized clinical corpus and a clinician validated reasoning set, and develop RareSeek R1 via staged instruction tuning, chain of thought learning, and graph grounded retrieval. Across multicenter EHR narratives and public benchmarks, RareSeek R1 attains state of the art accuracy, robust generalization, and stability under noisy or overlapping phenotypes. Augmented retrieval yields the largest gains when narratives pair with prioritized variants by resolving ambiguity and aligning candidates to mechanisms. Human studies show performance on par with experienced physicians and consistent gains in assistive use. Notably, transparent reasoning highlights decisive non phenotypic evidence (median 23.1%, such as imaging, interventions, functional tests) underpinning many correct diagnoses. This work advances a narrative first, knowledge integrated reasoning paradigm that shortens the diagnostic odyssey and enables auditable, clinically translatable decision support.

Motivation: 比较幻觉现象表明人们在语言理解中会系统性地误解刺激，本研究旨在通过噪声通道理论解释这种现象的强度差异。

Result: 模型不仅解释了比较幻觉效应的精细梯度，还解释了代词与完整名词短语在than从句中引起的先前未解释的效应。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持噪声通道推断作为语言处理现象的统一计算层面理论。

Abstract: Like visual processing, language processing is susceptible to illusions in which people systematically misperceive stimuli. In one such case--the comparative illusion (CI), e.g., More students have been to Russia than I have--comprehenders tend to judge the sentence as acceptable despite its underlying nonsensical comparison. Prior research has argued that this phenomenon can be explained as Bayesian inference over a noisy channel: the posterior probability of an interpretation of a sentence is proportional to both the prior probability of that interpretation and the likelihood of corruption into the observed (CI) sentence. Initial behavioral work has supported this claim by evaluating a narrow set of alternative interpretations of CI sentences and showing that comprehenders favor interpretations that are more likely to have been corrupted into the illusory sentence. In this study, we replicate and go substantially beyond this earlier work by directly predicting the strength of illusion with a quantitative model of the posterior probability of plausible interpretations, which we derive through a novel synthesis of statistical language models with human behavioral data. Our model explains not only the fine gradations in the strength of CI effects, but also a previously unexplained effect caused by pronominal vs. full noun phrase than-clause subjects. These findings support a noisy-channel theory of sentence comprehension by demonstrating that the theory makes novel predictions about the comparative illusion that bear out empirically. This outcome joins related evidence of noisy channel processing in both illusory and non-illusory contexts to support noisy channel inference as a unified computational-level theory of diverse language processing phenomena.

Method: 提出标注偏见分类法，包括指令偏见、标注者偏见和情境文化偏见；使用标注者间一致性、模型分歧和元数据分析等检测方法；采用多样化标注者招募、迭代指南优化和事后模型调整等缓解策略。

Conclusion: 这些见解旨在为LLMs构建更公平和基于文化的标注流程提供指导，促进多语言模型在文化多样性环境中的公平发展。

Abstract: Annotation bias in NLP datasets remains a major challenge for developing multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in culturally diverse settings. Bias from task framing, annotator subjectivity, and cultural mismatches can distort model outputs and exacerbate social harms. We propose a comprehensive framework for understanding annotation bias, distinguishing among instruction bias, annotator bias, and contextual and cultural bias. We review detection methods (including inter-annotator agreement, model disagreement, and metadata analysis) and highlight emerging techniques such as multilingual model divergence and cultural inference. We further outline proactive and reactive mitigation strategies, including diverse annotator recruitment, iterative guideline refinement, and post-hoc model adjustments. Our contributions include: (1) a typology of annotation bias; (2) a synthesis of detection metrics; (3) an ensemble-based bias mitigation approach adapted for multilingual settings, and (4) an ethical analysis of annotation processes. Together, these insights aim to inform more equitable and culturally grounded annotation pipelines for LLMs.

Abstract: Contract management involves reviewing and negotiating provisions, individual clauses that define rights, obligations, and terms of agreement. During this process, revisions to provisions are proposed and iteratively refined, some of which may be problematic or unacceptable. Automating this workflow is challenging due to the scarcity of labeled data and the abundance of unstructured legacy contracts. In this paper, we present a modular framework designed to streamline contract management through a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline. Our system integrates synthetic data generation, semantic clause retrieval, acceptability classification, and reward-based alignment to flag problematic revisions and generate improved alternatives. Developed and evaluated in collaboration with an industry partner, our system achieves over 80% accuracy in both identifying and optimizing problematic revisions, demonstrating strong performance under real-world, low-resource conditions and offering a practical means of accelerating contract revision workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Herdan定律假设类型-标记关系符合幂律，在log-log尺度下应为直线，但实际观测显示仍存在轻微凹形，需要更精确的数学模型来描述这一现象。

Method: 使用20部英文小说或翻译作品的数据，在log-log尺度下进行回归分析，包含线性和二次项；并采用"从袋中随机抽取彩色球并放回"的模型进行理论推导。

Result: 回归分析显示线性系数略大于1，二次系数约为-0.02；通过随机抽球模型证明log-log尺度的曲率等同于负的伪方差。

Conclusion: 二次函数比幂律函数能更好地描述类型-标记关系，伪方差形式化为理解曲率提供了理论框架，但在大标记数时存在数值不稳定性问题。

Abstract: Heaps' or Herdan's law characterizes the word-type vs. word-token relation by a power-law function, which is concave in linear-linear scale but a straight line in log-log scale. However, it has been observed that even in log-log scale, the type-token curve is still slightly concave, invalidating the power-law relation. At the next-order approximation, we have shown, by twenty English novels or writings (some are translated from another language to English), that quadratic functions in log-log scale fit the type-token data perfectly. Regression analyses of log(type)-log(token) data with both a linear and quadratic term consistently lead to a linear coefficient of slightly larger than 1, and a quadratic coefficient around -0.02. Using the ``random drawing colored ball from the bag with replacement" model, we have shown that the curvature of the log-log scale is identical to a ``pseudo-variance" which is negative. Although a pseudo-variance calculation may encounter numeric instability when the number of tokens is large, due to the large values of pseudo-weights, this formalism provides a rough estimation of the curvature when the number of tokens is small.

Conclusion: SMRC方法能有效对齐大语言模型与学生推理过程，为教育场景下的数学推理错误校正提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often make reasoning errors when solving mathematical problems, and how to automatically detect and correct these errors has become an important research direction. However, existing approaches \textit{mainly focus on self-correction within the model}, which falls short of the ``teacher-style`` correction required in educational settings, \textit{i.e.}, systematically guiding and revising a student's problem-solving process. To address this gap, we propose \texttt{SMRC} (\textit{\underline{S}tudent \underline{M}athematical \underline{R}easoning \underline{C}orrection}), a novel method that aligns LLMs with student reasoning. Specifically, \texttt{SMRC} formulates student reasoning as a multi-step sequential decision problem and introduces Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to explore optimal correction paths. To reduce the cost of the annotating process-level rewards, we leverage breadth-first search (BFS) guided by LLMs and final-answer evaluation to generate reward signals, which are then distributed across intermediate reasoning steps via a back-propagation mechanism, enabling fine-grained process supervision. Additionally, we construct a benchmark for high school mathematics, MSEB (Multi-Solution Error Benchmark), consisting of 158 instances that include problem statements, student solutions, and correct reasoning steps. We further propose a dual evaluation protocol centered on \textbf{solution accuracy} and \textbf{correct-step retention}, offering a comprehensive measure of educational applicability. Experiments demonstrate that \texttt{SMRC} significantly outperforms existing methods on two public datasets (ProcessBench and MR-GSM8K) and our MSEB in terms of effectiveness and overall performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated the ability to generalize well at many levels across domains, modalities, and even shown in-context learning capabilities. This enables research questions regarding how they can be used to encode physical information that is usually only available from scientific measurements, and loosely encoded in textual descriptions. Using astrophysics as a test bed, we investigate if LLM embeddings can codify physical summary statistics that are obtained from scientific measurements through two main questions: 1) Does prompting play a role on how those quantities are codified by the LLM? and 2) What aspects of language are most important in encoding the physics represented by the measurement? We investigate this using sparse autoencoders that extract interpretable features from the text.

Result: 在特定历史时期测试集上，词性标注、词形还原和命名实体识别任务取得了显著提升，证明了领域特定模型的重要性。

Conclusion: 即使相对有限的合成数据也能改善低资源语料的NLP工具，为计算人文学研究提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Historical and low-resource NLP remains challenging due to limited annotated data and domain mismatches with modern, web-sourced corpora. This paper outlines our work in using large language models (LLMs) to create ground-truth annotations for historical French (16th-20th centuries) and Chinese (1900-1950) texts. By leveraging LLM-generated ground truth on a subset of our corpus, we were able to fine-tune spaCy to achieve significant gains on period-specific tests for part-of-speech (POS) annotations, lemmatization, and named entity recognition (NER). Our results underscore the importance of domain-specific models and demonstrate that even relatively limited amounts of synthetic data can improve NLP tools for under-resourced corpora in computational humanities research.

TL;DR: VALOR是一个用于多模态客户支持对话的投诉分析框架，结合文本投诉和视觉证据进行细粒度分类，通过专家路由和语义对齐提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有投诉分析方法主要依赖单模态短文本，该工作旨在利用多模态、多轮客户支持对话，结合文本和视觉证据进行更精细的投诉分析。

Method: 提出VALOR框架，采用多专家推理设置，使用大规模生成模型和思维链提示进行决策，通过语义对齐分数和元融合策略确保模态间一致性。

Result: 在标注了细粒度方面和严重性标签的多模态投诉数据集上评估，VALOR始终优于基线模型，特别是在信息分布在文本和图像中的复杂投诉场景中。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了多模态交互和专家验证在实际投诉理解系统中的价值，支持联合国可持续发展目标9和12。

Abstract: Existing approaches to complaint analysis largely rely on unimodal, short-form content such as tweets or product reviews. This work advances the field by leveraging multimodal, multi-turn customer support dialogues, where users often share both textual complaints and visual evidence (e.g., screenshots, product photos) to enable fine-grained classification of complaint aspects and severity. We introduce VALOR, a Validation-Aware Learner with Expert Routing, tailored for this multimodal setting. It employs a multi-expert reasoning setup using large-scale generative models with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting for nuanced decision-making. To ensure coherence between modalities, a semantic alignment score is computed and integrated into the final classification through a meta-fusion strategy. In alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), the proposed framework supports SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) by advancing AI-driven tools for robust, scalable, and context-aware service infrastructure. Further, by enabling structured analysis of complaint narratives and visual context, it contributes to SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) by promoting more responsive product design and improved accountability in consumer services. We evaluate VALOR on a curated multimodal complaint dataset annotated with fine-grained aspect and severity labels, showing that it consistently outperforms baseline models, especially in complex complaint scenarios where information is distributed across text and images. This study underscores the value of multimodal interaction and expert validation in practical complaint understanding systems.

*Ali Salehi,Cassandra L. Jacobs*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 比较库尔德语词嵌入的三种分词策略：词级、基于语素和BPE方法，发现BPE在形态相似性评估中存在覆盖偏差，而基于语素的分词在综合评估中表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究库尔德语这种低资源语言的分词策略对词嵌入质量的影响，特别关注不同分词方法在形态相似性保持方面的表现差异。

Method: 开发基于BiLSTM-CRF的形态分割器，使用最小人工标注进行引导训练，在Word2Vec嵌入上比较三种分词策略，采用包括相似性保持、聚类质量和语义组织在内的综合评估指标。

Result: BPE方法在形态相似性评估中看似更优，但仅覆盖28.6%的测试用例，而语素模型覆盖68.7%。综合评估显示基于语素的分词在嵌入空间组织、语义邻域结构和跨形态复杂度覆盖方面表现更好。

Conclusion: 在低资源语言处理中，覆盖感知的评估至关重要，基于语素的分词方法为低资源语言处理提供了更好的分词选择。

Abstract: We investigate tokenization strategies for Kurdish word embeddings by comparing word-level, morpheme-based, and BPE approaches on morphological similarity preservation tasks. We develop a BiLSTM-CRF morphological segmenter using bootstrapped training from minimal manual annotation and evaluate Word2Vec embeddings across comprehensive metrics including similarity preservation, clustering quality, and semantic organization. Our analysis reveals critical evaluation biases in tokenization comparison. While BPE initially appears superior in morphological similarity, it evaluates only 28.6\% of test cases compared to 68.7\% for morpheme model, creating artificial performance inflation. When assessed comprehensively, morpheme-based tokenization demonstrates superior embedding space organization, better semantic neighborhood structure, and more balanced coverage across morphological complexity levels. These findings highlight the importance of coverage-aware evaluation in low-resource language processing and offers different tokenization methods for low-resourced language processing.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文介绍了SpatiaLite基准测试，发现先进视觉语言模型在空间推理方面主要依赖语言表征，存在效率低下问题，并提出了图像驱动框架来改进空间推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前先进的视觉语言模型在逻辑推理、问题解决等方面表现出色，但在空间推理（如心理旋转、导航等人类认知基础能力）方面仍存在显著挑战。研究假设想象力是空间世界模型中的主导推理机制。

Method: 引入SpatiaLite合成基准测试，联合测量空间推理准确性和效率；提出图像驱动框架（IDF）进行数据合成和训练，隐式构建内部世界模型。

Result: 发现三个关键结果：1）先进VLMs主要依赖语言表征，在视觉中心任务上表现不足；2）空间推理机制效率严重低下，token使用随复杂度快速增长；3）IDF框架能有效构建内部世界模型。

Conclusion: 本研究界定了先进VLMs的空间推理局限和模式，识别了关键缺陷，为未来改进提供了方向，特别是通过构建内部世界模型来增强空间推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs), such as DeepSeek R1,OpenAI o3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities across logical inference, problem solving, and decision making. However, spatial reasoning:a fundamental component of human cognition that includes mental rotation, navigation, and spatial relationship comprehension remains a significant challenge for current advanced VLMs. We hypothesize that imagination, the internal simulation of spatial states, is the dominant reasoning mechanism within a spatial world model. To test this hypothesis and systematically probe current VLM spatial reasoning mechanisms, we introduce SpatiaLite, a fully synthetic benchmark that jointly measures spatial reasoning accuracy and reasoning efficiency. Comprehensive experiments reveal three key findings. First, advanced VLMs predominantly rely on linguistic representations for reasoning and imagination, resulting in significant deficiencies on visual centric tasks that demand perceptual spatial relations and 3D geometry transformations such as mental rotation or projection prediction. Second, advanced VLMs exhibit severe inefficiency in their current spatial reasoning mechanisms, with token usage growing rapidly as transformation complexity increases. Third, we propose an Imagery Driven Framework (IDF) for data synthesis and training, which can implicitly construct an internal world model that is critical for spatial reasoning in VLMs. Building on SpatiaLite, this work delineates the spatial reasoning limits and patterns of advanced VLMs, identifies key shortcomings, and informs future advances

Motivation: 现有预测模型难以捕捉微生物燃料电池阳极结构的复杂几何依赖性，限制了性能优化。

Method: 使用KAN网络进行函数分解，通过几何解耦表示学习分离结构变化，结合统一注意力机制增强关键几何区域。

Result: 在ModelNet40基准数据集上超越15个SOTA模型，达到92.7%准确率；在真实MFC阳极结构问题上达到97%准确率。

Conclusion: KANGURA为3D几何建模提供了稳健框架，为先进制造和质量驱动工程应用中的复杂结构优化开辟了新可能。

Abstract: Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs) offer a promising pathway for sustainable energy generation by converting organic matter into electricity through microbial processes. A key factor influencing MFC performance is the anode structure, where design and material properties play a crucial role. Existing predictive models struggle to capture the complex geometric dependencies necessary to optimize these structures. To solve this problem, we propose KANGURA: Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-Based Geometry-Aware Learning with Unified Representation Attention. KANGURA introduces a new approach to three-dimensional (3D) machine learning modeling. It formulates prediction as a function decomposition problem, where Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN)- based representation learning reconstructs geometric relationships without a conventional multi- layer perceptron (MLP). To refine spatial understanding, geometry-disentangled representation learning separates structural variations into interpretable components, while unified attention mechanisms dynamically enhance critical geometric regions. Experimental results demonstrate that KANGURA outperforms over 15 state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on the ModelNet40 benchmark dataset, achieving 92.7% accuracy, and excels in a real-world MFC anode structure problem with 97% accuracy. This establishes KANGURA as a robust framework for 3D geometric modeling, unlocking new possibilities for optimizing complex structures in advanced manufacturing and quality-driven engineering applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估自主AI科学家KOSMOS在辐射生物学问题上的表现，验证其生成假设的能力和可靠性。

Method: 使用简单随机基因零基准测试评估KOSMOS在三个辐射生物学问题上的表现：DNA损伤反应与p53转录响应关系、OGT和CDO1基因表达与辐射响应模块关系、12基因特征预测前列腺癌放疗后生存。

Result: 假设1不支持（DDR评分与p53响应弱负相关，rho=-0.40,p=0.76）；OGT弱相关（r=0.23,p=0.34），CDO1明显异常（r=0.70,p=0.0039）；12基因特征一致性指数0.61（p=0.017）但效应大小不唯一。

Conclusion: AI科学家能生成有用想法，但需要针对适当零模型进行严格审计，以避免假阳性发现。

Abstract: Agentic AI "scientists" now use language models to search the literature, run analyses, and generate hypotheses. We evaluate KOSMOS, an autonomous AI scientist, on three problems in radiation biology using simple random-gene null benchmarks. Hypothesis 1: baseline DNA damage response (DDR) capacity across cell lines predicts the p53 transcriptional response after irradiation (GSE30240). Hypothesis 2: baseline expression of OGT and CDO1 predicts the strength of repressed and induced radiation-response modules in breast cancer cells (GSE59732). Hypothesis 3: a 12-gene expression signature predicts biochemical recurrence-free survival after prostate radiotherapy plus androgen deprivation therapy (GSE116918). The DDR-p53 hypothesis was not supported: DDR score and p53 response were weakly negatively correlated (Spearman rho = -0.40, p = 0.76), indistinguishable from random five-gene scores. OGT showed only a weak association (r = 0.23, p = 0.34), whereas CDO1 was a clear outlier (r = 0.70, empirical p = 0.0039). The 12-gene signature achieved a concordance index of 0.61 (p = 0.017) but a non-unique effect size. Overall, KOSMOS produced one well-supported discovery, one plausible but uncertain result, and one false hypothesis, illustrating that AI scientists can generate useful ideas but require rigorous auditing against appropriate null models.

Motivation: Bjøru等人的方法仅适用于马尔可夫模型，其中外生变量仅影响单个内生变量。但在实际应用中，半马尔可夫模型能表示更复杂的混淆关系，因此需要扩展该方法。

Conclusion: 成功将分治算法从马尔可夫模型扩展到半马尔可夫模型，为处理更复杂的因果推断问题提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Recently, Bjøru et al. proposed a novel divide-and-conquer algorithm for bounding counterfactual probabilities in structural causal models (SCMs). They assumed that the SCMs were learned from purely observational data, leading to an imprecise characterization of the marginal distributions of exogenous variables. Their method leveraged the canonical representation of structural equations to decompose a general SCM with high-cardinality exogenous variables into a set of sub-models with low-cardinality exogenous variables. These sub-models had precise marginals over the exogenous variables and therefore admitted efficient exact inference. The aggregated results were used to bound counterfactual probabilities in the original model. The approach was developed for Markovian models, where each exogenous variable affects only a single endogenous variable. In this paper, we investigate extending the methodology to \textit{semi-Markovian} SCMs, where exogenous variables may influence multiple endogenous variables. Such models are capable of representing confounding relationships that Markovian models cannot. We illustrate the challenges of this extension using a minimal example, which motivates a set of alternative solution strategies. These strategies are evaluated both theoretically and through a computational study.

Conclusion: LVLMs在智能交通系统中存在严重安全风险，图像排版操纵和多轮提示的越狱攻击威胁显著，需要加强安全防护措施。

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in multimodal reasoning and many real-world applications, such as visual question answering. However, LVLMs are highly vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks. This paper systematically analyzes the vulnerabilities of LVLMs integrated in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) under carefully crafted jailbreaking attacks. First, we carefully construct a dataset with harmful queries relevant to transportation, following OpenAI's prohibited categories to which the LVLMs should not respond. Second, we introduce a novel jailbreaking attack that exploits the vulnerabilities of LVLMs through image typography manipulation and multi-turn prompting. Third, we propose a multi-layered response filtering defense technique to prevent the model from generating inappropriate responses. We perform extensive experiments with the proposed attack and defense on the state-of-the-art LVLMs (both open-source and closed-source). To evaluate the attack method and defense technique, we use GPT-4's judgment to determine the toxicity score of the generated responses, as well as manual verification. Further, we compare our proposed jailbreaking method with existing jailbreaking techniques and highlight severe security risks involved with jailbreaking attacks with image typography manipulation and multi-turn prompting in the LVLMs integrated in ITS.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CORGI是一种新的模式匹配算法，为实时AI系统和数据库查询提供二次时间和空间保证，避免RETE算法在复杂匹配中的指数级开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时AI系统和关系数据库查询需要解决复杂匹配问题，但现有模式匹配系统在处理具有多个未约束变量的规则时可能产生指数级时间和空间需求，导致内存溢出和执行中断。

Method: CORGI采用两步法：正向构建/维护基础关系图，反向通过迭代器按需生成匹配，不使用传统的β-内存收集部分匹配。

Result: 性能评估显示，在简单组合匹配任务中，CORGI显著优于SOAR和OPS5的RETE实现。

Conclusion: CORGI通过消除填充完整冲突集导致的高延迟和内存溢出，使自动生成的规则在实际系统中可行。

Abstract: Rule-based systems must solve complex matching problems within tight time constraints to be effective in real-time applications, such as planning and reactive control for AI agents, as well as low-latency relational database querying. Pattern-matching systems can encounter issues where exponential time and space are required to find matches for rules with many underconstrained variables, or which produce combinatorial intermediate partial matches (but are otherwise well-constrained). When online AI systems automatically generate rules from example-driven induction or code synthesis, they can easily produce worst-case matching patterns that slow or halt program execution by exceeding available memory. In our own work with cognitive systems that learn from example, we've found that aggressive forms of anti-unification-based generalization can easily produce these circumstances. To make these systems practical without hand-engineering constraints or succumbing to unpredictable failure modes, we introduce a new matching algorithm called CORGI (Collection-Oriented Relational Graph Iteration). Unlike RETE-based approaches, CORGI offers quadratic time and space guarantees for finding single satisficing matches, and the ability to iteratively stream subsequent matches without committing entire conflict sets to memory. CORGI differs from RETE in that it does not have a traditional $β$-memory for collecting partial matches. Instead, CORGI takes a two-step approach: a graph of grounded relations is built/maintained in a forward pass, and an iterator generates matches as needed by working backward through the graph. This approach eliminates the high-latency delays and memory overflows that can result from populating full conflict sets. In a performance evaluation, we demonstrate that CORGI significantly outperforms RETE implementations from SOAR and OPS5 on a simple combinatorial matching task.

Method: 使用GPT-4o分析OSHA事故报告提取结构化危险推理，转换为对象级场景图，然后用文本到图像扩散模型生成危险场景图像，并通过VQA框架评估生成质量。

Result: 提出的VQA图分数在基于熵的验证中优于CLIP和BLIP指标，显示出更高的判别敏感性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效生成逼真的工作场所危险场景图像，为训练视觉模型检测安全隐患提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Training vision models to detect workplace hazards accurately requires realistic images of unsafe conditions that could lead to accidents. However, acquiring such datasets is difficult because capturing accident-triggering scenarios as they occur is nearly impossible. To overcome this limitation, this study presents a novel scene graph-guided generative AI framework that synthesizes photorealistic images of hazardous scenarios grounded in historical Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) accident reports. OSHA narratives are analyzed using GPT-4o to extract structured hazard reasoning, which is converted into object-level scene graphs capturing spatial and contextual relationships essential for understanding risk. These graphs guide a text-to-image diffusion model to generate compositionally accurate hazard scenes. To evaluate the realism and semantic fidelity of the generated data, a visual question answering (VQA) framework is introduced. Across four state-of-the-art generative models, the proposed VQA Graph Score outperforms CLIP and BLIP metrics based on entropy-based validation, confirming its higher discriminative sensitivity.

Abstract: This paper presents an integrative review and experimental validation of artificial intelligence (AI) agents applied to music analysis and education. We synthesize the historical evolution from rule-based models to contemporary approaches involving deep learning, multi-agent architectures, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks. The pedagogical implications are evaluated through a dual-case methodology: (1) the use of generative AI platforms in secondary education to foster analytical and creative skills; (2) the design of a multiagent system for symbolic music analysis, enabling modular, scalable, and explainable workflows.
  Experimental results demonstrate that AI agents effectively enhance musical pattern recognition, compositional parameterization, and educational feedback, outperforming traditional automated methods in terms of interpretability and adaptability. The findings highlight key challenges concerning transparency, cultural bias, and the definition of hybrid evaluation metrics, emphasizing the need for responsible deployment of AI in educational environments.
  This research contributes to a unified framework that bridges technical, pedagogical, and ethical considerations, offering evidence-based guidance for the design and application of intelligent agents in computational musicology and music education.

Motivation: 大型语言模型中的知识是静态的，难以适应不断变化的信息，现有方法在处理需要多步推理的复杂多跳问题时面临可扩展性和检索效率的挑战。

Method: ALEX采用分层内存架构组织知识更新，包含推理查询合成模块来弥合查询与事实之间的语义差距，以及动态证据裁决引擎执行高效的两阶段检索过程。

Result: 在MQUAKE基准测试中，ALEX显著提高了多跳答案的准确性和推理路径的可靠性，同时将所需搜索空间减少了80%以上。

Conclusion: ALEX为构建可扩展、高效和准确的知识编辑系统提供了一条有前景的路径。

Abstract: The static nature of knowledge within Large Language Models (LLMs) makes it difficult for them to adapt to evolving information, rendering knowledge editing a critical task. However, existing methods struggle with challenges of scalability and retrieval efficiency, particularly when handling complex, multi-hop questions that require multi-step reasoning. To address these challenges, this paper introduces ALEX (A Light Editing-knowledge Extractor), a lightweight knowledge editing framework. The core innovation of ALEX is its hierarchical memory architecture, which organizes knowledge updates (edits) into semantic clusters. This design fundamentally reduces retrieval complexity from a linear O(N) to a highly scalable O(K+N/C). Furthermore, the framework integrates an Inferential Query Synthesis (IQS) module to bridge the semantic gap between queries and facts , and a Dynamic Evidence Adjudication (DEA) engine that executes an efficient two-stage retrieval process. Experiments on the MQUAKE benchmark demonstrate that ALEX significantly improves both the accuracy of multi-hop answers (MultiHop-ACC) and the reliability of reasoning paths (HopWise-ACC). It also reduces the required search space by over 80% , presenting a promising path toward building scalable, efficient, and accurate knowledge editing systems.

Motivation: 大规模伤亡事件中的分类决策至关重要，但真实数据难以收集，限制了AI模型的开发。需要足够数量和质量的基准数据集来评估AI性能。

Method: 开发Syn-STARTS框架，利用大型语言模型生成分类案例，并与手动整理的TRIAGE开放数据集进行定性比较验证。

Result: Syn-STARTS生成的分类案例在质量上与手动整理的数据集无法区分，使用START标准方法评估LLM准确性时，在绿色、黄色、红色和黑色类别中表现出高度稳定性。

Conclusion: 合成数据在开发用于严重和危急医疗情况的高性能AI模型中具有巨大潜力，可以解决真实数据收集困难的问题。

Abstract: Triage is a critically important decision-making process in mass casualty incidents (MCIs) to maximize victim survival rates. While the role of AI in such situations is gaining attention for making optimal decisions within limited resources and time, its development and performance evaluation require benchmark datasets of sufficient quantity and quality. However, MCIs occur infrequently, and sufficient records are difficult to accumulate at the scene, making it challenging to collect large-scale realworld data for research use. Therefore, we developed Syn-STARTS, a framework that uses LLMs to generate triage cases, and verified its effectiveness. The results showed that the triage cases generated by Syn-STARTS were qualitatively indistinguishable from the TRIAGE open dataset generated by manual curation from training materials. Furthermore, when evaluating the LLM accuracy using hundreds of cases each from the green, yellow, red, and black categories defined by the standard triage method START, the results were found to be highly stable. This strongly indicates the possibility of synthetic data in developing high-performance AI models for severe and critical medical situations.

Each role is defined through custom system prompts that enforce structured JSON outputs. A hybrid memory approach (FAISS + SQLite) enables both semantic retrieval and structured conversation history. An incremental indexing strategy based on file hashing minimizes redundant re-embedding when scientific corpora evolve. A configuration-driven project bootstrap layer allows research teams to customize tools, prompts, and data sources without modifying core code.
  All agent decisions, tool invocations, and retrievals are logged and visualized through a custom Gradio interface, providing step-by-step transparency for each reasoning episode. The authors have applied AISAC to multiple research areas at Argonne, including specialized deployments for waste-to-products research and energy process safety, as well as general-purpose scientific assistance, demonstrating its cross-domain applicability.

### [195] [Making Evidence Actionable in Adaptive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14052)
*Amirreza Mehrabi,Jason W. Morphew,Breejha Quezada,N. Sanjay Rebello*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种由教师主导的反馈循环系统，将概念级评估证据转化为经过验证的微干预措施，通过三种保障机制（充分性、注意力预算、多样性）实现自适应学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自适应学习系统诊断精准但干预薄弱，导致帮助时机不当或内容不匹配，需要建立更有效的诊断-教学闭环。

Method: 将干预分配形式化为带约束的二元整数规划，包含覆盖率、时间、难度窗口、先决条件和反冗余约束。采用贪心选择、基于梯度的松弛和混合方法三种求解策略。

Result: 在1204名学生的物理课程部署中，两种求解器都能在有限观看时间内实现几乎所有学习者的完整技能覆盖。基于梯度的方法比贪心方法减少约12%的冗余覆盖，并在难度分布上更均衡。

Conclusion: 该系统提供了一个可追踪和可审计的控制器，能够关闭诊断-教学循环，在课堂规模上实现公平且负载感知的个性化教学。

Abstract: Adaptive learning often diagnoses precisely yet intervenes weakly, yielding help that is mistimed or misaligned. This study presents evidence supporting an instructor-governed feedback loop that converts concept-level assessment evidence into vetted micro-interventions. The adaptive learning algorithm contains three safeguards: adequacy as a hard guarantee of gap closure, attention as a budgeted constraint for time and redundancy, and diversity as protection against overfitting to a single resource. We formalize intervention assignment as a binary integer program with constraints for coverage, time, difficulty windows informed by ability estimates, prerequisites encoded by a concept matrix, and anti-redundancy enforced through diversity. Greedy selection serves low-richness and tight-latency regimes, gradient-based relaxation serves rich repositories, and a hybrid method transitions along a richness-latency frontier. In simulation and in an introductory physics deployment with one thousand two hundred four students, both solvers achieved full skill coverage for essentially all learners within bounded watch time. The gradient-based method reduced redundant coverage by approximately twelve percentage points relative to greedy and harmonized difficulty across slates, while greedy delivered comparable adequacy with lower computational cost in scarce settings. Slack variables localized missing content and supported targeted curation, sustaining sufficiency across subgroups. The result is a tractable and auditable controller that closes the diagnostic-pedagogical loop and delivers equitable, load-aware personalization at classroom scale.

TL;DR: 本文研究了交互式LLM网络在协作问答中的幻觉传播问题，结合平均场动力学和随机效用模型构建生成模型，分析了网络结构、数据异质性等因素对幻觉扩散的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在缺乏直接证据时容易产生幻觉，这种效应在交互式LLM网络中会加剧，导致原本准确的LLM也开始产生幻觉，需要研究这种幻觉传播机制。

Method: 结合网络科学的平均场动力学和经济学随机效用模型，构建LLM网络生成模型，将LLM建模为具有潜在状态（真实/幻觉）的节点，分析有向网络中的信息扩散。

Result: 为具有两种潜在状态的LLM网络提出了固定点存在性和唯一性的充分条件，分析了个体LLM激励对固定点行为的影响，并在100个开源LLM网络上进行了实验验证。

Conclusion: LLM网络中的幻觉传播可以通过平均场动力学和随机效用模型有效建模，网络结构、数据异质性和节点能力等因素显著影响幻觉扩散行为。

Abstract: In this paper, we model and analyze how a network of interacting LLMs performs collaborative question-answering (CQA) in order to estimate a ground truth given a distributed set of documents. This problem is interesting because LLMs often hallucinate when direct evidence to answer a question is lacking, and these effects become more pronounced in a network of interacting LLMs. The hallucination spreads, causing previously accurate LLMs to hallucinate. We study interacting LLMs and their hallucination by combining novel ideas of mean-field dynamics (MFD) from network science and the randomized utility model from economics to construct a useful generative model. We model the LLM with a latent state that indicates if it is truthful or not with respect to the ground truth, and extend a tractable analytical model considering an MFD to model the diffusion of information in a directed network of LLMs. To specify the probabilities that govern the dynamics of the MFD, we propose a randomized utility model. For a network of LLMs, where each LLM has two possible latent states, we posit sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a fixed point and analyze the behavior of the fixed point in terms of the incentive (e.g., test-time compute) given to individual LLMs. We experimentally study and analyze the behavior of a network of $100$ open-source LLMs with respect to data heterogeneity, node capability, network structure, and sensitivity to framing on multiple semi-synthetic datasets.

TL;DR: APD-agents是一个基于大语言模型的多智能体框架，用于自动化移动应用页面设计，通过多个专业代理协同工作将用户描述转换为完整的页面布局。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动应用页面布局设计耗时且需要专业技能，现有设计软件学习成本高，跨页面协作设计需要额外时间统一标准。

Method: 使用包含OrchestratorAgent、SemanticParserAgent、PrimaryLayoutAgent、TemplateRetrievalAgent和RecursiveComponentAgent的多智能体框架，各代理分工协作完成从用户描述到页面布局的转换。

Result: 在RICO数据集上的实验结果表明，APD-agents达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: 该工作充分利用了大模型驱动的多智能体系统的自动协作能力，实现了高效的自动化页面设计。

Abstract: Layout design is a crucial step in developing mobile app pages. However, crafting satisfactory designs is time-intensive for designers: they need to consider which controls and content to present on the page, and then repeatedly adjust their size, position, and style for better aesthetics and structure. Although many design software can now help to perform these repetitive tasks, extensive training is needed to use them effectively. Moreover, collaborative design across app pages demands extra time to align standards and ensure consistent styling. In this work, we propose APD-agents, a large language model (LLM) driven multi-agent framework for automated page design in mobile applications. Our framework contains OrchestratorAgent, SemanticParserAgent, PrimaryLayoutAgent, TemplateRetrievalAgent, and RecursiveComponentAgent. Upon receiving the user's description of the page, the OrchestratorAgent can dynamically can direct other agents to accomplish users' design task. To be specific, the SemanticParserAgent is responsible for converting users' descriptions of page content into structured data. The PrimaryLayoutAgent can generate an initial coarse-grained layout of this page. The TemplateRetrievalAgent can fetch semantically relevant few-shot examples and enhance the quality of layout generation. Besides, a RecursiveComponentAgent can be used to decide how to recursively generate all the fine-grained sub-elements it contains for each element in the layout. Our work fully leverages the automatic collaboration capabilities of large-model-driven multi-agent systems. Experimental results on the RICO dataset show that our APD-agents achieve state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: PRISM的模块化、仅推理设计使其适用于实际应用场景，为金融信息检索提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of large language models (LLMs), financial information retrieval has become a critical industrial application. Extracting task-relevant information from lengthy financial filings is essential for both operational and analytical decision-making. The FinAgentBench dataset formalizes this problem through two tasks: document ranking and chunk ranking. We present PRISM, a training-free framework that integrates refined system prompting, in-context learning (ICL), and a lightweight multi-agent system. Each component is examined extensively to reveal their synergies: prompt engineering provides precise task instructions, ICL supplies semantically relevant few-shot examples, and the multi-agent system models coordinated scoring behaviour. Our best configuration achieves an NDCG@5 of 0.71818 on the restricted validation split. We further demonstrate that PRISM is feasible and robust for production-scale financial retrieval. Its modular, inference-only design makes it practical for real-world use cases. The source code is released at https://bit.ly/prism-ailens.

Motivation: 解决LLM在视觉语言导航中理解真实世界空间关系困难、计算成本高和推理延迟大的问题，同时弥补LLM方法与领域专家之间的性能差距。

Method: 设计R3框架：Runner（轻量级专家模型负责常规导航）、Ruminator（多模态LLM进行结构化推理）、Regulator（监控进度并控制思维模式）。

Result: 在REVERIE基准上SPL和RGSPL分别提升3.28%和3.30%，显著优于其他最先进方法。

Conclusion: R3框架有效处理具有挑战性的VLN任务，证明了将LLM泛化能力与领域专业知识结合的优越性。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to dynamically explore complex 3D environments following human instructions. Recent research underscores the potential of harnessing large language models (LLMs) for VLN, given their commonsense knowledge and general reasoning capabilities. Despite their strengths, a substantial gap in task completion performance persists between LLM-based approaches and domain experts, as LLMs inherently struggle to comprehend real-world spatial correlations precisely. Additionally, introducing LLMs is accompanied with substantial computational cost and inference latency. To address these issues, we propose a novel dual-process thinking framework dubbed R3, integrating LLMs' generalization capabilities with VLN-specific expertise in a zero-shot manner. The framework comprises three core modules: Runner, Ruminator, and Regulator. The Runner is a lightweight transformer-based expert model that ensures efficient and accurate navigation under regular circumstances. The Ruminator employs a powerful multimodal LLM as the backbone and adopts chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to elicit structured reasoning. The Regulator monitors the navigation progress and controls the appropriate thinking mode according to three criteria, integrating Runner and Ruminator harmoniously. Experimental results illustrate that R3 significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, exceeding 3.28% and 3.30% in SPL and RGSPL respectively on the REVERIE benchmark. This pronounced enhancement highlights the effectiveness of our method in handling challenging VLN tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了CLEAR评估框架，针对企业AI代理的部署需求，弥补现有基准在成本效率、可靠性和操作稳定性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI代理基准主要评估任务完成准确性，但忽视了企业部署的关键需求，如成本效率、可靠性和操作稳定性。

Method: 通过系统分析12个主要基准和实证评估最先进的代理，识别了三个基本限制，并提出了CLEAR（成本、延迟、效能、保证、可靠性）评估框架。

Result: 在300个企业任务上评估六个领先代理，发现仅优化准确性的代理比成本感知替代方案贵4.4-10.8倍。专家评估确认CLEAR能更好预测生产成功（ρ=0.83 vs 仅准确性评估的ρ=0.41）。

Conclusion: CLEAR框架为企业AI代理部署提供了更全面的评估标准，显著优于仅关注准确性的传统评估方法。

Abstract: Current agentic AI benchmarks predominantly evaluate task completion accuracy, while overlooking critical enterprise requirements such as cost-efficiency, reliability, and operational stability. Through systematic analysis of 12 main benchmarks and empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art agents, we identify three fundamental limitations: (1) absence of cost-controlled evaluation leading to 50x cost variations for similar precision, (2) inadequate reliability assessment where agent performance drops from 60\% (single run) to 25\% (8-run consistency), and (3) missing multidimensional metrics for security, latency, and policy compliance. We propose \textbf{CLEAR} (Cost, Latency, Efficacy, Assurance, Reliability), a holistic evaluation framework specifically designed for enterprise deployment. Evaluation of six leading agents on 300 enterprise tasks demonstrates that optimizing for accuracy alone yields agents 4.4-10.8x more expensive than cost-aware alternatives with comparable performance. Expert evaluation (N=15) confirms that CLEAR better predicts production success (correlation $ρ=0.83$) compared to accuracy-only evaluation ($ρ=0.41$).

Method: 提出HFL-FlowLLM框架，将大语言模型应用于异构联邦学习中的网络流量分类任务。

Result: 相比最先进的异构联邦学习方法，平均F1分数提升约13%；相比现有大语言模型联邦学习框架，在增加客户端数量时F1分数提升达5%，训练成本降低约87%。

Conclusion: HFL-FlowLLM在现代通信网络安全中具有潜力和实用价值。

Abstract: In modern communication networks driven by 5G and the Internet of Things (IoT), effective network traffic flow classification is crucial for Quality of Service (QoS) management and security. Traditional centralized machine learning struggles with the distributed data and privacy concerns in these heterogeneous environments, while existing federated learning approaches suffer from high costs and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we propose HFL-FlowLLM, which to our knowledge is the first framework to apply large language models to network traffic flow classification in heterogeneous federated learning. Compared to state-of-the-art heterogeneous federated learning methods for network traffic flow classification, the proposed approach improves the average F1 score by approximately 13%, demonstrating compelling performance and strong robustness. When compared to existing large language models federated learning frameworks, as the number of clients participating in each training round increases, the proposed method achieves up to a 5% improvement in average F1 score while reducing the training costs by about 87%. These findings prove the potential and practical value of HFL-FlowLLM in modern communication networks security.

TL;DR: LLMs在金融应用中存在时间顺序理解问题，本文通过三种时序任务测试发现：随着序列长度增加，准确率显著下降；条件排序失败主要源于筛选步骤；异常时序检测相对容易但性能仍会下降；显式分配推理预算能显著改善性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试LLMs是否真正理解时间顺序，因为金融应用中基于提示的方法隐含假设模型理解时间顺序，但这一基本问题尚未得到验证。

Method: 设计了三种时序任务：时间顺序排序、条件排序（先筛选后排序）和异常时序检测，在GPT-4.1、Claude-3.7 Sonnet（有/无扩展思维）和GPT-5上测试不同推理努力设置。

Result: 随着序列长度增加，精确匹配率急剧下降；条件排序失败主要来自筛选步骤；异常时序检测是最简单的任务但性能仍会下降；GPT-5在中/高推理努力下能实现完美排序和条件排序。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在时序任务上存在局限性，显式分配推理预算能显著改善性能，这对LLMs在金融领域的实时应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in finance and economics, where prompt-based attempts against look-ahead bias implicitly assume that models understand chronology. We test this fundamental question with a series of chronological ordering tasks with increasing complexities over facts the model already knows from pre-training. Our tasks cover (1) chronological ordering, (2) conditional sorting (filter, then order), and (3) anachronism detection. We evaluate GPT-4.1, Claude-3.7 Sonnet, with and without Extended Thinking (ET), and GPT-5 across multiple reasoning-effort settings. Across models, Exact match rate drops sharply as sequences lengthen even while rank correlations stay high as LLMs largely preserve local order but struggle to maintain a single globally consistent timeline. In conditional sorting, most failures stem from the filtering step rather than the ordering step, but GPT-5 and Claude-3.7 Sonnet with Extended Thinking outshine normal models significantly. Lastly, anachronism detection is found to be the easiest task for the LLMs but performance still declines with increasingly overlapping timelines or entities. Overall, our main contribution is showing that allocating explicit reasoning budget helps with chronological ordering with GPT-5 at medium/high reasoning effort achieving flawless ordering at all lengths and perfect conditional sorting (both self-filtered and given-subset), whereas low/minimal effort degrades with longer lists, mirroring earlier models. Our findings delineate limits of current LLMs on chronological tasks, providing insights into task complexity, and demonstrate scenarios in which reasoning helps. These patterns are important for the real-time application of LLMs in finance. We release all code and evaluation templates to support full reproducibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Whisper模型在噪声声学条件下经常出现幻觉错误，而直接修改Whisper模型本身来减轻幻觉的研究仍较少探索

Method: 1. 自适应层注意力(ALA)：通过层间相关性分析将编码器层分组为语义连贯块，使用可学习多头注意力模块融合块表示；2. 多目标知识蒸馏(KD)：在噪声音频上训练学生模型，使其语义和注意力分布与处理干净输入的教师模型对齐

Result: 在噪声语音基准测试中显著减少了幻觉和词错误率，同时保持了在干净语音上的性能

Conclusion: ALA和KD共同提供了一个原则性策略，可在真实世界噪声条件下提高Whisper的可靠性

Abstract: The Whisper model, an open-source automatic speech recognition system, is widely adopted for its strong performance across multilingual and zero-shot settings. However, it frequently suffers from hallucination errors, especially under noisy acoustic conditions. Previous works to reduce hallucinations in Whisper-style ASR systems have primarily focused on audio preprocessing or post-processing of transcriptions to filter out erroneous content. However, modifications to the Whisper model itself remain largely unexplored to mitigate hallucinations directly. To address this challenge, we present a two-stage architecture that first enhances encoder robustness through Adaptive Layer Attention (ALA) and further suppresses hallucinations using a multi-objective knowledge distillation (KD) framework. In the first stage, ALA groups encoder layers into semantically coherent blocks via inter-layer correlation analysis. A learnable multi-head attention module then fuses these block representations, enabling the model to jointly exploit low- and high-level features for more robust encoding. In the second stage, our KD framework trains the student model on noisy audio to align its semantic and attention distributions with a teacher model processing clean inputs. Our experiments on noisy speech benchmarks show notable reductions in hallucinations and word error rates, while preserving performance on clean speech. Together, ALA and KD offer a principled strategy to improve Whisper's reliability under real-world noisy conditions.

Abstract: Operation recommendation for IoT devices refers to generating personalized device operations for users based on their context, such as historical operations, environment information, and device status. This task is crucial for enhancing user satisfaction and corporate profits. Existing recommendation models struggle with complex operation logic, diverse user preferences, and sensitive to suboptimal suggestions, limiting their applicability to IoT device operations. To address these issues, we propose DevPiolt, a LLM-based recommendation model for IoT device operations. Specifically, we first equip the LLM with fundamental domain knowledge of IoT operations via continual pre-training and multi-task fine-tuning. Then, we employ direct preference optimization to align the fine-tuned LLM with specific user preferences. Finally, we design a confidence-based exposure control mechanism to avoid negative user experiences from low-quality recommendations. Extensive experiments show that DevPiolt significantly outperforms baselines on all datasets, with an average improvement of 69.5% across all metrics. DevPiolt has been practically deployed in Xiaomi Home app for one quarter, providing daily operation recommendations to 255,000 users. Online experiment results indicate a 21.6% increase in unique visitor device coverage and a 29.1% increase in page view acceptance rates.

Abstract: The expansion of short-term rental platforms, such as Airbnb, has significantly disrupted local housing markets, often leading to increased rental prices and housing affordability issues. Accurately forecasting regional Airbnb market trends can thus offer critical insights for policymakers and urban planners aiming to mitigate these impacts. This study proposes a novel time-series forecasting framework to predict three key Airbnb indicators -- Revenue, Reservation Days, and Number of Reservations -- at the regional level. Using a sliding-window approach, the model forecasts trends 1 to 3 months ahead. Unlike prior studies that focus on individual listings at fixed time points, our approach constructs regional representations by integrating listing features with external contextual factors such as urban accessibility and human mobility. We convert structured tabular data into prompt-based inputs for a Large Language Model (LLM), producing comprehensive regional embeddings. These embeddings are then fed into advanced time-series models (RNN, LSTM, Transformer) to better capture complex spatio-temporal dynamics. Experiments on Seoul's Airbnb dataset show that our method reduces both average RMSE and MAE by approximately 48% compared to conventional baselines, including traditional statistical and machine learning models. Our framework not only improves forecasting accuracy but also offers practical insights for detecting oversupplied regions and supporting data-driven urban policy decisions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的知识图谱推理方法存在两个关键局限：一是无差别提取推理路径可能引入无关噪声误导LLM；二是动态探索推理路径需要高检索需求和频繁LLM调用。

Method: 采用"检索-优先化-推理"范式：首先检索查询子图，然后通过语义感知路径优先级函数识别重要推理路径（同时考虑累积成本和估计未来成本），最后通过双阶段训练策略（任务特定指令调优和路径偏好对齐）生成准确响应。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，PathMind始终优于竞争基线，特别是在复杂推理任务中，通过识别关键推理路径实现了更好的性能。

Conclusion: PathMind通过选择性路径引导机制，在减少输入标记的同时提升了知识图谱推理的准确性和逻辑一致性，为LLM在复杂推理任务中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge graph reasoning (KGR) is the task of inferring new knowledge by performing logical deductions on knowledge graphs. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in complex reasoning tasks. Despite promising success, current LLM-based KGR methods still face two critical limitations. First, existing methods often extract reasoning paths indiscriminately, without assessing their different importance, which may introduce irrelevant noise that misleads LLMs. Second, while many methods leverage LLMs to dynamically explore potential reasoning paths, they require high retrieval demands and frequent LLM calls. To address these limitations, we propose PathMind, a novel framework designed to enhance faithful and interpretable reasoning by selectively guiding LLMs with important reasoning paths. Specifically, PathMind follows a "Retrieve-Prioritize-Reason" paradigm. First, it retrieves a query subgraph from KG through the retrieval module. Next, it introduces a path prioritization mechanism that identifies important reasoning paths using a semantic-aware path priority function, which simultaneously considers the accumulative cost and the estimated future cost for reaching the target. Finally, PathMind generates accurate and logically consistent responses via a dual-phase training strategy, including task-specific instruction tuning and path-wise preference alignment. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PathMind consistently outperforms competitive baselines, particularly on complex reasoning tasks with fewer input tokens, by identifying essential reasoning paths.

Conclusion: DataSage为自动化数据洞察发现提供了一个有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In today's data-driven era, fully automated end-to-end data analytics, particularly insight discovery, is critical for discovering actionable insights that assist organizations in making effective decisions. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), LLM-driven agents have emerged as a promising paradigm for automating data analysis and insight discovery. However, existing data insight agents remain limited in several key aspects, often failing to deliver satisfactory results due to: (1) insufficient utilization of domain knowledge, (2) shallow analytical depth, and (3) error-prone code generation during insight generation. To address these issues, we propose DataSage, a novel multi-agent framework that incorporates three innovative features including external knowledge retrieval to enrich the analytical context, a multi-role debating mechanism to simulate diverse analytical perspectives and deepen analytical depth, and multi-path reasoning to improve the accuracy of the generated code and insights. Extensive experiments on InsightBench demonstrate that DataSage consistently outperforms existing data insight agents across all difficulty levels, offering an effective solution for automated data insight discovery.

TL;DR: LLMs在自动生成优化和约束编程模型方面表现看似出色，但实际上可能主要源于训练数据中的问题泄露而非真正的推理能力。通过系统性地改写和扰动标准CSPLib问题，研究发现LLMs在上下文和语言变化下性能急剧下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检验LLMs在自动生成优化模型方面的真实能力，区分其表现是源于数据污染还是真正的推理能力。

Method: 系统性地重述和扰动一组著名的CSPLib问题，保持问题结构不变但改变上下文并引入误导元素，然后比较三个代表性LLM在原始和修改描述下的模型生成表现。

Result: LLMs能够生成语法有效且语义合理的模型，但在上下文和语言变化下性能急剧下降，显示出浅层理解和对措辞的敏感性。

Conclusion: LLMs对优化问题的理解是浅层的，其表现很大程度上依赖于训练数据中的特定措辞和上下文，而非真正的推理能力。

Abstract: One of the long-standing goals in optimisation and constraint programming is to describe a problem in natural language and automatically obtain an executable, efficient model. Large language models appear to bring this vision closer, showing impressive results in automatically generating models for classical benchmarks. However, much of this apparent success may derive from data contamination rather than genuine reasoning: many standard CP problems are likely included in the training data of these models. To examine this hypothesis, we systematically rephrased and perturbed a set of well-known CSPLib problems to preserve their structure while modifying their context and introducing misleading elements. We then compared the models produced by three representative LLMs across original and modified descriptions. Our qualitative analysis shows that while LLMs can produce syntactically valid and semantically plausible models, their performance drops sharply under contextual and linguistic variation, revealing shallow understanding and sensitivity to wording.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了在LLM对齐过程中纳入多元化价值观的影响，发现人口统计差异和设计参数会显著影响模型行为，不同社会群体对毒性、情感意识等维度的评价存在系统性差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM对齐决策往往忽视人类社会的多样性，需要研究如何将多元化价值观融入对齐流程以确保安全性和公平代表性。

Method: 收集美国和德国参与者对LLM回复的评分数据，在不同社会群体偏好基础上微调多个大语言模型和大推理模型，并测试不同评分尺度、分歧处理方法和优化技术。

Result: 发现系统性人口统计效应：男性比女性对毒性评分低18%；保守派和黑人参与者比自由派和白人参与者对情感意识评分分别高27.9%和44%。技术设计选择影响显著：保留评分者分歧比多数投票的毒性减少效果高53%；5分制比二元格式减少效果高22%；DPO在多值优化中优于GRPO。

Conclusion: 这是回答关键问题的初步步骤：对齐应如何平衡专家驱动和用户驱动信号，以确保安全性和公平代表性。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained using human feedback for safety and alignment with human values, alignment decisions often overlook human social diversity. This study examines how incorporating pluralistic values affects LLM behavior by systematically evaluating demographic variation and design parameters in the alignment pipeline. We collected alignment data from US and German participants (N = 1,095, 27,375 ratings) who rated LLM responses across five dimensions: Toxicity, Emotional Awareness (EA), Sensitivity, Stereotypical Bias, and Helpfulness. We fine-tuned multiple Large Language Models and Large Reasoning Models using preferences from different social groups while varying rating scales, disagreement handling methods, and optimization techniques. The results revealed systematic demographic effects: male participants rated responses 18% less toxic than female participants; conservative and Black participants rated responses 27.9% and 44% more emotionally aware than liberal and White participants, respectively. Models fine-tuned on group-specific preferences exhibited distinct behaviors. Technical design choices showed strong effects: the preservation of rater disagreement achieved roughly 53% greater toxicity reduction than majority voting, and 5-point scales yielded about 22% more reduction than binary formats; and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) consistently outperformed Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in multi-value optimization. These findings represent a preliminary step in answering a critical question: How should alignment balance expert-driven and user-driven signals to ensure both safety and fair representation?

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在不确定性环境下，连接连续感知信号和离散符号推理是AI系统面临的基本挑战。需要建立感知和规划两个抽象层次之间的原则性连接。

Method: 结合基于transformer的感知前端和图神经网络关系推理，从视觉观察中提取概率符号状态，并使用不确定性感知的符号规划器在置信度低时主动收集信息。

Result: 在10,047个PyBullet生成的场景（3-10个物体）上处理，输出具有校准置信度的概率谓词（总体F1=0.68）。在规划器中嵌入后，在Simple Stack、Deep Stack和Clear+Stack基准测试中分别达到94%/90%/88%的成功率（平均90.7%），比最强POMDP基线高出10-14点，规划时间在15ms内。

Conclusion: 该框架建立了校准不确定性与规划收敛之间的定量联系，提供了理论保证并通过实证验证。该通用框架可应用于任何需要从感知输入到符号规划的不确定性感知推理领域。

Abstract: Bridging continuous perceptual signals and discrete symbolic reasoning is a fundamental challenge in AI systems that must operate under uncertainty. We present a neuro-symbolic framework that explicitly models and propagates uncertainty from perception to planning, providing a principled connection between these two abstraction levels. Our approach couples a transformer-based perceptual front-end with graph neural network (GNN) relational reasoning to extract probabilistic symbolic states from visual observations, and an uncertainty-aware symbolic planner that actively gathers information when confidence is low. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness on tabletop robotic manipulation as a concrete application: the translator processes 10,047 PyBullet-generated scenes (3--10 objects) and outputs probabilistic predicates with calibrated confidences (overall F1=0.68). When embedded in the planner, the system achieves 94\%/90\%/88\% success on Simple Stack, Deep Stack, and Clear+Stack benchmarks (90.7\% average), exceeding the strongest POMDP baseline by 10--14 points while planning within 15\,ms. A probabilistic graphical-model analysis establishes a quantitative link between calibrated uncertainty and planning convergence, providing theoretical guarantees that are validated empirically. The framework is general-purpose and can be applied to any domain requiring uncertainty-aware reasoning from perceptual input to symbolic planning.

Motivation: 将非结构化教育材料（如讲义和幻灯片）转换为能捕捉关键教学内容的知识图谱仍然很困难，需要一种原则性的方法来构建和优化任务导向的知识图谱

Conclusion: 这项研究为个性化教育和AI辅助教育中的信息论知识图谱优化建立了原则性基础

Abstract: Task-oriented knowledge graphs (KGs) enable AI-powered learning assistant systems to automatically generate high-quality multiple-choice questions (MCQs). Yet converting unstructured educational materials, such as lecture notes and slides, into KGs that capture key pedagogical content remains difficult. We propose a framework for knowledge graph construction and refinement grounded in rate-distortion (RD) theory and optimal transport geometry. In the framework, lecture content is modeled as a metric-measure space, capturing semantic and relational structure, while candidate KGs are aligned using Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) couplings to quantify semantic distortion. The rate term, expressed via the size of KG, reflects complexity and compactness. Refinement operators (add, merge, split, remove, rewire) minimize the rate-distortion Lagrangian, yielding compact, information-preserving KGs. Our prototype applied to data science lectures yields interpretable RD curves and shows that MCQs generated from refined KGs consistently surpass those from raw notes on fifteen quality criteria. This study establishes a principled foundation for information-theoretic KG optimization in personalized and AI-assisted education.

TL;DR: AutoTool是一个基于图的框架，通过利用工具使用惯性来减少LLM代理的推理成本，无需重复调用LLM进行工具选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM代理框架中工具选择的高推理成本是一个主要瓶颈，特别是像ReAct这样需要反复调用LLM来确定每个步骤使用哪个工具的方法。

Method: 构建基于历史代理轨迹的有向图，节点代表工具，边捕获转移概率，建模工具选择的惯性，并集成参数级信息来优化工具输入生成。

Result: 在多样化代理任务上的实验表明，AutoTool可将推理成本降低高达30%，同时保持竞争力的任务完成率。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了将统计结构集成到LLM代理设计中的潜力，可以在不牺牲性能的情况下实现更高的效率。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have emerged as powerful tools for automating complex tasks by leveraging the reasoning and decision-making abilities of LLMs. However, a major bottleneck in current agent frameworks lies in the high inference cost of tool selection, especially in approaches like ReAct that repeatedly invoke the LLM to determine which tool to use at each step. In this work, we propose AutoTool, a novel graph-based framework that bypasses repeated LLM inference by exploiting a key empirical observation: tool usage inertia - the tendency of tool invocations to follow predictable sequential patterns. AutoTool constructs a directed graph from historical agent trajectories, where nodes represent tools and edges capture transition probabilities, effectively modeling the inertia in tool selection. It further integrates parameter-level information to refine tool input generation. By traversing this structured representation, AutoTool efficiently selects tools and their parameters with minimal reliance on LLM inference. Extensive experiments across diverse agent tasks demonstrate that AutoTool reduces inference costs by up to 30% while maintaining competitive task completion rates, offering a practical and scalable enhancement for inference-heavy frameworks. Our work highlights the promise of integrating statistical structure into LLM agent design for greater efficiency without sacrificing performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ICL方法难以同时满足三个关键原则：关注决策关键信息、提供步骤级粒度、减少对专家标注的依赖。

Method: 构建动作中心的领域级图，通过时间差分信用分配识别高效用动作，检索步骤级技能生成细粒度的上下文感知提示。

Result: 在ALFWorld、BabyAI和ScienceWorld上的实验显示，SkillGen平均提升进度率5.9%-16.5%，在开源和专有LLM上均取得一致增益。

Conclusion: 关注高效用片段支持任务可识别性，并为更有效的ICL提示设计提供信息，SkillGen框架在结构化顺序推理中表现优异。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to sequential decision-making through in-context learning (ICL), yet their effectiveness is highly sensitive to prompt quality. Effective prompts should meet three principles: focus on decision-critical information, provide step-level granularity, and minimize reliance on expert annotations through label efficiency. However, existing ICL methods often fail to satisfy all three criteria simultaneously. Motivated by these challenges, we introduce SkillGen, a skill-based ICL framework for structured sequential reasoning. It constructs an action-centric, domain-level graph from sampled trajectories, identifies high-utility actions via temporal-difference credit assignment, and retrieves step-wise skills to generate fine-grained, context-aware prompts. We further present a theoretical analysis showing that focusing on high-utility segments supports task identifiability and informs more effective ICL prompt design. Experiments on ALFWorld, BabyAI, and ScienceWorld, using both open-source and proprietary LLMs, show that SkillGen achieves consistent gains, improving progress rate by 5.9%-16.5% on average across models.

TL;DR: 本文应用异构智能体强化学习框架解决电力配电网恢复问题，通过HAPPO算法实现互联微电网的协调恢复，相比传统方法具有更快的收敛速度和更高的恢复效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模停电后恢复电力配电网需要处理非线性约束下的顺序开关操作和分布式能源资源协调，传统优化方法和基于价值的强化学习方法计算效率低且难以扩展。

Method: 采用异构智能体近端策略优化框架，每个智能体控制具有不同负载、DER容量和开关数量的微电网，使用去中心化的行动者策略和集中化的评论家进行训练，通过物理信息化的OpenDSS环境提供完整潮流反馈。

Result: 在IEEE 123总线和IEEE 8500节点系统上的实验表明，HAPPO相比DQN、PPO、MAES等算法具有更快的收敛速度、更高的恢复功率和更平滑的多种子训练效果。

Conclusion: 在HARL框架中引入微电网级异构性，为复杂电力配电网恢复问题提供了可扩展、稳定且约束感知的解决方案。

Abstract: Restoring power distribution systems (PDS) after large-scale outages requires sequential switching operations that reconfigure feeder topology and coordinate distributed energy resources (DERs) under nonlinear constraints such as power balance, voltage limits, and thermal ratings. These challenges make conventional optimization and value-based RL approaches computationally inefficient and difficult to scale. This paper applies a Heterogeneous-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HARL) framework, instantiated through Heterogeneous-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (HAPPO), to enable coordinated restoration across interconnected microgrids. Each agent controls a distinct microgrid with different loads, DER capacities, and switch counts, introducing practical structural heterogeneity. Decentralized actor policies are trained with a centralized critic to compute advantage values for stable on-policy updates. A physics-informed OpenDSS environment provides full power flow feedback and enforces operational limits via differentiable penalty signals rather than invalid action masking. The total DER generation is capped at 2400 kW, and each microgrid must satisfy local supply-demand feasibility. Experiments on the IEEE 123-bus and IEEE 8500-node systems show that HAPPO achieves faster convergence, higher restored power, and smoother multi-seed training than DQN, PPO, MAES, MAGDPG, MADQN, Mean-Field RL, and QMIX. Results demonstrate that incorporating microgrid-level heterogeneity within the HARL framework yields a scalable, stable, and constraint-aware solution for complex PDS restoration.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: B2F模型根据身体动作和面部风格参考生成协调的面部动画，通过解耦内容与风格表示，使用对齐和一致性目标，输出兼容SMPL-X的FLAME格式面部运动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类运动自然整合身体动作和面部表情，形成统一感知。虚拟角色面部表情与身体动作不协调会削弱角色整体感知，因此需要生成与身体动作对齐的面部运动。

Result: B2F生成富有表现力和吸引力的面部动画，与身体动作和风格意图同步，减轻不匹配线索引起的感知失调，并在不同角色和风格上具有良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: B2F模型成功实现了与身体动作协调的面部动画生成，通过解耦表示和结构化潜在空间，解决了虚拟角色面部与身体动作不匹配的问题，提升了角色整体感知一致性。

Abstract: Human motion naturally integrates body movements and facial expressions, forming a unified perception. If a virtual character's facial expression does not align well with its body movements, it may weaken the perception of the character as a cohesive whole. Motivated by this, we propose B2F, a model that generates facial motions aligned with body movements. B2F takes a facial style reference as input, generating facial animations that reflect the provided style while maintaining consistency with the associated body motion. To achieve this, B2F learns a disentangled representation of content and style, using alignment and consistency-based objectives. We represent style using discrete latent codes learned via the Gumbel-Softmax trick, enabling diverse expression generation with a structured latent representation. B2F outputs facial motion in the FLAME format, making it compatible with SMPL-X characters, and supports ARKit-style avatars through a dedicated conversion module. Our evaluations show that B2F generates expressive and engaging facial animations that synchronize with body movements and style intent, while mitigating perceptual dissonance from mismatched cues, and generalizing across diverse characters and styles.

TL;DR: FreeMusco是一个无需运动数据的框架，通过联合学习潜在表示和控制策略，实现肌肉骨骼角色的能量感知和形态自适应运动。该方法利用肌肉骨骼模型作为强先验，在不同形态上自然产生能量高效的运动策略。

Motivation: 传统方法依赖运动捕捉数据，但在某些角色（如非人类或合成形态）中数据收集不现实。本文旨在开发无需运动数据即可生成多样化、物理合理的运动控制方法。

Method: 使用基于模型的强化学习，结合控制、平衡和生物力学目标。引入时间平均损失公式捕捉自然步态的周期性结构，并通过随机化目标姿态和能量水平鼓励行为多样性。

Result: 框架在人类、非人类和合成形态上均能生成能量高效的运动策略（如Chimanoid的四足步态和Humanoid的双足步态），支持目标导航和路径跟随等下游任务。

Conclusion: FreeMusco证明了无需运动捕捉数据即可实现多功能自适应运动控制，为数据收集困难或不可行的角色运动模拟提供了新方向。

Abstract: We propose FreeMusco, a motion-free framework that jointly learns latent representations and control policies for musculoskeletal characters. By leveraging the musculoskeletal model as a strong prior, our method enables energy-aware and morphology-adaptive locomotion to emerge without motion data. The framework generalizes across human, non-human, and synthetic morphologies, where distinct energy-efficient strategies naturally appear--for example, quadrupedal gaits in Chimanoid versus bipedal gaits in Humanoid. The latent space and corresponding control policy are constructed from scratch, without demonstration, and enable downstream tasks such as goal navigation and path following--representing, to our knowledge, the first motion-free method to provide such capabilities. FreeMusco learns diverse and physically plausible locomotion behaviors through model-based reinforcement learning, guided by the locomotion objective that combines control, balancing, and biomechanical terms. To better capture the periodic structure of natural gait, we introduce the temporally averaged loss formulation, which compares simulated and target states over a time window rather than on a per-frame basis. We further encourage behavioral diversity by randomizing target poses and energy levels during training, enabling locomotion to be flexibly modulated in both form and intensity at runtime. Together, these results demonstrate that versatile and adaptive locomotion control can emerge without motion capture, offering a new direction for simulating movement in characters where data collection is impractical or impossible.

Conclusion: XPINN框架是解决多相流问题中挑战性双曲偏微分方程的有效且可扩展工具，使用更小、特定领域的模型和更少的可训练参数。

Abstract: The accurate solution of nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) remains a central challenge in computational science due to the presence of steep gradients, discontinuities, and multiscale structures that make conventional discretization-based solvers computationally demanding. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) embed the governing equations into the learning process, enabling mesh-free solution of PDEs, yet they often struggle to capture steep gradients, discontinuities, and complex nonlinear wave interactions. To address these limitations, this study employs the Extended Physics-Informed Neural Network (XPINN) framework to solve the nonlinear Buckley-Leverett equation with a nonconvex flux function, which models immiscible two-phase flow in porous media. The computational domain is dynamically decomposed in space and time into evolving pre-shock and post-shock regions, allowing localized subnetworks to efficiently learn distinct flow behaviors. Coupling between subnetworks is achieved through the Rankine-Hugoniot jump condition, which enforces physically consistent flux continuity across the moving shock interface. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed XPINN approach accurately captures discontinuous saturation fronts and compound wave interactions without requiring artificial diffusion or entropy corrections. Compared to standard PINNs, the XPINN framework achieves superior stability, faster convergence, and enhanced resolution of nonlinear wave dynamics using smaller, domain-specific models with fewer trainable parameters, establishing it as an effective and scalable tool for solving challenging hyperbolic PDEs in multiphase flow problems. The code of this work is available on github.com/saifkhanengr/XPINN-for-Buckley-Leverett.

Conclusion: BLUE方法通过层次化补丁设计有效平衡了细粒度时空细节和整体出行模式的捕捉，在轨迹表示学习任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Trajectory representation learning (TRL) maps trajectories to vector embeddings and facilitates tasks such as trajectory classification and similarity search. State-of-the-art (SOTA) TRL methods transform raw GPS trajectories to grid or road trajectories to capture high-level travel semantics, i.e., regions and roads. However, they lose fine-grained spatial-temporal details as multiple GPS points are grouped into a single grid cell or road segment. To tackle this problem, we propose the BLUrred Encoding method, dubbed BLUE, which gradually reduces the precision of GPS coordinates to create hierarchical patches with multiple levels. The low-level patches are small and preserve fine-grained spatial-temporal details, while the high-level patches are large and capture overall travel patterns. To complement different patch levels with each other, our BLUE is an encoder-decoder model with a pyramid structure. At each patch level, a Transformer is used to learn the trajectory embedding at the current level, while pooling prepares inputs for the higher level in the encoder, and up-resolution provides guidance for the lower level in the decoder. BLUE is trained using the trajectory reconstruction task with the MSE loss. We compare BLUE with 8 SOTA TRL methods for 3 downstream tasks, the results show that BLUE consistently achieves higher accuracy than all baselines, outperforming the best-performing baselines by an average of 30.90%.

Method: 在多个层应用梯度-特征对齐(GFA)正则化，将输入梯度与内部特征表示对齐，促进损失函数在切向方向上的平滑性

Result: 在CIFAR-10上，相比标准对抗训练，APGD攻击下提升15.2%，FGSM攻击下提升24.7%；对抗DeepFool和EADEN攻击需要20-30倍更高的扰动幅度才能导致误分类

Conclusion: 该方法架构无关、实现简单且高效，为提高深度学习模型的对抗鲁棒性提供了有前景的方向

Abstract: Deep neural networks are known to be vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, which are small and carefully crafted inputs that lead to incorrect predictions. In this paper, we propose DeepDefense, a novel defense framework that applies Gradient-Feature Alignment (GFA) regularization across multiple layers to suppress adversarial vulnerability. By aligning input gradients with internal feature representations, DeepDefense promotes a smoother loss landscape in tangential directions, thereby reducing the model's sensitivity to adversarial noise.
  We provide theoretical insights into how adversarial perturbation can be decomposed into radial and tangential components and demonstrate that alignment suppresses loss variation in tangential directions, where most attacks are effective. Empirically, our method achieves significant improvements in robustness across both gradient-based and optimization-based attacks. For example, on CIFAR-10, CNN models trained with DeepDefense outperform standard adversarial training by up to 15.2% under APGD attacks and 24.7% under FGSM attacks. Against optimization-based attacks such as DeepFool and EADEN, DeepDefense requires 20 to 30 times higher perturbation magnitudes to cause misclassification, indicating stronger decision boundaries and a flatter loss landscape. Our approach is architecture-agnostic, simple to implement, and highly effective, offering a promising direction for improving the adversarial robustness of deep learning models.

Motivation: 现有的扩散模型偏见分析方法局限于预定义类别或依赖人工解释，限制了可扩展性并阻碍了发现细微或意外模式的能力。

Method: SCALEX从H空间提取语义方向，仅使用自然语言提示，无需重新训练或标注，实现零样本解释和任意概念的系统比较。

Conclusion: 通过直接将提示与潜在方向关联，SCALEX使扩散模型的偏见分析比先前方法更具可扩展性、可解释性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Image generation models frequently encode social biases, including stereotypes tied to gender, race, and profession. Existing methods for analyzing these biases in diffusion models either focus narrowly on predefined categories or depend on manual interpretation of latent directions. These constraints limit scalability and hinder the discovery of subtle or unanticipated patterns.
  We introduce SCALEX, a framework for scalable and automated exploration of diffusion model latent spaces. SCALEX extracts semantically meaningful directions from H-space using only natural language prompts, enabling zero-shot interpretation without retraining or labelling. This allows systematic comparison across arbitrary concepts and large-scale discovery of internal model associations. We show that SCALEX detects gender bias in profession prompts, ranks semantic alignment across identity descriptors, and reveals clustered conceptual structure without supervision. By linking prompts to latent directions directly, SCALEX makes bias analysis in diffusion models more scalable, interpretable, and extensible than prior approaches.

Abstract: A Brain Computer Interface (BCI) connects the human brain to the outside world, providing a direct communication channel. Electroencephalography (EEG) signals are commonly used in BCIs to reflect cognitive patterns related to motor function activities. However, due to the multichannel nature of EEG signals, explicit information processing is crucial to lessen computational complexity in BCI systems. This study proposes an innovative method based on brain region-specific channel selection and multi-domain feature fusion to improve classification accuracy. The novelty of the proposed approach lies in region-based channel selection, where EEG channels are grouped according to their functional relevance to distinct brain regions. By selecting channels based on specific regions involved in motor imagery (MI) tasks, this technique eliminates irrelevant channels, reducing data dimensionality and improving computational efficiency. This also ensures that the extracted features are more reflective of the brain actual activity related to motor tasks. Three distinct feature extraction methods Common Spatial Pattern (CSP), Fuzzy C-means clustering, and Tangent Space Mapping (TSM), are applied to each group of channels based on their brain region. Each method targets different characteristics of the EEG signal: CSP focuses on spatial patterns, Fuzzy C means identifies clusters within the data, and TSM captures non-linear patterns in the signal. The combined feature vector is used to classify motor imagery tasks (left hand, right hand, and right foot) using Support Vector Machine (SVM). The proposed method was validated on publicly available benchmark EEG datasets (IVA and I) from the BCI competition III and IV. The results show that the approach outperforms existing methods, achieving classification accuracies of 90.77% and 84.50% for datasets IVA and I, respectively.

Conclusion: 研究首次揭示了LLM驱动的自动驾驶模型在车辆交互场景中的对抗脆弱性，强调了未来基于大语言模型的智能交通系统需要面向鲁棒性进行设计。

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into automated driving systems has opened new possibilities for reasoning and decision-making by transforming complex driving contexts into language-understandable representations. Recent studies demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs can accurately predict vehicle trajectories and lane-change intentions by gathering and transforming data from surrounding vehicles. However, the robustness of such LLM-based prediction models for safety-critical driving systems remains unexplored, despite the increasing concerns about the trustworthiness of LLMs. This study addresses this gap by conducting a systematic vulnerability analysis of LLM-enabled vehicle trajectory prediction. We propose a one-feature differential evolution attack that perturbs a single kinematic feature of surrounding vehicles within the LLM's input prompts under a black-box setting. Experiments on the highD dataset reveal that even minor, physically plausible perturbations can significantly disrupt model outputs, underscoring the susceptibility of LLM-based predictors to adversarial manipulation. Further analyses reveal a trade-off between accuracy and robustness, examine the failure mechanism, and explore potential mitigation solutions. The findings provide the very first insights into adversarial vulnerabilities of LLM-driven automated vehicle models in the context of vehicular interactions and highlight the need for robustness-oriented design in future LLM-based intelligent transportation systems.

TL;DR: 提出RedReg方法解决多模态学习中模态偏差问题，通过自适应冗余调控平衡多模态信息优化，避免优势模态主导训练过程


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习中由于模态偏差，优势模态往往主导反向传播导致优化不平衡。现有方法存在两个问题：优势模态长期主导削弱表示-输出耦合，积累冗余信息；直接统一调整优势模态梯度忽略模态间语义和方向性

Result: 实验表明该方法在大多数场景下优于当前主流方法，消融实验验证了方法的有效性

Conclusion: RedReg方法能有效解决多模态学习中的模态偏差问题，通过自适应冗余调控实现平衡的多模态信息优化

Abstract: Multimodal learning aims to improve performance by leveraging data from multiple sources. During joint multimodal training, due to modality bias, the advantaged modality often dominates backpropagation, leading to imbalanced optimization. Existing methods still face two problems: First, the long-term dominance of the dominant modality weakens representation-output coupling in the late stages of training, resulting in the accumulation of redundant information. Second, previous methods often directly and uniformly adjust the gradients of the advantaged modality, ignoring the semantics and directionality between modalities. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Redundancy Regulation for Balanced Multimodal Information Refinement (RedReg), which is inspired by information bottleneck principle. Specifically, we construct a redundancy phase monitor that uses a joint criterion of effective gain growth rate and redundancy to trigger intervention only when redundancy is high. Furthermore, we design a co-information gating mechanism to estimate the contribution of the current dominant modality based on cross-modal semantics. When the task primarily relies on a single modality, the suppression term is automatically disabled to preserve modality-specific information. Finally, we project the gradient of the dominant modality onto the orthogonal complement of the joint multimodal gradient subspace and suppress the gradient according to redundancy. Experiments show that our method demonstrates superiority among current major methods in most scenarios. Ablation experiments verify the effectiveness of our method.

Motivation: 概率预测能够捕捉时间序列中的突变，而点预测容易完全错过这些变化。传统CDF建模局限于参数化方法，需要开发非参数方法来提升预测能力。

Method: 采用深度晶格网络（DLN）结合LSTM嵌入层，将分位数输入扩展到所有子晶格，利用DLN的单调约束能力防止分位数交叉，实现多时间范围的隐式CDF预测。

Result: 在太阳辐照度预测实验中，改进的DLN方法表现与无约束方法相当或更好，且优于可扩展单调神经网络。

Conclusion: 通过将单调神经网络与概率预测相结合，为这两个领域创造了更多的交叉研究机会，展示了DLN在概率预测中的有效应用。

Abstract: Probabilistic forecasting is not only a way to add more information to a prediction of the future, but it also builds on weaknesses in point prediction. Sudden changes in a time series can still be captured by a cumulative distribution function (CDF), while a point prediction is likely to miss it entirely. The modeling of CDFs within forecasts has historically been limited to parametric approaches, but due to recent advances, this no longer has to be the case. We aim to advance the fields of probabilistic forecasting and monotonic networks by connecting them and propose an approach that permits the forecasting of implicit, complete, and nonparametric CDFs. For this purpose, we propose an adaptation to deep lattice networks (DLN) for monotonically constrained simultaneous/implicit quantile regression in time series forecasting. Quantile regression usually produces quantile crossovers, which need to be prevented to achieve a legitimate CDF. By leveraging long short term memory units (LSTM) as the embedding layer, and spreading quantile inputs to all sub-lattices of a DLN with an extended output size, we can produce a multi-horizon forecast of an implicit CDF due to the monotonic constraintability of DLNs that prevent quantile crossovers. We compare and evaluate our approach's performance to relevant state of the art within the context of a highly relevant application of time series forecasting: Day-ahead, hourly forecasts of solar irradiance observations. Our experiments show that the adaptation of a DLN performs just as well or even better than an unconstrained approach. Further comparison of the adapted DLN against a scalable monotonic neural network shows that our approach performs better. With this adaptation of DLNs, we intend to create more interest and crossover investigations in techniques of monotonic neural networks and probabilistic forecasting.

This framework reflects the real-world complexities of clinical practice, minimizing reliance on extensive preprocessing and incorporating masked loss techniques for robust and unbiased model evaluation. By providing a standardized and unified platform for model development and comparison, VitalBench enables researchers to focus on architectural innovation while ensuring consistency in data handling.

Abstract: Deep learning-based molecular generation models have shown great potential in efficiently exploring vast chemical spaces by generating potential drug candidates with desired properties. However, these models often produce chemically invalid molecules, which limits the usable scope of the learned chemical space and poses significant challenges for practical applications. To address this issue, we propose ChemFixer, a framework designed to correct invalid molecules into valid ones. ChemFixer is built on a transformer architecture, pre-trained using masking techniques, and fine-tuned on a large-scale dataset of valid/invalid molecular pairs that we constructed. Through comprehensive evaluations across diverse generative models, ChemFixer improved molecular validity while effectively preserving the chemical and biological distributional properties of the original outputs. This indicates that ChemFixer can recover molecules that could not be previously generated, thereby expanding the diversity of potential drug candidates. Furthermore, ChemFixer was effectively applied to a drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction task using limited data, improving the validity of generated ligands and discovering promising ligand-protein pairs. These results suggest that ChemFixer is not only effective in data-limited scenarios, but also extensible to a wide range of downstream tasks. Taken together, ChemFixer shows promise as a practical tool for various stages of deep learning-based drug discovery, enhancing molecular validity and expanding accessible chemical space.

Conclusion: 所提出的自训练框架能有效利用无标注数据，在低资源环境下实现高质量的冒犯内容检测，为解决标注数据稀缺问题提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Accurate detection of offensive content on social media demands high-quality labeled data; however, such data is often scarce due to the low prevalence of offensive instances and the high cost of manual annotation. To address this low-resource challenge, we propose a self-training framework that leverages abundant unlabeled data through collaborative pseudo-labeling. Starting with a lightweight classifier trained on limited labeled data, our method iteratively assigns pseudo-labels to unlabeled instances with the support of Multi-Agent Vision-Language Models (MA-VLMs). Un-labeled data on which the classifier and MA-VLMs agree are designated as the Agreed-Unknown set, while conflicting samples form the Disagreed-Unknown set. To enhance label reliability, MA-VLMs simulate dual perspectives, moderator and user, capturing both regulatory and subjective viewpoints. The classifier is optimized using a novel Positive-Negative-Unlabeled (PNU) loss, which jointly exploits labeled, Agreed-Unknown, and Disagreed-Unknown data while mitigating pseudo-label noise. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework substantially outperforms baselines under limited supervision and approaches the performance of large-scale models

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界部署中常遇到混合分布偏移，现有TTA方法依赖统一的自适应路径，无法处理不同域间可能冲突的最优梯度方向问题。

Method: 提出MoETTA框架，采用混合专家架构，引入结构解耦的专家集合，支持沿不同梯度方向进行自适应，实现灵活解耦的参数更新。

Conclusion: 通过专家级多样性建模多个自适应方向具有显著优势，MoETTA能更好地适应异构偏移，在真实部署条件下表现出色。

Abstract: Test-Time adaptation (TTA) has proven effective in mitigating performance drops under single-domain distribution shifts by updating model parameters during inference. However, real-world deployments often involve mixed distribution shifts, where test samples are affected by diverse and potentially conflicting domain factors, posing significant challenges even for SOTA TTA methods. A key limitation in existing approaches is their reliance on a unified adaptation path, which fails to account for the fact that optimal gradient directions can vary significantly across different domains. Moreover, current benchmarks focus only on synthetic or homogeneous shifts, failing to capture the complexity of real-world heterogeneous mixed distribution shifts. To address this, we propose MoETTA, a novel entropy-based TTA framework that integrates the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. Rather than enforcing a single parameter update rule for all test samples, MoETTA introduces a set of structurally decoupled experts, enabling adaptation along diverse gradient directions. This design allows the model to better accommodate heterogeneous shifts through flexible and disentangled parameter updates. To simulate realistic deployment conditions, we introduce two new benchmarks: potpourri and potpourri+. While classical settings focus solely on synthetic corruptions, potpourri encompasses a broader range of domain shifts--including natural, artistic, and adversarial distortions--capturing more realistic deployment challenges. Additionally, potpourri+ further includes source-domain samples to evaluate robustness against catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments across three mixed distribution shifts settings show that MoETTA consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing SOTA performance and highlighting the benefit of modeling multiple adaptation directions via expert-level diversity.

Conclusion: 为单细胞转录组学中的基因增量学习提供了一个完整的基准，验证了基因增量学习中的遗忘问题，并展示了现有方法调整的有效性。

Abstract: Classes, as fundamental elements of Computer Vision, have been extensively studied within incremental learning frameworks. In contrast, tokens, which play essential roles in many research fields, exhibit similar characteristics of growth, yet investigations into their incremental learning remain significantly scarce. This research gap primarily stems from the holistic nature of tokens in language, which imposes significant challenges on the design of incremental learning frameworks for them. To overcome this obstacle, in this work, we turn to a type of token, gene, for a large-scale biological dataset--single-cell transcriptomics--to formulate a pipeline for gene incremental learning and establish corresponding evaluations. We found that the forgetting problem also exists in gene incremental learning, thus we adapted existing class incremental learning methods to mitigate the forgetting of genes. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrated the soundness of our framework design and evaluations, as well as the effectiveness of our method adaptations. Finally, we provide a complete benchmark for gene incremental learning in single-cell transcriptomics.

Abstract: The rapidly evolving landscape of AI and machine learning workloads has widened the gap between high-level domain operations and efficient hardware utilization. Achieving near-peak performance still demands deep hardware expertise-experts either handcraft target-specific kernels (e.g., DeepSeek) or rely on specialized libraries (e.g., CUTLASS)-both of which add complexity and limit scalability for most ML practitioners.
  This paper introduces a compilation scheme that automatically generates scalable, high-performance microkernels by leveraging the MLIR dialects to bridge domain-level operations and processor capabilities. Our approach removes dependence on low-level libraries by enabling the compiler to auto-generate near-optimal code directly. At its core is a mechanism for composing nanokernels from low-level IR constructs with near-optimal register utilization, forming efficient microkernels tailored to each target. We implement this technique in an MLIR-based compiler supporting both vector and tile based CPU instructions. Experiments show that the generated nanokernels are of production-quality, and competitive with state-of-the-art microkernel libraries.

Conclusion: PROF框架通过LLM生成奖励函数和自动化优化过程，在离线模仿学习中取得了显著性能提升，为奖励函数设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Offline imitation learning (offline IL) enables training effective policies without requiring explicit reward annotations. Recent approaches attempt to estimate rewards for unlabeled datasets using a small set of expert demonstrations. However, these methods often assume that the similarity between a trajectory and an expert demonstration is positively correlated with the reward, which oversimplifies the underlying reward structure. We propose PROF, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate and improve executable reward function codes from natural language descriptions and a single expert trajectory. We propose Reward Preference Ranking (RPR), a novel reward function quality assessment and ranking strategy without requiring environment interactions or RL training. RPR calculates the dominance scores of the reward functions, where higher scores indicate better alignment with expert preferences. By alternating between RPR and text-based gradient optimization, PROF fully automates the selection and refinement of optimal reward functions for downstream policy learning. Empirical results on D4RL demonstrate that PROF surpasses or matches recent strong baselines across numerous datasets and domains, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Deep ensembles (DE) have emerged as a powerful approach for quantifying predictive uncertainty and distinguishing its aleatoric and epistemic components, thereby enhancing model robustness and reliability. However, their high computational and memory costs during inference pose significant challenges for wide practical deployment. To overcome this issue, we propose credal ensemble distillation (CED), a novel framework that compresses a DE into a single model, CREDIT, for classification tasks. Instead of a single softmax probability distribution, CREDIT predicts class-wise probability intervals that define a credal set, a convex set of probability distributions, for uncertainty quantification. Empirical results on out-of-distribution detection benchmarks demonstrate that CED achieves superior or comparable uncertainty estimation compared to several existing baselines, while substantially reducing inference overhead compared to DE.

Result: 在视觉(CIFAR-100、Tiny-ImageNet)和NLP任务(GLUE等)上验证，持续优于静态温度基线

Conclusion: DTS方法能无缝集成现有KD框架，通过动态温度调度提升知识蒸馏效果

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) trains a smaller student model using a large, pre-trained teacher model, with temperature as a key hyperparameter controlling the softness of output probabilities. Traditional methods use a fixed temperature throughout training, which is suboptimal. Moreover, architectural differences between teacher and student often result in mismatched logit magnitudes. We demonstrate that students benefit from softer probabilities early in training but require sharper probabilities in later stages. We introduce Dynamic Temperature Scheduler (DTS), which adjusts temperature dynamically based on the cross-entropy loss gap between teacher and student. To our knowledge, this is the first temperature scheduling method that adapts based on the divergence between teacher and student distributions. Our method integrates seamlessly with existing KD frameworks. We validate DTS across multiple KD strategies on vision (CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet) and NLP tasks (GLUE, Dolly, SelfIns, UnNI, S-NI), consistently outperforming static-temperature baselines.

Conclusion: 线性编程语言为直接编程神经网络提供了路径，实现了学习与普通编程离散结构的丰富交互。

Abstract: We don't program neural networks directly. Instead, we rely on an indirect style where learning algorithms, like gradient descent, determine a neural network's function by learning from data. This indirect style is often a virtue; it empowers us to solve problems that were previously impossible. But it lacks discrete structure. We can't compile most algorithms into a neural network -- even if these algorithms could help the network learn. This limitation occurs because discrete algorithms are not obviously differentiable, making them incompatible with the gradient-based learning algorithms that determine a neural network's function. To address this, we introduce $\textsf{Cajal}$: a typed, higher-order and linear programming language intended to be a minimal vehicle for exploring a direct style of programming neural networks. We prove $\textsf{Cajal}$ programs compile to linear neurons, allowing discrete algorithms to be expressed in a differentiable form compatible with gradient-based learning. With our implementation of $\textsf{Cajal}$, we conduct several experiments where we link these linear neurons against other neural networks to determine part of their function prior to learning. Linking with these neurons allows networks to learn faster, with greater data-efficiency, and in a way that's easier to debug. A key lesson is that linear programming languages provide a path towards directly programming neural networks, enabling a rich interplay between learning and the discrete structures of ordinary programming.

Conclusion: Transformer架构的特定代数形式遵循这些投影原理，而非任意设计选择，为自注意力提供了坚实的数学理论基础。

Abstract: This paper presents a mathematical interpretation of self-attention by connecting it to distributional semantics principles. We show that self-attention emerges from projecting corpus-level co-occurrence statistics into sequence context. Starting from the co-occurrence matrix underlying GloVe embeddings, we demonstrate how the projection naturally captures contextual influence, with the query-key-value mechanism arising as the natural asymmetric extension for modeling directional relationships. Positional encodings and multi-head attention then follow as structured refinements of this same projection principle. Our analysis demonstrates that the Transformer architecture's particular algebraic form follows from these projection principles rather than being an arbitrary design choice.

TL;DR: 本文研究了自监督学习（SSL）的可迁移性，提出了任务冲突校准（TC²）方法，通过元学习范式构建多个SSL任务，使用因子提取网络和权重提取网络来缓解任务冲突，从而提升表示的可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索SSL表示的可迁移性，解决两个核心问题：(i) SSL表示的可迁移性是什么，(ii) 如何有效建模这种可迁移性。目标是提升从一项任务学到的表示支持另一项目标任务的能力。

Method: 提出任务冲突校准（TC²）方法：1）在训练批次中构建多个SSL任务以注入任务级信息；2）使用因子提取网络生成所有任务的因果生成因子；3）使用权重提取网络为每个样本分配专用权重；4）通过数据重构、正交性和稀疏性确保有效性；5）在SSL训练期间校准样本表示，并通过两阶段双级优化框架集成到流程中。

Result: 在多个下游任务上的实验结果表明，该方法能够持续提升SSL模型的可迁移性。

Conclusion: TC²方法通过缓解任务冲突有效提升了SSL表示的可迁移性，为自监督学习的表示学习提供了新的优化思路。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the transferability of SSL by addressing two central questions: (i) what is the representation transferability of SSL, and (ii) how can we effectively model this transferability? Transferability is defined as the ability of a representation learned from one task to support the objective of another.
  Inspired by the meta-learning paradigm, we construct multiple SSL tasks within each training batch to support explicitly modeling transferability. Based on empirical evidence and causal analysis, we find that although introducing task-level information improves transferability, it is still hindered by task conflict. To address this issue, we propose a Task Conflict Calibration (TC$^2$) method to alleviate the impact of task conflict. Specifically, it first splits batches to create multiple SSL tasks, infusing task-level information. Next, it uses a factor extraction network to produce causal generative factors for all tasks and a weight extraction network to assign dedicated weights to each sample, employing data reconstruction, orthogonality, and sparsity to ensure effectiveness. Finally, TC$^2$ calibrates sample representations during SSL training and integrates into the pipeline via a two-stage bi-level optimization framework to boost the transferability of learned representations. Experimental results on multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that our method consistently improves the transferability of SSL models.

*Samuel Nathanson,Rebecca Williams,Cynthia Matuszek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型能够系统性地越狱小型模型，模型大小比例与有害行为可能性呈正相关，攻击者行为多样性比目标易感性对对抗结果影响更大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在多代理和安全关键环境中应用增加，需要了解模型在对抗性交互中的脆弱性如何随规模变化，特别是大模型是否能系统性地绕过小模型的防护机制。

Method: 使用JailbreakBench标准化对抗任务，模拟6000多轮攻击者-目标交互，涵盖0.6B-120B参数的不同规模LLM，通过三个独立LLM法官评估伤害分数和拒绝行为。

Result: 攻击者与目标大小比例的对数与平均伤害分数呈强正相关（Pearson r=0.51），攻击者方行为差异比目标易感性对伤害结果影响更大，攻击者拒绝频率与伤害呈强负相关（rho=-0.93）。

Conclusion: 模型大小不对称影响鲁棒性，攻击者侧的对齐机制能有效减轻有害响应，需要更深入研究模型间对齐和安全性的缩放模式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly operate in multi-agent and safety-critical settings, raising open questions about how their vulnerabilities scale when models interact adversarially. This study examines whether larger models can systematically jailbreak smaller ones - eliciting harmful or restricted behavior despite alignment safeguards. Using standardized adversarial tasks from JailbreakBench, we simulate over 6,000 multi-turn attacker-target exchanges across major LLM families and scales (0.6B-120B parameters), measuring both harm score and refusal behavior as indicators of adversarial potency and alignment integrity. Each interaction is evaluated through aggregated harm and refusal scores assigned by three independent LLM judges, providing a consistent, model-based measure of adversarial outcomes. Aggregating results across prompts, we find a strong and statistically significant correlation between mean harm and the logarithm of the attacker-to-target size ratio (Pearson r = 0.51, p < 0.001; Spearman rho = 0.52, p < 0.001), indicating that relative model size correlates with the likelihood and severity of harmful completions. Mean harm score variance is higher across attackers (0.18) than across targets (0.10), suggesting that attacker-side behavioral diversity contributes more to adversarial outcomes than target susceptibility. Attacker refusal frequency is strongly and negatively correlated with harm (rho = -0.93, p < 0.001), showing that attacker-side alignment mitigates harmful responses. These findings reveal that size asymmetry influences robustness and provide exploratory evidence for adversarial scaling patterns, motivating more controlled investigations into inter-model alignment and safety.

TL;DR: 提出一种可微分的全局可解释性方法，通过将特征重要性估计直接集成到模型训练中，使用ScoresActivation函数在训练过程中进行特征排序，实现忠实、稳定的特征重要性评估，同时保持高预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的事后解释方法与模型训练过程脱节，限制了其忠实性和实用性，需要一种将可解释性直接融入模型训练的方法。

Method: 使用ScoresActivation函数作为特征排序机制，将其嵌入学习流程中，使模型能够以可微分和端到端可训练的方式根据特征对预测性能的贡献进行优先级排序。

Result: 在基准数据集上的评估显示，该方法产生与SHAP值和真实特征重要性一致的全局忠实、稳定的特征排名，同时保持高预测性能。特征评分速度比传统SHAP方法快150倍（训练仅需2秒vs SHAP的300秒），在包含相关和不相关特征的场景下分类准确率分别提高11.24%和29.33%。

Conclusion: 这项工作弥合了模型准确性和可解释性之间的差距，为固有可解释的机器学习提供了一个可扩展的框架。

Abstract: Understanding the decision of large deep learning models is a critical challenge for building transparent and trustworthy systems. Although the current post hoc explanation methods offer valuable insights into feature importance, they are inherently disconnected from the model training process, limiting their faithfulness and utility. In this work, we introduce a novel differentiable approach to global explainability by design, integrating feature importance estimation directly into model training. Central to our method is the ScoresActivation function, a feature-ranking mechanism embedded within the learning pipeline. This integration enables models to prioritize features according to their contribution to predictive performance in a differentiable and end-to-end trainable manner. Evaluations across benchmark datasets show that our approach yields globally faithful, stable feature rankings aligned with SHAP values and ground-truth feature importance, while maintaining high predictive performance. Moreover, feature scoring is 150 times faster than the classical SHAP method, requiring only 2 seconds during training compared to SHAP's 300 seconds for feature ranking in the same configuration. Our method also improves classification accuracy by 11.24% with 10 features (5 relevant) and 29.33% with 16 features (5 relevant, 11 irrelevant), demonstrating robustness to irrelevant inputs. This work bridges the gap between model accuracy and interpretability, offering a scalable framework for inherently explainable machine learning.

TL;DR: DAS是一个分布感知的推测解码框架，通过利用历史rollout数据构建自适应草稿器，加速强化学习后训练中的rollout阶段，可减少高达50%的rollout时间而不改变模型输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习后训练的效率受到rollout阶段的限制，特别是长尾分布中少数长生成轨迹占据了大部分计算时间，而历史rollout数据揭示了稳定的提示级别模式。

Method: DAS整合了两个关键思想：基于最近rollout构建的自适应非参数草稿器（使用增量维护的后缀树），以及长度感知的推测策略，为支配计算时间的长轨迹分配更激进的草稿预算。

Result: 在数学和代码推理任务上的实验表明，DAS减少了高达50%的rollout时间，同时保持了相同的训练曲线。

Conclusion: 分布感知的推测解码能够在不损害学习质量的情况下显著加速RL后训练。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning(RL) post-training has become essential for aligning large language models (LLMs), yet its efficiency is increasingly constrained by the rollout phase, where long trajectories are generated token by token. We identify a major bottleneck:the long-tail distribution of rollout lengths, where a small fraction of long generations dominates wall clock time and a complementary opportunity; the availability of historical rollouts that reveal stable prompt level patterns across training epochs. Motivated by these observations, we propose DAS, a Distribution Aware Speculative decoding framework that accelerates RL rollouts without altering model outputs. DAS integrates two key ideas: an adaptive, nonparametric drafter built from recent rollouts using an incrementally maintained suffix tree, and a length aware speculation policy that allocates more aggressive draft budgets to long trajectories that dominate makespan. This design exploits rollout history to sustain acceptance while balancing base and token level costs during decoding. Experiments on math and code reasoning tasks show that DAS reduces rollout time up to 50% while preserving identical training curves, demonstrating that distribution-aware speculative decoding can significantly accelerate RL post training without compromising learning quality.

Motivation: 传统CIL方法面临灾难性遗忘问题，而基于预训练模型的方法虽然高效但无法持续适应特征表示，导致性能次优。

Method: 提出AnaCP方法，结合分析分类器的效率和对比投影技术，实现无需梯度更新的增量特征适应。

Result: 实验表明AnaCP不仅超越现有基线方法，而且达到了联合训练的准确率水平，这是CIL的上限。

Conclusion: AnaCP成功解决了CIL中特征适应与灾难性遗忘的平衡问题，实现了接近理论上限的性能。

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of class-incremental learning (CIL), a core setting within continual learning where a model learns a sequence of tasks, each containing a distinct set of classes. Traditional CIL methods, which do not leverage pre-trained models (PTMs), suffer from catastrophic forgetting (CF) due to the need to incrementally learn both feature representations and the classifier. The integration of PTMs into CIL has recently led to efficient approaches that treat the PTM as a fixed feature extractor combined with analytic classifiers, achieving state-of-the-art performance. However, they still face a major limitation: the inability to continually adapt feature representations to best suit the CIL tasks, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose AnaCP (Analytic Contrastive Projection), a novel method that preserves the efficiency of analytic classifiers while enabling incremental feature adaptation without gradient-based training, thereby eliminating the CF caused by gradient updates. Our experiments show that AnaCP not only outperforms existing baselines but also achieves the accuracy level of joint training, which is regarded as the upper bound of CIL.

Motivation: 电力系统投资规划需要数十年的预测，面临深刻不确定性。传统方法生成有限数量的场景，限制了场景特定波动性的洞察，阻碍了稳健决策制定。

Method: 使用可处理概率模型（TPMs），特别是和积网络（SPNs），能够精确、可扩展地推断关键量，如场景似然、边际概率和条件概率，支持稳健的场景扩展和风险评估。

Result: 通过代表性电力系统规划案例研究，证明了该方法在计算和可靠性方面优于传统基于场景的模型。

Conclusion: TPMs框架能够将机会约束优化直接嵌入投资规划，以规定置信水平强制执行安全性或可靠性要求，同时支持场景分析和波动性量化。

Abstract: Investment planning in power utilities, such as generation and transmission expansion, requires decade-long forecasts under profound uncertainty. Forecasting of energy mix and energy use decades ahead is nontrivial. Classical approaches focus on generating a finite number of scenarios (modeled as a mixture of Diracs in statistical theory terms), which limits insight into scenario-specific volatility and hinders robust decision-making. We propose an alternative using tractable probabilistic models (TPMs), particularly sum-product networks (SPNs). These models enable exact, scalable inference of key quantities such as scenario likelihoods, marginals, and conditional probabilities, supporting robust scenario expansion and risk assessment.
  This framework enables direct embedding of chance-constrained optimization into investment planning, enforcing safety or reliability with prescribed confidence levels. TPMs allow both scenario analysis and volatility quantification by compactly representing high-dimensional uncertainties. We demonstrate the approach's effectiveness through a representative power system planning case study, illustrating computational and reliability advantages over traditional scenario-based models.

Motivation: 现有研究表明统计模型在差分隐私表格数据合成中优于神经网络方法，但这一结论忽略了密集相关数据集的挑战。神经网络能够拟合复杂分布，但现有神经网络方法仍有显著局限性。

Method: MargNet将统计模型的成功算法设计融入神经网络，采用自适应边缘选择策略，训练神经网络生成符合选定边缘分布的数据。

Result: 在稀疏相关数据集上，MargNet接近最佳统计方法的效用，同时平均速度提升7倍；在密集相关数据集上，MargNet建立了新的最先进水平，比之前最佳方法减少高达26%的保真度误差。

Conclusion: MargNet成功结合了统计模型和神经网络的优势，在稀疏和密集相关数据集上都表现出色，为差分隐私表格数据合成提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: In differentially private (DP) tabular data synthesis, the consensus is that statistical models are better than neural network (NN)-based methods. However, we argue that this conclusion is incomplete and overlooks the challenge of densely correlated datasets, where intricate dependencies can overwhelm statistical models. In such complex scenarios, neural networks are more suitable due to their capacity to fit complex distributions by learning directly from samples. Despite this potential, existing NN-based algorithms still suffer from significant limitations. We therefore propose MargNet, incorporating successful algorithmic designs of statistical models into neural networks. MargNet applies an adaptive marginal selection strategy and trains the neural networks to generate data that conforms to the selected marginals. On sparsely correlated datasets, our approach achieves utility close to the best statistical method while offering an average 7$\times$ speedup over it. More importantly, on densely correlated datasets, MargNet establishes a new state-of-the-art, reducing fidelity error by up to 26\% compared to the previous best. We release our code on GitHub.\footnote{https://github.com/KaiChen9909/margnet}

Abstract: Accurate renewable energy forecasting is essential to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and enabling grid decarbonization. However, current approaches fail to effectively integrate the rich spatial context of weather patterns with their temporal evolution. This work introduces a novel approach that treats weather maps as tokens in transformer sequences to predict renewable energy. Hourly weather maps are encoded as spatial tokens using a lightweight convolutional neural network, and then processed by a transformer to capture temporal dynamics across a 45-hour forecast horizon. Despite disadvantages in input initialization, evaluation against ENTSO-E operational forecasts shows a reduction in RMSE of about 60\% and 20\% for wind and solar respectively.

Conclusion: 复杂加权扩散为增强图神经网络表达能力提供了理论基础和实用机制，开辟了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse applications, yet they remain limited by oversmoothing and poor performance on heterophilic graphs. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework that equips graphs with a complex-weighted structure, assigning each edge a complex number to drive a diffusion process that extends random walks into the complex domain. We prove that this diffusion is highly expressive: with appropriately chosen complex weights, any node-classification task can be solved in the steady state of a complex random walk. Building on this insight, we propose the Complex-Weighted Convolutional Network (CWCN), which learns suitable complex-weighted structures directly from data while enriching diffusion with learnable matrices and nonlinear activations. CWCN is simple to implement, requires no additional hyperparameters beyond those of standard GNNs, and achieves competitive performance on benchmark datasets. Our results demonstrate that complex-weighted diffusion provides a principled and general mechanism for enhancing GNN expressiveness, opening new avenues for models that are both theoretically grounded and practically effective.

TL;DR: 研究表明，随机森林中调整bootstrap率(BR)能显著提升性能。最佳BR值因数据集特性而异：全局特征-目标关系强的数据集适合高BR，局部目标方差高的数据集适合低BR。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统随机森林默认使用BR=1.0，但缺乏对BR调优的系统研究。本文旨在系统探索不同BR值对RF性能的影响，并建立数据集特性与最优BR的关系。

Method: 在39个异质回归数据集和16种RF配置上，系统测试BR从0.2到5.0的变化，使用重复二折交叉验证和均方误差评估性能，并通过合成数据集实验验证发现。

Result: BR调优能显著改善性能：24个数据集最佳BR≤1.0，15个数据集最佳BR>1.0，仅4个数据集BR=1.0最优。数据集特性与BR偏好相关：全局关系强的偏好高BR，局部方差高的偏好低BR。

Conclusion: BR是影响RF回归模型性能的重要超参数，应根据数据集特性进行调优，在低噪声场景中高BR减少偏差，高噪声场景中低BR减少方差。

Abstract: Random Forests (RFs) typically train each tree on a bootstrap sample of the same size as the training set, i.e., bootstrap rate (BR) equals 1.0. We systematically examine how varying BR from 0.2 to 5.0 affects RF performance across 39 heterogeneous regression datasets and 16 RF configurations, evaluating with repeated two-fold cross-validation and mean squared error. Our results demonstrate that tuning the BR can yield significant improvements over the default: the best setup relied on BR \leq 1.0 for 24 datasets, BR > 1.0 for 15, and BR = 1.0 was optimal in 4 cases only. We establish a link between dataset characteristics and the preferred BR: datasets with strong global feature-target relationships favor higher BRs, while those with higher local target variance benefit from lower BRs. To further investigate this relationship, we conducted experiments on synthetic datasets with controlled noise levels. These experiments reproduce the observed bias-variance trade-off: in low-noise scenarios, higher BRs effectively reduce model bias, whereas in high-noise settings, lower BRs help reduce model variance. Overall, BR is an influential hyperparameter that should be tuned to optimize RF regression models.

Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the scalability of a recent Wasserstein-distance approach for training stochastic neural networks (SNNs) to reconstruct multidimensional random field models. We prove a generalization error bound for reconstructing multidimensional random field models on training stochastic neural networks with a limited number of training data. Our results indicate that when noise is heterogeneous across dimensions, the convergence rate of the generalization error may not depend explicitly on the model's dimensionality, partially alleviating the "curse of dimensionality" for learning multidimensional random field models from a finite number of data points. Additionally, we improve the previous Wasserstein-distance SNN training approach and showcase the robustness of the SNN. Through numerical experiments on different multidimensional uncertainty quantification tasks, we show that our Wasserstein-distance approach can successfully train stochastic neural networks to learn multidimensional uncertainty models.

Method: 对输入激活应用PCA Whitening预处理，通过理论和仿真分析展示其对优化景观的改善作用，并在SAEBench基准上评估ReLU和Top-K SAE。

Result: 白化处理一致提高了可解释性指标（稀疏探测精度和特征解缠），但重建质量略有下降。

Conclusion: 白化应作为SAE训练的默认预处理步骤，特别是当优先考虑可解释性而非完美重建时。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising approach for learning interpretable features from neural network activations. However, the optimization landscape for SAE training can be challenging due to correlations in the input data. We demonstrate that applying PCA Whitening to input activations -- a standard preprocessing technique in classical sparse coding -- improves SAE performance across multiple metrics. Through theoretical analysis and simulation, we show that whitening transforms the optimization landscape, making it more convex and easier to navigate. We evaluate both ReLU and Top-K SAEs across diverse model architectures, widths, and sparsity regimes. Empirical evaluation on SAEBench, a comprehensive benchmark for sparse autoencoders, reveals that whitening consistently improves interpretability metrics, including sparse probing accuracy and feature disentanglement, despite minor drops in reconstruction quality. Our results challenge the assumption that interpretability aligns with an optimal sparsity--fidelity trade-off and suggest that whitening should be considered as a default preprocessing step for SAE training, particularly when interpretability is prioritized over perfect reconstruction.

Abstract: We present a practical framework for detecting errors in LLM-generated SQL by estimating uncertainty at the level of individual nodes in the query's abstract syntax tree (AST). Our approach proceeds in two stages. First, we introduce a semantically aware labeling algorithm that, given a generated SQL and a gold reference, assigns node-level correctness without over-penalizing structural containers or alias variation. Second, we represent each node with a rich set of schema-aware and lexical features - capturing identifier validity, alias resolution, type compatibility, ambiguity in scope, and typo signals - and train a supervised classifier to predict per-node error probabilities. We interpret these probabilities as calibrated uncertainty, enabling fine-grained diagnostics that pinpoint exactly where a query is likely to be wrong. Across multiple databases and datasets, our method substantially outperforms token log-probabilities: average AUC improves by +27.44% while maintaining robustness under cross-database evaluation. Beyond serving as an accuracy signal, node-level uncertainty supports targeted repair, human-in-the-loop review, and downstream selective execution. Together, these results establish node-centric, semantically grounded uncertainty estimation as a strong and interpretable alternative to aggregate sequence level confidence measures.

Motivation: 研究差分隐私优化算法的计算效率，特别是理解隐私保护对优化算法运行时间的影响，以及梯度量化等技术的基本局限性。

Method: 通过理论分析建立差分隐私优化问题的下界，考虑不同设置：非光滑损失与私有代理oracle、光滑损失与私有优化器、以及信息受限oracle的情况。

Result: 证明了多个紧下界：非光滑情况下需要Ω(min{√d/α², d/log(1/α)})次查询；光滑情况下需要Ω̃(√d/α + min{1/α², n})次查询；信息受限oracle需要Ω(min{d/(α²Γ), d/log(1/α)})次查询。

Conclusion: 差分隐私优化器需要支付维度依赖的运行时间代价，梯度量化技术存在基本限制，这些结果为差分隐私优化的算法设计提供了理论指导。

Abstract: We study the running time, in terms of first order oracle queries, of differentially private empirical/population risk minimization of Lipschitz convex losses. We first consider the setting where the loss is non-smooth and the optimizer interacts with a private proxy oracle, which sends only private messages about a minibatch of gradients. In this setting, we show that expected running time $Ω(\min\{\frac{\sqrt{d}}{α^2}, \frac{d}{\log(1/α)}\})$ is necessary to achieve $α$ excess risk on problems of dimension $d$ when $d \geq 1/α^2$. Upper bounds via DP-SGD show these results are tight when $d>\tildeΩ(1/α^4)$. We further show our lower bound can be strengthened to $Ω(\min\{\frac{d}{\bar{m}α^2}, \frac{d}{\log(1/α)} \})$ for algorithms which use minibatches of size at most $\bar{m} < \sqrt{d}$. We next consider smooth losses, where we relax the private oracle assumption and give lower bounds under only the condition that the optimizer is private. Here, we lower bound the expected number of first order oracle calls by $\tildeΩ\big(\frac{\sqrt{d}}α + \min\{\frac{1}{α^2}, n\}\big)$, where $n$ is the size of the dataset. Modifications to existing algorithms show this bound is nearly tight. Compared to non-private lower bounds, our results show that differentially private optimizers pay a dimension dependent runtime penalty. Finally, as a natural extension of our proof technique, we show lower bounds in the non-smooth setting for optimizers interacting with information limited oracles. Specifically, if the proxy oracle transmits at most $Γ$-bits of information about the gradients in the minibatch, then $Ω\big(\min\{\frac{d}{α^2Γ}, \frac{d}{\log(1/α)}\}\big)$ oracle calls are needed. This result shows fundamental limitations of gradient quantization techniques in optimization.

Abstract: Bayesian networks (BNs) are a widely used class of probabilistic graphical models employed in numerous application domains. However, inferring the network's graphical structure from data remains challenging. Bayesian structure learners approach this problem by inferring a posterior distribution over the possible directed acyclic graphs underlying the BN. The inference process often requires marginalizing over probability distributions, which is typically done using dynamic programming methods that restrict the set of possible parents for each node. Instead, we present a novel method that utilizes tractable probabilistic circuits to circumvent this restriction. This method utilizes a new learning routine that trains these circuits on both the original distribution and marginal queries. The architecture of probabilistic circuits then inherently allows for fast and exact marginalization on the learned distribution. We then show empirically that utilizing our method to answer marginals allows Bayesian structure learners to improve their performance compared to current methods.

Abstract: Certified defenses promise provable robustness guarantees. We study the malicious exploitation of probabilistic certification frameworks to better understand the limits of guarantee provisions. Now, the objective is to not only mislead a classifier, but also manipulate the certification process to generate a robustness guarantee for an adversarial input certificate spoofing. A recent study in ICLR demonstrated that crafting large perturbations can shift inputs far into regions capable of generating a certificate for an incorrect class. Our study investigates if perturbations needed to cause a misclassification and yet coax a certified model into issuing a deceptive, large robustness radius for a target class can still be made small and imperceptible. We explore the idea of region-focused adversarial examples to craft imperceptible perturbations, spoof certificates and achieve certification radii larger than the source class ghost certificates. Extensive evaluations with the ImageNet demonstrate the ability to effectively bypass state-of-the-art certified defenses such as Densepure. Our work underscores the need to better understand the limits of robustness certification methods.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that fine-tuning on insecure code data can trigger an emergent misalignment (EMA) phenomenon, where models generate malicious responses even to prompts unrelated to the original insecure code-writing task. Such cross-domain generalization of harmful behavior underscores the need for a deeper understanding of the algorithms, tasks, and datasets that induce emergent misalignment. In this work, we extend this study by demonstrating that emergent misalignment can also arise from narrow refusal unlearning in specific domains. We perform refusal unlearning on Cybersecurity and Safety concept, and evaluate EMA by monitoring refusal scores across seven responsible AI (RAI) domains, Cybersecurity, Safety, Toxicity, Bias, Sensitive Content, Medical/Legal, and Privacy. Our work shows that narrow domain unlearning can yield compliance responses for the targeted concept, however, it may also propagate EMA to unrelated domains. Among the two intervened concepts, Cybersecurity and Safety, we find that the safety concept can have larger EMA impact, i.e, causing lower refusal scores, across other unrelated domains such as bias. We observe this effect consistently across two model families, Mistral-7b-0.3v, and Qwen-7b-2.5. Further, we show that refusal unlearning augmented with cross-entropy loss function on a small set of retain data from the affected domains can largely, if not fully, restore alignment across the impacted domains while having lower refusal rate on the concept we perform unlearning on. To investigate the underlying causes of EMA, we analyze concept entanglements at the representation level via concept vectors. Our analysis reveals that concepts with higher representation similarity in earlier layers are more susceptible to EMA after intervention when the refusal stream is altered through targeted refusal unlearning.

Motivation: 中小企业占美国企业的99.9%，但由于运营规模与现代机器学习的数据需求不匹配，它们被系统性地排除在AI应用之外。

Method: 采用三层架构：第一层从22,673条公共记录中提取信息先验；第二层在5-50个中小企业间实现分层池化；第三层提供具有有限样本覆盖保证的保形预测。

Result: 在客户流失数据验证中，每个企业仅用100个观测数据就达到96.7% ± 4.2%的AUC，比独立逻辑回归提高了24.2个百分点，训练时间仅33分钟。

Conclusion: SmallML通过使3300万家美国中小企业能够获得企业级预测能力，解决了AI民主化中的一个关键缺口。

Abstract: Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) represent 99.9% of U.S. businesses yet remain systematically excluded from AI due to a mismatch between their operational scale and modern machine learning's data requirements. This paper introduces SmallML, a Bayesian transfer learning framework achieving enterprise-level prediction accuracy with datasets as small as 50-200 observations.
  We develop a three-layer architecture integrating transfer learning, hierarchical Bayesian modeling, and conformal prediction. Layer 1 extracts informative priors from 22,673 public records using a SHAP-based procedure transferring knowledge from gradient boosting to logistic regression. Layer 2 implements hierarchical pooling across J=5-50 SMEs with adaptive shrinkage, balancing population patterns with entity-specific characteristics. Layer 3 provides conformal sets with finite-sample coverage guarantees P(y in C(x)) >= 1-alpha for distribution-free uncertainty quantification.
  Validation on customer churn data demonstrates 96.7% +/- 4.2% AUC with 100 observations per business -- a +24.2 point improvement over independent logistic regression (72.5% +/- 8.1%), with p < 0.000001. Conformal prediction achieves 92% empirical coverage at 90% target. Training completes in 33 minutes on standard CPU hardware. By enabling enterprise-grade predictions for 33 million U.S. SMEs previously excluded from machine learning, SmallML addresses a critical gap in AI democratization.

*Marios Papamichals,Regina Ruane*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Radial Compensation (RC)方法，通过选择切空间中的基础密度，使似然仅依赖于到极点的测地距离，从而将参数语义与曲率解耦。该方法在保持测地半径清晰含义的同时，可将图表作为数值预处理器进行调优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在弯曲空间上的生成模型存在两个问题：指数映射保持测地线但具有刚性的半径依赖雅可比矩阵，而体积保持图表保持密度但扭曲测地距离。这两种方法都将曲率与模型参数纠缠在一起，导致梯度方差膨胀。

Method: 引入Radial Compensation (RC)方法，在切空间中选择基础密度，使似然仅依赖于测地距离。扩展RC到已知测地极体积的流形，推导Balanced-Exponential (bExp)图表族，平衡体积扭曲和测地误差。

Result: RC在所有bExp设置下保持相同的流形密度和Fisher信息，较小的拨号值减少梯度方差和流成本。实验表明RC在密度、VAE、图像和图上的流以及蛋白质模型中产生稳定的生成模型。

Conclusion: RC提高了似然度，恢复了清晰的测地半径，并防止了高维流中的半径爆炸，使RC-bExp成为流形上似然训练生成模型的稳健默认选择。

Abstract: Generative models on curved spaces rely on charts to map Euclidean spaces to manifolds. Exponential maps preserve geodesics but have stiff, radius-dependent Jacobians, while volume-preserving charts maintain densities but distort geodesic distances. Both approaches entangle curvature with model parameters, inflating gradient variance. In high-dimensional latent normalizing flows, the wrapped exponential prior can stretch radii far beyond the curvature scale, leading to poor test likelihoods and stiff solvers. We introduce Radial Compensation (RC), an information-geometric method that selects the base density in the tangent space so that the likelihood depends only on geodesic distance from a pole, decoupling parameter semantics from curvature. RC lets radial parameters retain their usual meaning in geodesic units, while the chart can be tuned as a numerical preconditioner. We extend RC to manifolds with known geodesic polar volume and show that RC is the only construction for geodesic-radial likelihoods with curvature-invariant Fisher information. We derive the Balanced-Exponential (bExp) chart family, balancing volume distortion and geodesic error. Under RC, all bExp settings preserve the same manifold density and Fisher information, with smaller dial values reducing gradient variance and flow cost. Empirically, RC yields stable generative models across densities, VAEs, flows on images and graphs, and protein models. RC improves likelihoods, restores clean geodesic radii, and prevents radius blow-ups in high-dimensional flows, making RC-bExp a robust default for likelihood-trained generative models on manifolds.

Abstract: In precision sports such as archery, athletes' performance depends on both biomechanical stability and psychological resilience. Traditional motion analysis systems are often expensive and intrusive, limiting their use in natural training environments. To address this limitation, we propose a machine learning-based multimodal framework that integrates wearable sensor data for simultaneous action recognition and stress estimation. Using a self-developed wrist-worn device equipped with an accelerometer and photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor, we collected synchronized motion and physiological data during real archery sessions. For motion recognition, we introduce a novel feature--Smoothed Differential Acceleration (SmoothDiff)--and employ a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to identify motion phases, achieving 96.8% accuracy and 95.9% F1-score. For stress estimation, we extract heart rate variability (HRV) features from PPG signals and apply a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier, achieving 80% accuracy in distinguishing high- and low-stress levels. The proposed framework demonstrates that integrating motion and physiological sensing can provide meaningful insights into athletes' technical and mental states. This approach offers a foundation for developing intelligent, real-time feedback systems for training optimization in archery and other precision sports.

Motivation: 现有药物推荐系统存在两个基本限制：(i)将医疗实体视为独立特征，未建模它们对药物选择的协同效应；(ii)使用静态因果关系，无法适应患者特定情境和健康状态。

Method: 提出CafeMed框架，包含两个关键组件：Causal Weight Generator将静态因果效应转换为基于患者状态的动态调制权重；Channel Harmonized Attention Refinement Module捕捉诊断和程序之间的复杂相互依赖关系。

Result: 在MIMIC-III和MIMIC-IV数据集上的广泛实验表明，CafeMed显著优于现有最先进基线，在药物预测准确性方面表现优异，同时保持较低的药物-药物相互作用率。

Conclusion: 整合动态因果关系和跨模态协同效应能够产生更符合临床实践和个性化的药物推荐，CafeMed框架为安全准确的药物推荐提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Medication recommendation systems play a crucial role in assisting clinicians with personalized treatment decisions. While existing approaches have made significant progress in learning medication representations, they suffer from two fundamental limitations: (i) treating medical entities as independent features without modeling their synergistic effects on medication selection; (ii) employing static causal relationships that fail to adapt to patient-specific contexts and health states. To address these challenges, we propose CafeMed, a framework that integrates dynamic causal reasoning with cross-modal attention for safe and accurate medication recommendation. CafeMed introduces two key components: the Causal Weight Generator (CWG) that transforms static causal effects into dynamic modulation weights based on individual patient states, and the Channel Harmonized Attention Refinement Module (CHARM) that captures complex interdependencies between diagnoses and procedures. This design enables CafeMed to model how different medical conditions jointly influence treatment decisions while maintaining medication safety constraints. Extensive experiments on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets demonstrate that CafeMed significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving superior accuracy in medication prediction while maintaining the lower drug--drug interaction rates. Our results indicate that incorporating dynamic causal relationships and cross-modal synergies leads to more clinically-aligned and personalized medication recommendations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CFG在训练时交替使用条件提示和无条件提示，但在采样时同时输出两者，导致训练与采样过程中的噪声估计不一致。

Method: CFG-EC通过将无条件噪声误差分量与条件误差分量正交化，防止两个引导分量相互干扰，从而约束采样误差的上界。

Result: 数值实验表明CFG-EC在低引导采样机制下表现显著优于CFG和CFG++，并在所有情况下都实现了更高的提示对齐度。

Conclusion: CFG-EC是一种可增强任何基于CFG方法的通用校正方案，能够提供更可靠的引导轨迹以实现高保真图像生成。

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has become a mainstream approach for simultaneously improving prompt fidelity and generation quality in conditional generative models. During training, CFG stochastically alternates between conditional and null prompts to enable both conditional and unconditional generation. However, during sampling, CFG outputs both null and conditional prompts simultaneously, leading to inconsistent noise estimates between the training and sampling processes. To reduce this error, we propose CFG-EC, a versatile correction scheme augmentable to any CFG-based method by refining the unconditional noise predictions. CFG-EC actively realigns the unconditional noise error component to be orthogonal to the conditional error component. This corrective maneuver prevents interference between the two guidance components, thereby constraining the sampling error's upper bound and establishing more reliable guidance trajectories for high-fidelity image generation. Our numerical experiments show that CFG-EC handles the unconditional component more effectively than CFG and CFG++, delivering a marked performance increase in the low guidance sampling regime and consistently higher prompt alignment across the board.

Conclusion: Meta-SimGNN通过图神经网络和元学习的结合，有效解决了设备配置变化带来的挑战，提升了WiFi定位系统的实用性和适应性。

Abstract: To promote the practicality of deep learning-based localization, existing studies aim to address the issue of scenario dependence through meta-learning. However, these studies primarily focus on variations in environmental layouts while overlooking the impact of changes in device configurations, such as bandwidth, the number of access points (APs), and the number of antennas used. Unlike environmental changes, variations in device configurations affect the dimensionality of channel state information (CSI), thereby compromising neural network usability. To address this issue, we propose Meta-SimGNN, a novel WiFi localization system that integrates graph neural networks with meta-learning to improve localization generalization and robustness. First, we introduce a fine-grained CSI graph construction scheme, where each AP is treated as a graph node, allowing for adaptability to changes in the number of APs. To structure the features of each node, we propose an amplitude-phase fusion method and a feature extraction method. The former utilizes both amplitude and phase to construct CSI images, enhancing data reliability, while the latter extracts dimension-consistent features to address variations in bandwidth and the number of antennas. Second, a similarity-guided meta-learning strategy is developed to enhance adaptability in diverse scenarios. The initial model parameters for the fine-tuning stage are determined by comparing the similarity between the new scenario and historical scenarios, facilitating rapid adaptation of the model to the new localization scenario. Extensive experimental results over commodity WiFi devices in different scenarios show that Meta-SimGNN outperforms the baseline methods in terms of localization generalization and accuracy.

Motivation: 现有差分隐私审计方法需要修改训练数据集（如注入异常数据或移除样本），这在大型系统中资源密集且工程开销大，需要一种无需干预数据管道的审计方法。

Result: 在Criteo和CIFAR-10数据集上的实验证明该方法能有效审计标签隐私保证。

Conclusion: 这项工作为大规模生产环境中的实用隐私审计开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) auditing is essential for evaluating privacy guarantees in machine learning systems. Existing auditing methods, however, pose a significant challenge for large-scale systems since they require modifying the training dataset -- for instance, by injecting out-of-distribution canaries or removing samples from training. Such interventions on the training data pipeline are resource-intensive and involve considerable engineering overhead. We introduce a novel observational auditing framework that leverages the inherent randomness of data distributions, enabling privacy evaluation without altering the original dataset. Our approach extends privacy auditing beyond traditional membership inference to protected attributes, with labels as a special case, addressing a key gap in existing techniques. We provide theoretical foundations for our method and perform experiments on Criteo and CIFAR-10 datasets that demonstrate its effectiveness in auditing label privacy guarantees. This work opens new avenues for practical privacy auditing in large-scale production environments.

Conclusion: 为资源受限环境中管理数据依赖性内存访问建立了一种新的原则性方法，使MoE推理在商用硬件上更加可行。

Abstract: The immense memory requirements of state-of-the-art Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models present a significant challenge for inference, often exceeding the capacity of a single accelerator. While offloading experts to host memory is a common solution, it introduces a severe I/O bottleneck over the PCIe bus, as the data-dependent nature of expert selection places these synchronous transfers directly on the critical path of execution, crippling performance.
  This paper argues that the I/O bottleneck can be overcome by trading a small amount of cheap, on-device computation to hide the immense cost of data movement. We present MoE-SpeQ, a new inference system built on a novel co-design of speculative execution and expert offloading. MoE-SpeQ employs a small, on-device draft model to predict the sequence of required experts for future tokens. This foresight enables a runtime orchestrator to prefetch these experts from host memory, effectively overlapping the expensive I/O with useful computation and hiding the latency from the critical path. To maximize performance, an adaptive governor, guided by an Amortization Roofline Model, dynamically tunes the speculation strategy to the underlying hardware. Our evaluation on memory-constrained devices shows that for the Phi-MoE model, MoE-SpeQ achieves at most 2.34x speedup over the state-of-the-art offloading framework. Our work establishes a new, principled approach for managing data-dependent memory access in resource-limited environments, making MoE inference more accessible on commodity hardware.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准方法将多样的人类标注聚合为单一标签，这导致模型在本质上模糊的数据上表达虚假的置信度，与人类感知的多样性不匹配。

Method: 采用软标签训练方法，将标注分布本身视为真实标签，而不是将其压缩为单一标签。

Result: 在视觉和NLP任务中，软标签训练相比硬标签训练实现了32%更低的KL散度和61%更强的模型与标注熵相关性，同时保持相同的准确率。

Conclusion: 标注分布不应被视为需要聚合的噪声信号，而应作为认知不确定性的忠实表示，模型应该学习重现这种不确定性。

Abstract: Many machine learning tasks involve inherent subjectivity, where annotators naturally provide varied labels. Standard practice collapses these label distributions into single labels, aggregating diverse human judgments into point estimates. We argue that this approach is epistemically misaligned for ambiguous data--the annotation distribution itself should be regarded as the ground truth. Training on collapsed single labels forces models to express false confidence on fundamentally ambiguous cases, creating a misalignment between model certainty and the diversity of human perception. We demonstrate empirically that soft-label training, which treats annotation distributions as ground truth, preserves epistemic uncertainty. Across both vision and NLP tasks, soft-label training achieves 32% lower KL divergence from human annotations and 61% stronger correlation between model and annotation entropy, while matching the accuracy of hard-label training. Our work repositions annotation distributions from noisy signals to be aggregated away, to faithful representations of epistemic uncertainty that models should learn to reproduce.

Conclusion: SSC提供了一个通用且可解释的工具，用于使用观察性数据进行反事实生存推断，在医学、经济学和公共政策中具有广泛应用价值。

Abstract: Estimating causal effects on time-to-event outcomes from observational data is particularly challenging due to censoring, limited sample sizes, and non-random treatment assignment. The need for answering such "when-if" questions--how the timing of an event would change under a specified intervention--commonly arises in real-world settings with heterogeneous treatment adoption and confounding. To address these challenges, we propose Synthetic Survival Control (SSC) to estimate counterfactual hazard trajectories in a panel data setting where multiple units experience potentially different treatments over multiple periods. In such a setting, SSC estimates the counterfactual hazard trajectory for a unit of interest as a weighted combination of the observed trajectories from other units. To provide formal justification, we introduce a panel framework with a low-rank structure for causal survival analysis. Indeed, such a structure naturally arises under classical parametric survival models. Within this framework, for the causal estimand of interest, we establish identification and finite sample guarantees for SSC. We validate our approach using a multi-country clinical dataset of cancer treatment outcomes, where the staggered introduction of new therapies creates a quasi-experimental setting. Empirically, we find that access to novel treatments is associated with improved survival, as reflected by lower post-intervention hazard trajectories relative to their synthetic counterparts. Given the broad relevance of survival analysis across medicine, economics, and public policy, our framework offers a general and interpretable tool for counterfactual survival inference using observational data.

Abstract: Enforcing a fair workload allocation among multiple agents tasked to achieve an objective in learning enabled demand side healthcare worker settings is crucial for consistent and reliable performance at runtime. Existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches steer fairness by shaping reward through post hoc orchestrations, leaving no certifiable self-enforceable fairness that is immutable by individual agents at runtime. Contextualized within a setting where each agent shares resources with others, we address this shortcoming with a learning enabled optimization scheme among self-interested decision makers whose individual actions affect those of other agents. This extends the problem to a generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) game-theoretic framework where we steer group policy to a safe and locally efficient equilibrium, so that no agent can improve its utility function by unilaterally changing its decisions. Fair-GNE models MARL as a constrained generalized Nash equilibrium-seeking (GNE) game, prescribing an ideal equitable collective equilibrium within the problem's natural fabric. Our hypothesis is rigorously evaluated in our custom-designed high-fidelity resuscitation simulator. Across all our numerical experiments, Fair-GNE achieves significant improvement in workload balance over fixed-penalty baselines (0.89 vs.\ 0.33 JFI, $p < 0.01$) while maintaining 86\% task success, demonstrating statistically significant fairness gains through adaptive constraint enforcement. Our results communicate our formulations, evaluation metrics, and equilibrium-seeking innovations in large multi-agent learning-based healthcare systems with clarity and principled fairness enforcement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs从训练数据中继承了显性和隐性偏见，可能传播有害刻板印象和错误信息，需要识别和缓解这些偏见以确保公平输出。

Conclusion: 尽管LLMs在偏见检测方面取得了一定成功，但仍存在过度依赖关键词的问题。通过微调和数据增强可以显著提升模型在隐性偏见检测方面的性能，展示了改进LLMs偏见识别能力的可行性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) inherit explicit and implicit biases from their training datasets. Identifying and mitigating biases in LLMs is crucial to ensure fair outputs, as they can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and misinformation. This study highlights the need to address biases in LLMs amid growing generative AI. We studied bias-specific benchmarks such as StereoSet and CrowSPairs to evaluate the existence of various biases in multiple generative models such as BERT and GPT 3.5. We proposed an automated Bias-Identification Framework to recognize various social biases in LLMs such as gender, race, profession, and religion. We adopted a two-pronged approach to detect explicit and implicit biases in text data. Results indicated fine-tuned models struggle with gender biases but excelled at identifying and avoiding racial biases. Our findings illustrated that despite having some success, LLMs often over-relied on keywords. To illuminate the capability of the analyzed LLMs in detecting implicit biases, we employed Bag-of-Words analysis and unveiled indications of implicit stereotyping within the vocabulary. To bolster the model performance, we applied an enhancement strategy involving fine-tuning models using prompting techniques and data augmentation of the bias benchmarks. The fine-tuned models exhibited promising adaptability during cross-dataset testing and significantly enhanced performance on implicit bias benchmarks, with performance gains of up to 20%.

Conclusion: CSGU为符号图神经网络提供了可证明的隐私保证，同时保持了社会学原则，实现了隐私保护和模型效用的平衡。

Abstract: Signed graphs model complex relationships through positive and negative edges, with widespread real-world applications. Given the sensitive nature of such data, selective removal mechanisms have become essential for privacy protection. While graph unlearning enables the removal of specific data influences from Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), existing methods are designed for conventional GNNs and overlook the unique heterogeneous properties of signed graphs. When applied to Signed Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs), these methods lose critical sign information, degrading both model utility and unlearning effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose Certified Signed Graph Unlearning (CSGU), which provides provable privacy guarantees while preserving the sociological principles underlying SGNNs. CSGU employs a three-stage method: (1) efficiently identifying minimal influenced neighborhoods via triangular structures, (2) applying sociological theories to quantify node importance for optimal privacy budget allocation, and (3) performing importance-weighted parameter updates to achieve certified modifications with minimal utility degradation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CSGU outperforms existing methods, achieving superior performance in both utility preservation and unlearning effectiveness on SGNNs.

Motivation: 主流红队测试方法依赖在线生成和黑盒输出分析，成本高昂且存在反馈延迟，不适合新模型训练后的敏捷诊断。

Method: 提出N-GLARE方法，完全基于模型的潜在表征操作，分析潜在表征的APT轨迹，引入JSS度量来表征隐藏层动态。

Result: 在超过40个模型和20种红队策略上的实验表明，JSS指标与红队测试得出的安全排名具有高度一致性。

Conclusion: N-GLARE为实时诊断提供了一种高效的无输出评估代理，显著降低了评估成本。

Abstract: Evaluating the safety robustness of LLMs is critical for their deployment. However, mainstream Red Teaming methods rely on online generation and black-box output analysis. These approaches are not only costly but also suffer from feedback latency, making them unsuitable for agile diagnostics after training a new model. To address this, we propose N-GLARE (A Non-Generative, Latent Representation-Efficient LLM Safety Evaluator). N-GLARE operates entirely on the model's latent representations, bypassing the need for full text generation. It characterizes hidden layer dynamics by analyzing the APT (Angular-Probabilistic Trajectory) of latent representations and introducing the JSS (Jensen-Shannon Separability) metric. Experiments on over 40 models and 20 red teaming strategies demonstrate that the JSS metric exhibits high consistency with the safety rankings derived from Red Teaming. N-GLARE reproduces the discriminative trends of large-scale red-teaming tests at less than 1\% of the token cost and the runtime cost, providing an efficient output-free evaluation proxy for real-time diagnostics.

Abstract: Weather forecasting is fundamentally challenged by the chaotic nature of the atmosphere, necessitating probabilistic approaches to quantify uncertainty. While traditional ensemble prediction (EPS) addresses this through computationally intensive simulations, recent advances in Bayesian Deep Learning (BDL) offer a promising but often disconnected alternative. We bridge these paradigms through a unified hybrid Bayesian Deep Learning framework for ensemble weather forecasting that explicitly decomposes predictive uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components, learned via variational inference and a physics-informed stochastic perturbation scheme modeling flow-dependent atmospheric dynamics, respectively. We further establish a unified theoretical framework that rigorously connects BDL and EPS, providing formal theorems that decompose total predictive uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components under the hybrid BDL framework. We validate our framework on the large-scale 40-year ERA5 reanalysis dataset (1979-2019) with 0.25° spatial resolution. Experimental results show that our method not only improves forecast accuracy and yields better-calibrated uncertainty quantification but also achieves superior computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art probabilistic diffusion models. We commit to making our code open-source upon acceptance of this paper.

Motivation: 基于模型的强化学习方法中，SMC作为MCTS的替代方案虽然更易于并行化和GPU加速，但存在方差大和路径退化问题，限制了其在深度搜索中的扩展能力。

Method: 提出了Twice Sequential Monte Carlo Tree Search (TSMCTS)方法，通过双重序列蒙特卡洛树搜索来减少方差并缓解路径退化问题。

Result: 在离散和连续环境中，TSMCTS优于SMC基线和现代MCTS版本，能够更好地扩展序列计算能力。

Conclusion: TSMCTS通过解决SMC的方差和路径退化问题，在保持并行化优势的同时实现了更好的搜索深度扩展性能。

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) methods that leverage search are responsible for many milestone breakthroughs in RL. Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) recently emerged as an alternative to the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm which drove these breakthroughs. SMC is easier to parallelize and more suitable to GPU acceleration. However, it also suffers from large variance and path degeneracy which prevent it from scaling well with increased search depth, i.e., increased sequential compute. To address these problems, we introduce Twice Sequential Monte Carlo Tree Search (TSMCTS). Across discrete and continuous environments TSMCTS outperforms the SMC baseline as well as a popular modern version of MCTS. Through variance reduction and mitigation of path degeneracy, TSMCTS scales favorably with sequential compute while retaining the properties that make SMC natural to parallelize.

Abstract: We simplify space binding by focusing on two core components, a single encoder per modality and high-quality data; enabling training state-of-the-art models on a single GPU in a few hours as opposed to multiple days. We present EBind, an Easy, data-centric, and parameter-efficient method to Bind the embedding spaces of multiple contrastive models. We demonstrate that a simple 1.8B-parameter image-text-video-audio-3D model can outperform models 4 to 17x the size. The key to achieving this is a carefully curated dataset of three complementary data sources: i) 6.7M fully-automated multimodal quintuples sourced via SOTA retrieval models, ii) 1M diverse, semi-automated triples annotated by humans as negative, partial, or positive matches, and iii) 3.4M pre-existing captioned data items. We use 13 different evaluations to demonstrate the value of each data source. Due to limitations with existing benchmarks, we further introduce the first high-quality, consensus-annotated zero-shot classification benchmark between audio and PCs. In contrast to related work, we will open-source our code, model weights, and datasets.

Motivation: 现有世界模型难以准确模拟高维、非平稳且包含多对象丰富交互的环境，而人类通过将环境分解为离散对象来感知，这启发了面向对象表示的研究。

Method: 使用面向对象的Transformer表示每个观测为对象中心token集合，包含动作和奖励token，预测token级动态和交互；策略和价值网络估计token级因果关系并在注意力层中使用。

Result: 在对象丰富的基准测试中，STICA在样本效率和最终性能上都持续优于最先进的智能体。

Conclusion: 面向对象的世界模型结合因果感知决策能够有效提升强化学习在复杂环境中的性能。

Abstract: World models have been developed to support sample-efficient deep reinforcement learning agents. However, it remains challenging for world models to accurately replicate environments that are high-dimensional, non-stationary, and composed of multiple objects with rich interactions since most world models learn holistic representations of all environmental components. By contrast, humans perceive the environment by decomposing it into discrete objects, facilitating efficient decision-making. Motivated by this insight, we propose \emph{Slot Transformer Imagination with CAusality-aware reinforcement learning} (STICA), a unified framework in which object-centric Transformers serve as the world model and causality-aware policy and value networks. STICA represents each observation as a set of object-centric tokens, together with tokens for the agent action and the resulting reward, enabling the world model to predict token-level dynamics and interactions. The policy and value networks then estimate token-level cause--effect relations and use them in the attention layers, yielding causality-guided decision-making. Experiments on object-rich benchmarks demonstrate that STICA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art agents in both sample efficiency and final performance.

Abstract: Recent work in deep learning has opened new possibilities for solving classical algorithmic tasks using end-to-end learned models. In this work, we investigate the fundamental task of solving linear systems, particularly those that are ill-conditioned. Existing numerical methods for ill-conditioned systems often require careful parameter tuning, preconditioning, or domain-specific expertise to ensure accuracy and stability. In this work, we propose Algebraformer, a Transformer-based architecture that learns to solve linear systems end-to-end, even in the presence of severe ill-conditioning. Our model leverages a novel encoding scheme that enables efficient representation of matrix and vector inputs, with a memory complexity of $O(n^2)$, supporting scalable inference. We demonstrate its effectiveness on application-driven linear problems, including interpolation tasks from spectral methods for boundary value problems and acceleration of the Newton method. Algebraformer achieves competitive accuracy with significantly lower computational overhead at test time, demonstrating that general-purpose neural architectures can effectively reduce complexity in traditional scientific computing pipelines.

Abstract: Vessel trajectory prediction is fundamental to intelligent maritime systems. Within this domain, short-term prediction of rapid behavioral changes in complex maritime environments has established multimodal trajectory prediction (MTP) as a promising research area. However, existing vessel MTP methods suffer from limited scenario applicability and insufficient explainability. To address these challenges, we propose a unified MTP framework incorporating explainable navigation intentions, which we classify into sustained and transient categories. Our method constructs sustained intention trees from historical trajectories and models dynamic transient intentions using a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), while using a non-local attention mechanism to maintain global scenario consistency. Experiments on real Automatic Identification System (AIS) datasets demonstrates our method's broad applicability across diverse scenarios, achieving significant improvements in both ADE and FDE. Furthermore, our method improves explainability by explicitly revealing the navigational intentions underlying each predicted trajectory.

Abstract: Deep neural networks achieve outstanding performance in visual recognition tasks, yet their large number of parameters makes them less practical for real-world applications. Recently, one-shot pruning has emerged as an effective strategy for reducing model size without additional training. However, models trained with standard objective functions often suffer a significant drop in accuracy after aggressive pruning. Some existing pruning-robust optimizers, such as SAM, and CrAM, mitigate this accuracy drop by guiding the model toward flatter regions of the parameter space, but they inevitably incur non-negligible additional computations. We propose a Variance Amplifying Regularizer (VAR) that deliberately increases the variance of model parameters during training. Our study reveals an intriguing finding that parameters with higher variance exhibit greater pruning robustness. VAR exploits this property by promoting such variance in the weight distribution, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of pruning. We further provide a theoretical analysis of its convergence behavior, supported by extensive empirical results demonstrating the superior pruning robustness of VAR.

Result: 在合成和真实医疗数据集上的实验表明，使用这些工具可以选择出泛化能力更强且符合容量约束的模型。

Conclusion: IE和PVF为解决临床环境中的Rashomon效应提供了新方向，能够选择出更稳健且符合临床需求的模型。

Abstract: In clinical machine learning, the coexistence of multiple models with comparable performance -- a manifestation of the Rashomon Effect -- poses fundamental challenges for trustworthy deployment and evaluation. Small, imbalanced, and noisy datasets, coupled with high-dimensional and weakly identified clinical features, amplify this multiplicity and make conventional validation schemes unreliable. As a result, selecting among equally performing models becomes uncertain, particularly when resource constraints and operational priorities are not considered by conventional metrics like F1 score. To address these issues, we propose two complementary tools for robust model assessment and selection: Intervention Efficiency (IE) and the Perturbation Validation Framework (PVF). IE is a capacity-aware metric that quantifies how efficiently a model identifies actionable true positives when only limited interventions are feasible, thereby linking predictive performance with clinical utility. PVF introduces a structured approach to assess the stability of models under data perturbations, identifying models whose performance remains most invariant across noisy or shifted validation sets. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world healthcare datasets show that using these tools facilitates the selection of models that generalize more robustly and align with capacity constraints, offering a new direction for tackling the Rashomon Effect in clinical settings.

Conclusion: 等式约束为机器学习问题提供了新的建模能力，所提出的理论和算法为处理包含等式约束的学习问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: As machine learning applications grow increasingly ubiquitous and complex, they face an increasing set of requirements beyond accuracy. The prevalent approach to handle this challenge is to aggregate a weighted combination of requirement violation penalties into the training objective. To be effective, this approach requires careful tuning of these hyperparameters (weights), involving trial-and-error and cross-validation, which becomes ineffective even for a moderate number of requirements. These issues are exacerbated when the requirements involve parities or equalities, as is the case in fairness and boundary value problems. An alternative technique uses constrained optimization to formulate these learning problems. Yet, existing approximation and generalization guarantees do not apply to problems involving equality constraints. In this work, we derive a generalization theory for equality-constrained statistical learning problems, showing that their solutions can be approximated using samples and rich parametrizations. Using these results, we propose a practical algorithm based on solving a sequence of unconstrained, empirical learning problems. We showcase its effectiveness and the new formulations enabled by equality constraints in fair learning, interpolating classifiers, and boundary value problems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种不可逆性正则化策略，通过在PINNs训练中强制执行热力学第二定律隐含的隐藏物理规律，显著提高了物理一致性并降低了预测误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PINNs在训练过程中常常忽略热力学第二定律隐含的不可逆性，导致产生非物理解甚至训练失败，需要一种方法来确保学习解符合不可逆物理过程的内在单向性。

Method: 引入简单、通用且鲁棒的不可逆性正则化策略，将隐藏物理规律作为软约束在训练中强制执行，仅需对现有PINN框架进行最小修改。

Result: 在多种基准测试（行波传播、稳态燃烧、冰融化、腐蚀演化和裂纹扩展）中，该正则化方案将预测误差降低了一个数量级以上。

Conclusion: 该框架广泛适用于PDE控制的物理系统，将在科学机器学习社区产生重要影响。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a new paradigm for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by integrating physical laws into the learning process of neural networks. However, despite their foundational role, the hidden irreversibility implied by the Second Law of Thermodynamics is often neglected during training, leading to unphysical solutions or even training failures in conventional PINNs. In this paper, we identify this critical gap and introduce a simple, generalized, yet robust irreversibility-regularized strategy that enforces hidden physical laws as soft constraints during training. This approach ensures that the learned solutions consistently respect the intrinsic one-way nature of irreversible physical processes. Across a wide range of benchmarks spanning traveling wave propagation, steady combustion, ice melting, corrosion evolution, and crack propagation, we demonstrate that our regularization scheme reduces predictive errors by more than an order of magnitude, while requiring only minimal modification to existing PINN frameworks. We believe that the proposed framework is broadly applicable to a wide class of PDE-governed physical systems and will have significant impact within the scientific machine learning community.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中的大模型适应面临安全威胁，特别是后门攻击，需要分析LoRA等参数高效微调技术对后门攻击的影响。

Method: 通过实验分析LoRA在不同秩设置下对最先进后门攻击的影响，重点关注后门寿命这一关键特性。

Result: 关键发现：对于最优注入的后门，LoRA秩越低，后门在攻击后的持久性越长。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了FL后门攻击评估的问题，有助于开发更鲁棒和公平的后门攻击评估方法，提高关键FL系统风险评估的可靠性。

Abstract: Large models adaptation through Federated Learning (FL) addresses a wide range of use cases and is enabled by Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). However, this distributed learning paradigm faces several security threats, particularly to its integrity, such as backdoor attacks that aim to inject malicious behavior during the local training steps of certain clients. We present the first analysis of the influence of LoRA on state-of-the-art backdoor attacks targeting model adaptation in FL. Specifically, we focus on backdoor lifespan, a critical characteristic in FL, that can vary depending on the attack scenario and the attacker's ability to effectively inject the backdoor. A key finding in our experiments is that for an optimally injected backdoor, the backdoor persistence after the attack is longer when the LoRA's rank is lower. Importantly, our work highlights evaluation issues of backdoor attacks against FL and contributes to the development of more robust and fair evaluations of backdoor attacks, enhancing the reliability of risk assessments for critical FL systems. Our code is publicly available.

Motivation: 现有通用到定制化跨模态检索方法假设目标域数据完全可用，但现实中查询以在线方式到达且具有多样性，导致查询偏移问题，破坏公共空间结构并使模型遗忘通用知识。

Method: REST方法：1) 针对在线偏移，精炼检索结果形成查询预测并设计鲁棒目标函数；2) 针对多样偏移，使用梯度解耦模块操纵适应过程中的梯度，防止模型遗忘通用知识。

Result: 在3个跨模态检索任务的20个基准测试上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: REST方法能够有效应对查询偏移问题，实现在线和协调的适应，保持公共空间结构和通用知识。

Abstract: Recently, the general-to-customized paradigm has emerged as the dominant approach for Cross-Modal Retrieval (CMR), which reconciles the distribution shift problem between the source domain and the target domain. However, existing general-to-customized CMR methods typically assume that the entire target-domain data is available, which is easily violated in real-world scenarios and thus inevitably suffer from the query shift (QS) problem. Specifically, query shift embraces the following two characteristics and thus poses new challenges to CMR. i) Online Shift: real-world queries always arrive in an online manner, rendering it impractical to access the entire query set beforehand for customization approaches; ii) Diverse Shift: even with domain customization, the CMR models struggle to satisfy queries from diverse users or scenarios, leaving an urgent need to accommodate diverse queries. In this paper, we observe that QS would not only undermine the well-structured common space inherited from the source model, but also steer the model toward forgetting the indispensable general knowledge for CMR. Inspired by the observations, we propose a novel method for achieving online and harmonious adaptation against QS, dubbed Robust adaptation with quEry ShifT (REST). To deal with online shift, REST first refines the retrieval results to formulate the query predictions and accordingly designs a QS-robust objective function on these predictions to preserve the well-established common space in an online manner. As for tackling the more challenging diverse shift, REST employs a gradient decoupling module to dexterously manipulate the gradients during the adaptation process, thus preventing the CMR model from forgetting the general knowledge. Extensive experiments on 20 benchmarks across three CMR tasks verify the effectiveness of our method against QS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ComplexEye等高通量成像平台产生指数级增长的数据，给存储和传输带来巨大负担，需要高效的压缩方法。

Method: FlowRoI通过估计连续帧间的光流来提取RoI掩码，覆盖几乎所有迁移细胞，然后使用JPEG2000进行RoI感知的联合编码压缩。

Result: FlowRoI计算效率高，在现代笔记本电脑上达到约30帧/秒的处理速度，在细胞区域获得更高的PSNR，在相同PSNR下压缩率比标准JPEG2000高2.0-2.2倍。

Conclusion: FlowRoI为高通量免疫细胞迁移研究提供了一种高效的数据压缩解决方案，平衡了图像质量和存储效率。

Abstract: Autonomous migration is essential for the function of immune cells such as neutrophils and plays a pivotal role in diverse diseases. Recently, we introduced ComplexEye, a multi-lens array microscope comprising 16 independent aberration-corrected glass lenses arranged at the pitch of a 96-well plate, capable of capturing high-resolution movies of migrating cells. This architecture enables high-throughput live-cell video microscopy for migration analysis, supporting routine quantification of autonomous motility with strong potential for clinical translation. However, ComplexEye and similar high-throughput imaging platforms generate data at an exponential rate, imposing substantial burdens on storage and transmission. To address this challenge, we present FlowRoI, a fast optical-flow-based region of interest (RoI) extraction framework designed for high-throughput image compression in immune cell migration studies. FlowRoI estimates optical flow between consecutive frames and derives RoI masks that reliably cover nearly all migrating cells. The raw image and its corresponding RoI mask are then jointly encoded using JPEG2000 to enable RoI-aware compression. FlowRoI operates with high computational efficiency, achieving runtimes comparable to standard JPEG2000 and reaching an average throughput of about 30 frames per second on a modern laptop equipped with an Intel i7-1255U CPU. In terms of image quality, FlowRoI yields higher peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) in cellular regions and achieves 2.0-2.2x higher compression rates at matched PSNR compared to standard JPEG2000.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在生成晶体材料时无法改变原子数量，这限制了采样的多样性。

Method: 引入mirage infusion技术，允许原子在存在和非存在状态之间转换，构建了MiAD模型——一个等变联合扩散模型。

Result: 模型质量提升2.5倍，在MP-20数据集上达到8.2%的S.U.N.率，显著超越现有最优方法。

Conclusion: MiAD通过允许改变原子数量，有效解决了扩散模型在晶体生成中的限制，大幅提升了性能。

Abstract: In recent years, diffusion-based models have demonstrated exceptional performance in searching for simultaneously stable, unique, and novel (S.U.N.) crystalline materials. However, most of these models don't have the ability to change the number of atoms in the crystal during the generation process, which limits the variability of model sampling trajectories. In this paper, we demonstrate the severity of this restriction and introduce a simple yet powerful technique, mirage infusion, which enables diffusion models to change the state of the atoms that make up the crystal from existent to non-existent (mirage) and vice versa. We show that this technique improves model quality by up to $\times2.5$ compared to the same model without this modification. The resulting model, Mirage Atom Diffusion (MiAD), is an equivariant joint diffusion model for de novo crystal generation that is capable of altering the number of atoms during the generation process. MiAD achieves an $8.2\%$ S.U.N. rate on the MP-20 dataset, which substantially exceeds existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Motivation: 连续心血管监测对精准健康至关重要，但关键心脏生物标志物（如心搏量和心输出量）通常需要侵入性测量。PPG作为非侵入性替代方案存在预测挑战且缺乏标注数据。

Method: 使用条件变分自编码器处理配对PPG-APW数据，结合基于模拟APW片段的条件密度估计器来预测心脏生物标志物。

Conclusion: 提出的混合方法为从PPG信号非侵入性估计心血管生物标志物提供了可行解决方案，在连续心血管监测中具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Continuous cardiovascular monitoring can play a key role in precision health. However, some fundamental cardiac biomarkers of interest, including stroke volume and cardiac output, require invasive measurements, e.g., arterial pressure waveforms (APW). As a non-invasive alternative, photoplethysmography (PPG) measurements are routinely collected in hospital settings. Unfortunately, the prediction of key cardiac biomarkers from PPG instead of APW remains an open challenge, further complicated by the scarcity of annotated PPG measurements. As a solution, we propose a hybrid approach that uses hemodynamic simulations and unlabeled clinical data to estimate cardiovascular biomarkers directly from PPG signals. Our hybrid model combines a conditional variational autoencoder trained on paired PPG-APW data with a conditional density estimator of cardiac biomarkers trained on labeled simulated APW segments. As a key result, our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach can detect fluctuations of cardiac output and stroke volume and outperform a supervised baseline in monitoring temporal changes in these biomarkers.

TL;DR: 提出条件前推神经网络（CPFN），一种用于条件分布估计的生成框架，通过学习随机映射来近似条件分布，支持高效的条件采样和统计量估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统条件密度估计方法存在计算复杂、训练困难等问题，需要一种既能高效采样又易于训练的生成式条件分布估计方法。

Method: 学习随机映射φ(x,u)，使得φ(x,U)与Y|X=x的分布近似相同，使用基于Kullback-Leibler散度的目标函数训练，无需可逆性或对抗训练。

Result: CPFN在实验中表现出与最先进方法（包括核估计、树基算法和深度学习技术）相当甚至更优的性能，同时保持轻量级和易训练特性。

Conclusion: CPFN提供了一种有效且实用的条件分布估计框架，在保持竞争力的同时简化了训练过程，适用于各种条件统计量的估计任务。

Abstract: We introduce conditional push-forward neural networks (CPFN), a generative framework for conditional distribution estimation. Instead of directly modeling the conditional density $f_{Y|X}$, CPFN learns a stochastic map $\varphi=\varphi(x,u)$ such that $\varphi(x,U)$ and $Y|X=x$ follow approximately the same law, with $U$ a suitable random vector of pre-defined latent variables. This enables efficient conditional sampling and straightforward estimation of conditional statistics through Monte Carlo methods. The model is trained via an objective function derived from a Kullback-Leibler formulation, without requiring invertibility or adversarial training. We establish a near-asymptotic consistency result and demonstrate experimentally that CPFN can achieve performance competitive with, or even superior to, state-of-the-art methods, including kernel estimators, tree-based algorithms, and popular deep learning techniques, all while remaining lightweight and easy to train.

TL;DR: nnterp是一个轻量级包装器，为Transformer分析提供统一接口，同时保留原始HuggingFace实现，解决了当前工具在一致性和准确性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机制可解释性研究工具面临基本权衡：自定义实现确保接口一致但需要手动适配每个架构且引入数值不匹配，而直接使用HuggingFace保持精确行为但缺乏跨模型标准化。

Method: 开发nnterp作为NNsight的轻量级包装器，通过自动模块重命名和全面验证测试，提供Transformer分析的统一接口。

Result: nnterp使研究人员能够编写一次干预代码并在50+模型变体和16个架构家族中部署，包含常见可解释性方法的实现，并提供对注意力概率的直接访问。

Conclusion: nnterp在机制可解释性工具中弥合了正确性和可用性之间的差距。

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability research requires reliable tools for analyzing transformer internals across diverse architectures. Current approaches face a fundamental tradeoff: custom implementations like TransformerLens ensure consistent interfaces but require coding a manual adaptation for each architecture, introducing numerical mismatch with the original models, while direct HuggingFace access through NNsight preserves exact behavior but lacks standardization across models. To bridge this gap, we develop nnterp, a lightweight wrapper around NNsight that provides a unified interface for transformer analysis while preserving original HuggingFace implementations. Through automatic module renaming and comprehensive validation testing, nnterp enables researchers to write intervention code once and deploy it across 50+ model variants spanning 16 architecture families. The library includes built-in implementations of common interpretability methods (logit lens, patchscope, activation steering) and provides direct access to attention probabilities for models that support it. By packaging validation tests with the library, researchers can verify compatibility with custom models locally. nnterp bridges the gap between correctness and usability in mechanistic interpretability tooling.

Conclusion: PAFM通过扰动感知建模有效解决了时间序列生成中的结构一致性问题，为处理扰动时间序列提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Time series generation is critical for a wide range of applications, which greatly supports downstream analytical and decision-making tasks. However, the inherent temporal heterogeneous induced by localized perturbations present significant challenges for generating structurally consistent time series. While flow matching provides a promising paradigm by modeling temporal dynamics through trajectory-level supervision, it fails to adequately capture abrupt transitions in perturbed time series, as the use of globally shared parameters constrains the velocity field to a unified representation. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{PAFM}, a \textbf{P}erturbation-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{F}low \textbf{M}atching framework that models perturbed trajectories to ensure stable and structurally consistent time series generation. The framework incorporates perturbation-guided training to simulate localized disturbances and leverages a dual-path velocity field to capture trajectory deviations under perturbation, enabling refined modeling of perturbed behavior to enhance the structural coherence. In order to further improve sensitivity to trajectory perturbations while enhancing expressiveness, a mixture-of-experts decoder with flow routing dynamically allocates modeling capacity in response to different trajectory dynamics. Extensive experiments on both unconditional and conditional generation tasks demonstrate that PAFM consistently outperforms strong baselines.

Abstract: The growth of million-token LLMs exposes the scalability limits of inference systems, where the KVCache dominates memory usage and data transfer overhead. Recent offloading systems migrate the KVCache to CPU memory and incorporate top-k attention to reduce the volume of data transferred from the CPU, while further applying system-level optimizations such as on-GPU caching and prefetching to lower transfer overhead. However, they overlook the CPU bottleneck in three aspects: (1) substantial overhead of fine-grained dynamic cache management performed on the CPU side, (2) significant transfer overhead from poor PCIe bandwidth utilization caused by heavy gathering operations at the CPU side, and (3) GPU runtime bubbles introduced by coarse-grained CPU-centric synchronization. To address these challenges, we propose CLO, a CPU-light KVCache offloading system via algorithm-system co-design. CLO features: (1) a coarse-grained head-wise approximate on-GPU caching strategy with negligible cache management cost, (2) seamless combination of data prefetching and on-GPU persistent caching for lower transfer overhead, (3) a zero-copy transfer engine to fully exploit PCIe bandwidth, and a GPU-centric synchronization method to eliminate GPU stalls. Evaluation on two widely-used LLMs demonstrates that CLO achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art systems, while substantially minimizing CPU overhead, fully utilizing PCIe bandwidth, thus improving decoding throughput by 9.3%-66.6%. Our results highlight that algorithm-system co-design is essential for memory-constrained LLM inference on modern GPU platforms. We open source CLO at https://github.com/CommediaJW/CLO.

Abstract: Diffusion and flow matching models have recently emerged as promising approaches for peptide binder design. Despite their progress, these models still face two major challenges. First, categorical sampling of discrete residue types collapses their continuous parameters into onehot assignments, while continuous variables (e.g., atom positions) evolve smoothly throughout the generation process. This mismatch disrupts the update dynamics and results in suboptimal performance. Second, current models assume unimodal distributions for side-chain torsion angles, which conflicts with the inherently multimodal nature of side chain rotameric states and limits prediction accuracy. To address these limitations, we introduce PepBFN, the first Bayesian flow network for full atom peptide design that directly models parameter distributions in fully continuous space. Specifically, PepBFN models discrete residue types by learning their continuous parameter distributions, enabling joint and smooth Bayesian updates with other continuous structural parameters. It further employs a novel Gaussian mixture based Bayesian flow to capture the multimodal side chain rotameric states and a Matrix Fisher based Riemannian flow to directly model residue orientations on the $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ manifold. Together, these parameter distributions are progressively refined via Bayesian updates, yielding smooth and coherent peptide generation. Experiments on side chain packing, reverse folding, and binder design tasks demonstrate the strong potential of PepBFN in computational peptide design.

Abstract: Incomplete data are common in real-world tabular applications, where numerical, categorical, and discrete attributes coexist within a single dataset. This heterogeneous structure presents significant challenges for existing diffusion-based imputation models, which typically assume a homogeneous feature space and rely on stochastic denoising trajectories. Such assumptions make it difficult to maintain conditional consistency, and they often lead to information collapse for categorical variables or instability when numerical variables require deterministic updates. These limitations indicate that a single diffusion process is insufficient for mixed-type tabular imputation.
  We propose a hybrid deterministic diffusion framework that separates heterogeneous features into two complementary generative channels. A continuous DDIM-based channel provides efficient and stable deterministic denoising for numerical variables, while a discrete latent-path diffusion channel, inspired by loopholing-based discrete diffusion, models categorical and discrete features without leaving their valid sample manifolds. The two channels are trained under a unified conditional imputation objective, enabling coherent reconstruction of mixed-type incomplete data.
  Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets show that the proposed framework achieves higher imputation accuracy, more stable sampling trajectories, and improved robustness across MCAR, MAR, and MNAR settings compared with existing diffusion-based and classical methods. These results demonstrate the importance of structure-aware diffusion processes for advancing deep learning approaches to incomplete tabular data.

Result: WI能够量化降维投影中的视觉扭曲程度，特别是对异常值和伪影的敏感性。

Conclusion: WI为降维投影质量评估提供了新的视角，强调空区域保持对视觉分析可靠性的重要性。

Abstract: Dimensionality Reduction (DR) techniques are commonly used for the visual exploration and analysis of high-dimensional data due to their ability to project datasets of high-dimensional points onto the 2D plane. However, projecting datasets in lower dimensions often entails some distortion, which is not necessarily easy to recognize but can lead users to misleading conclusions. Several Projection Quality Metrics (PQMs) have been developed as tools to quantify the goodness-of-fit of a DR projection; however, they mostly focus on measuring how well the projection captures the global or local structure of the data, without taking into account the visual distortion of the resulting plots, thus often ignoring the presence of outliers or artifacts that can mislead a visual analysis of the projection. In this work, we introduce the Warping Index (WI), a new metric for measuring the quality of DR projections onto the 2D plane, based on the assumption that the correct preservation of empty regions between points is of crucial importance towards a faithful visual representation of the data.

Result: 发现预训练闭词汇视觉变换器也能通过任务算术进行编辑，实现高效的多任务模型部署，且线性探测是任务加法的竞争性基准方法。

Conclusion: 任务算术的适用范围扩展到更广泛的预训练模型类别，为在不同设置中更高效地使用预训练模型开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Task arithmetic has recently emerged as a promising method for editing pre-trained \textit{open-vocabulary} models, offering a cost-effective alternative to standard multi-task fine-tuning. However, despite the abundance of \textit{closed-vocabulary} models that are not pre-trained with language supervision, applying task arithmetic to these models remains unexplored. In this paper, we deploy and study task addition in closed-vocabulary image classification models. We consider different pre-training schemes and find that \textit{weight disentanglement} -- the property enabling task arithmetic -- is a general consequence of pre-training, as it appears in different pre-trained closed-vocabulary models. In fact, we find that pre-trained closed-vocabulary vision transformers can also be edited with task arithmetic, achieving high task addition performance and enabling the efficient deployment of multi-task models. Finally, we demonstrate that simple linear probing is a competitive baseline to task addition. Overall, our findings expand the applicability of task arithmetic to a broader class of pre-trained models and open the way for more efficient use of pre-trained models in diverse settings.

Motivation: 解决智能体从经验中学习并在多样化任务中实现泛化而无需任务特定训练的基本挑战，探索互补学习机制的协同整合潜力。

Method: 结合三种互补机制：LLM分层TODO分解用于策略规划、历史感知因果反思分析行动模式识别失败原因、梯度优化进行系统性改进。

Result: 在ALFWorld基准测试中实现67%的零样本成功率，无需任何先验任务经验或演示，有效性能在首次接触时即建立。

Conclusion: 互补学习机制的协同整合能够实现稳健的零样本泛化，接近先前工作中的少样本基线性能。

Abstract: Enabling agents to learn from experience and generalize across diverse tasks without task-specific training remains a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning and decision-making. While recent approaches have explored episodic memory (Reflexion), gradient-based prompt optimization (TextGrad),and hierarchical task decomposition independently, their potential for synergistic integration remains unexplored. We introduce ReflexGrad, a novel architecture that tightly couples three complementary mechanisms: (1) LLM-based hierarchical TODO decomposition for strategic planning, (2) history-aware causal reflection that analyzes recent action patterns to identify failure root causes and enable within-trial learning, and (3) gradient-based optimization for systematic improvement. Unlike prior work relying on few-shot demonstrations, our system achieves true zero-shot generalization through pure LLM semantic reasoning,requiring no task-specific examples, fine-tuning, or hardcoded similarity metrics. Evaluated on ALFWorld benchmark tasks, ReflexGrad demonstrates 67% zero-shot success rate on Trial 0 without any prior task experience or demonstrations, establishing effective performance on first exposure. Through empirical analysis, we identify the architectural mechanisms underlying stable convergence (zero action loops) and effective cross-task transfer (67% to 78% improvement).Our work demonstrates that synergistic integration of complementary learning mechanisms enables robust zero-shot generalization that approaches few-shot baselines from prior work.

Motivation: 从有限数据中学习部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程(POMDPs)的参数是一个重大挑战，特别是在医疗领域数据稀缺的情况下。

Method: 通过专家定义的模糊模型生成模糊伪计数，将其整合到期望最大化(EM)框架中，将问题重新表述为最大后验(MAP)估计问题。

Result: 在合成医疗模拟中，该方法在低数据和高噪声条件下始终优于标准EM算法；在重症肌无力案例研究中成功恢复了临床一致的POMDP模型。

Conclusion: Fuzzy MAP EM算法展示了作为医疗保健领域数据高效建模实用工具的潜力。

Abstract: Learning the parameters of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) from limited data is a significant challenge. We introduce the Fuzzy MAP EM algorithm, a novel approach that incorporates expert knowledge into the parameter estimation process by enriching the Expectation Maximization (EM) framework with fuzzy pseudo-counts derived from an expert-defined fuzzy model. This integration naturally reformulates the problem as a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation, effectively guiding learning in environments with limited data. In synthetic medical simulations, our method consistently outperforms the standard EM algorithm under both low-data and high-noise conditions. Furthermore, a case study on Myasthenia Gravis illustrates the ability of the Fuzzy MAP EM algorithm to recover a clinically coherent POMDP, demonstrating its potential as a practical tool for data-efficient modeling in healthcare.

*Ivy Yuqian Yang,David Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 现代大型语言模型在遵循简单概率分布方面严重失败，即使要求以49%概率输出"1"，模型也会几乎100%输出"0"，表现出类似阶跃函数的行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学创意生成和选择需要遵循目标概率分布进行探索，而当前AI基准测试有客观正确答案，通过强化学习训练LLM会抑制概率探索行为。

Method: 进行系统实验，要求LLM按照简单概率分布生成输出，测试其遵循分布的能力。

Result: 所有测试的现代LLM都严重无法遵循概率分布，即使要求以49%概率输出"1"，模型也会几乎100%输出"0"，这种阶跃函数行为甚至压倒了LLM内在的强偏见。

Conclusion: 现代LLM缺乏遵循概率分布的能力，这限制了它们在需要概率探索的科学创意生成等任务中的应用。

Abstract: Scientific idea generation and selection requires exploration following a target probability distribution. In contrast, current AI benchmarks have objectively correct answers, and training large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning against these benchmarks discourages probabilistic exploration. Here, we conducted systematic experiments requesting LLMs to produce outputs following simple probabilistic distributions, and found that all modern LLMs tested grossly fail to follow the distributions. For example, requesting a binary output of "1" 49% of the time produces an answer of "0" nearly 100% of the time. This step function-like behavior of near-exclusively generating the output with marginally highest probability even overrules even strong in-built LLM biases.

TL;DR: Adapformer是一个基于Transformer的多变量时间序列预测框架，通过自适应通道管理结合了通道独立和通道依赖方法的优势，在预测准确性和计算效率方面都达到了最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多变量时间序列预测方法存在局限性：通道独立方法无法利用通道间交互信息，通道依赖方法容易引入过多无关信息导致过拟合。需要一种能平衡这两种策略的方法。

Method: 采用双阶段编码器-解码器架构，包含自适应通道增强器(ACE)用于选择性整合关键依赖关系来丰富嵌入表示，以及自适应通道预测器(ACF)用于精简解码过程，专注于最相关的协变量。

Result: 在多个数据集上的严格测试表明，Adapformer在预测准确性和计算效率方面均优于现有模型，达到了最先进水平。

Conclusion: Adapformer通过有效的通道管理成功结合了通道独立和通道依赖方法的优势，显著减少了噪声和冗余，在多变量时间序列预测任务中表现出色。

Abstract: In multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF), accurately modeling the intricate dependencies among multiple variables remains a significant challenge due to the inherent limitations of traditional approaches. Most existing models adopt either \textbf{channel-independent} (CI) or \textbf{channel-dependent} (CD) strategies, each presenting distinct drawbacks. CI methods fail to leverage the potential insights from inter-channel interactions, resulting in models that may not fully exploit the underlying statistical dependencies present in the data. Conversely, CD approaches often incorporate too much extraneous information, risking model overfitting and predictive inefficiency. To address these issues, we introduce the Adaptive Forecasting Transformer (\textbf{Adapformer}), an advanced Transformer-based framework that merges the benefits of CI and CD methodologies through effective channel management. The core of Adapformer lies in its dual-stage encoder-decoder architecture, which includes the \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{C}hannel \textbf{E}nhancer (\textbf{ACE}) for enriching embedding processes and the \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{C}hannel \textbf{F}orecaster (\textbf{ACF}) for refining the predictions. ACE enhances token representations by selectively incorporating essential dependencies, while ACF streamlines the decoding process by focusing on the most relevant covariates, substantially reducing noise and redundancy. Our rigorous testing on diverse datasets shows that Adapformer achieves superior performance over existing models, enhancing both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency, thus making it state-of-the-art in MTSF.

TL;DR: 本研究系统评估了机器学习方法在吸烟相关健康风险评估中的应用，发现随机森林模型表现最佳（AUC=0.926），关键健康指标包括血压、甘油三酯、肝酶和肾功能指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 吸烟是全球主要的可预防死亡原因，但现有医疗筛查方法往往错过早期预警信号，导致晚期诊断。需要开发更有效的风险评估工具。

Method: 使用55,691人的健康筛查数据，比较随机森林、XGBoost和LightGBM三种算法，采用横断面设计基于生物标志物分类当前吸烟状态，并使用SHAP分析解释模型。

Result: 随机森林模型表现最佳（AUC=0.926），SHAP分析显示血压、甘油三酯、肝酶和血清肌酐是最重要的预测指标。

Conclusion: 机器学习方法可以有效识别吸烟相关健康风险，随机森林结合SHAP分析提供了临床可解释的风险评估工具，有助于早期干预。

Abstract: Smoking continues to be a major preventable cause of death worldwide, affecting millions through damage to the heart, metabolism, liver, and kidneys. However, current medical screening methods often miss the early warning signs of smoking-related health problems, leading to late-stage diagnoses when treatment options become limited. This study presents a systematic comparative evaluation of machine learning approaches for smoking-related health risk assessment, emphasizing clinical interpretability and practical deployment over algorithmic innovation. We analyzed health screening data from 55,691 individuals, examining various health indicators, including body measurements, blood tests, and demographic information. We tested three advanced prediction algorithms - Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM - to determine which could most accurately identify people at high risk. This study employed a cross-sectional design to classify current smoking status based on health screening biomarkers, not to predict future disease development. Our Random Forest model performed best, achieving an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.926, meaning it could reliably distinguish between high-risk and lower-risk individuals. Using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis to understand what the model was detecting, we found that key health markers played crucial roles in prediction: blood pressure levels, triglyceride concentrations, liver enzyme readings, and kidney function indicators (serum creatinine) were the strongest signals of declining health in smokers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习防御机制依赖静态阈值和二元分类，无法适应现实部署中不断演变的客户端行为，需要更灵活的自适应防御方案。

Method: 提出多维度信誉评分系统、自校准自适应阈值机制、信誉加权聚合与软排除、本地差分隐私保护的信誉评分，并引入统计模拟攻击作为基准测试。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR-10和SVHN数据集上的实验表明，FLARE在多种攻击类型下保持高模型精度，收敛速度优于现有方法，鲁棒性提升达16%。

Conclusion: FLARE框架能有效防御联邦学习中的恶意客户端攻击，在保持隐私保护的同时显著提升系统安全性和收敛性能。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while preserving data privacy. However, it remains vulnerable to malicious clients who compromise model integrity through Byzantine attacks, data poisoning, or adaptive adversarial behaviors. Existing defense mechanisms rely on static thresholds and binary classification, failing to adapt to evolving client behaviors in real-world deployments. We propose FLARE, an adaptive reputation-based framework that transforms client reliability assessment from binary decisions to a continuous, multi-dimensional trust evaluation. FLARE integrates: (i) a multi-dimensional reputation score capturing performance consistency, statistical anomaly indicators, and temporal behavior, (ii) a self-calibrating adaptive threshold mechanism that adjusts security strictness based on model convergence and recent attack intensity, (iii) reputation-weighted aggregation with soft exclusion to proportionally limit suspicious contributions rather than eliminating clients outright, and (iv) a Local Differential Privacy (LDP) mechanism enabling reputation scoring on privatized client updates. We further introduce a highly evasive Statistical Mimicry (SM) attack, a benchmark adversary that blends honest gradients with synthetic perturbations and persistent drift to remain undetected by traditional filters. Extensive experiments with 100 clients on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN demonstrate that FLARE maintains high model accuracy and converges faster than state-of-the-art Byzantine-robust methods under diverse attack types, including label flipping, gradient scaling, adaptive attacks, ALIE, and SM. FLARE improves robustness by up to 16% and preserves model convergence within 30% of the non-attacked baseline, while achieving strong malicious-client detection performance with minimal computational overhead. https://github.com/Anonymous0-0paper/FLARE

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出AdamHuberDecay作为AdamW的替代方案，使用解耦的平滑Huber正则化器替代ℓ₂惩罚，在预训练GPT模型时实现更快的收敛、更好的性能和更高的稀疏性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AdamW中的ℓ₂惩罚使所有参数以相同速率趋向原点，对罕见但极端的梯度方向敏感，且经常过度惩罚条件良好的坐标。

Method: 使用解耦的平滑Huber正则化器，参数低于阈值δ时二次衰减，超过δ时线性衰减，实现有界正则化梯度和对过增长权重的更强稀疏压力。

Result: 在GPT-2和GPT-3预训练中：收敛速度提高10-15%，验证困惑度降低最多4点，下游任务性能提升2.5-4.7%，幅度剪枝后内存节省20-30%。

Conclusion: AdamHuberDecay为下一代基础生成变换器的训练提供了简单、有原则的路径，实现更高效和鲁棒的训练。

Abstract: Adaptive optimizers with decoupled weight decay, such as AdamW, are the de facto standard for pre-training large transformer-based generative models. Yet the quadratic nature of the $\ell_2$ penalty embedded in weight decay drives all parameters toward the origin at the same rate, making the update vulnerable to rare but extreme gradient directions and often over-penalizing well-conditioned coordinates. We propose AdamHuberDecay, a drop-in replacement for AdamW that substitutes the $\ell_2$ penalty with a decoupled smooth Huber regularizer. The resulting update decays parameters quadratically while their magnitude remains below a threshold $δ$, and linearly ($\ell_1$-like) once they exceed $δ$, yielding (i) bounded regularization gradients, (ii) invariance to per-coordinate second-moment rescaling, and (iii) stronger sparsity pressure on overgrown weights.
  We derive the closed-form decoupled Huber decay step and show how to integrate it with any Adam-family optimizer at $O(1)$ extra cost. Extensive experiments on GPT-2 and GPT-3 pre-training demonstrate that AdamHuberDecay (a) converges 10-15% faster in wall-clock time, (b) reduces validation perplexity by up to 4 points, (c) delivers performance improvements of 2.5-4.7% across downstream tasks, and (d) yields visibly sparser weight histograms that translate into 20-30% memory savings after magnitude pruning, without tuning the decay coefficient beyond the default grid used for AdamW. Ablations confirm robustness to outlier gradients and large-batch regimes, together with theoretical analyses that bound the expected parameter norm under noisy updates. AdamHuberDecay therefore provides a simple, principled path toward more efficient and resilient training of next-generation foundational generative transformers.

Motivation: 现实场景中缺乏标注数据导致无法获得高性能模型，迫使从业者依赖繁琐低效的基于提示的方法。

Method: 提出LAUD学习框架，将大语言模型与主动学习结合，使用零样本学习构建初始标签集来缓解冷启动问题。

Result: 实验结果显示，LAUD框架下的大语言模型在商品名称分类任务上优于零样本或少样本学习。

Conclusion: LAUD框架有效解决了缺乏标注数据的问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown a remarkable ability to generalize beyond their pre-training data, and fine-tuning LLMs can elevate performance to human-level and beyond. However, in real-world scenarios, lacking labeled data often prevents practitioners from obtaining well-performing models, thereby forcing practitioners to highly rely on prompt-based approaches that are often tedious, inefficient, and driven by trial and error. To alleviate this issue of lacking labeled data, we present a learning framework integrating LLMs with active learning for unlabeled dataset (LAUD). LAUD mitigates the cold-start problem by constructing an initial label set with zero-shot learning. Experimental results show that LLMs derived from LAUD outperform LLMs with zero-shot or few-shot learning on commodity name classification tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of LAUD.

Motivation: 传统评分聚合方法（如样本均值）无法适应质量随时间变化且忽略评论异质性（如评论情感、有用性），需要更智能的评分聚合方法。

Method: 使用高斯过程框架构建定制化模型，捕捉评分随时间变化的动态性，同时考虑评论异质性因素。

Result: 基于121,123条Yelp评分的实验表明，高斯过程模型在预测未来评分方面显著更准确，平均绝对误差比样本均值降低10.2%。

Conclusion: 在线声誉系统设计者应采用超越均值的方法，展示更具信息性和适应性的聚合评分，为顾客提供更准确的满意度预期信号。

Abstract: Online ratings influence customer decision-making, yet standard aggregation methods, such as the sample mean, fail to adapt to quality changes over time and ignore review heterogeneity (e.g., review sentiment, a review's helpfulness). To address these challenges, we demonstrate the value of using the Gaussian process (GP) framework for rating aggregation. Specifically, we present a tailored GP model that captures the dynamics of ratings over time while additionally accounting for review heterogeneity. Based on 121,123 ratings from Yelp, we compare the predictive power of different rating aggregation methods in predicting future ratings, thereby finding that the GP model is considerably more accurate and reduces the mean absolute error by 10.2% compared to the sample mean. Our findings have important implications for marketing practitioners and customers. By moving beyond means, designers of online reputation systems can display more informative and adaptive aggregated rating scores that are accurate signals of expected customer satisfaction.

Abstract: Deep learning's rise since the early 2010s has transformed fields like computer vision and natural language processing and strongly influenced biomedical research. For drug discovery specifically, a key inflection - akin to vision's "ImageNet moment" - arrived in 2015, when deep neural networks surpassed traditional approaches on the Tox21 Data Challenge. This milestone accelerated the adoption of deep learning across the pharmaceutical industry, and today most major companies have integrated these methods into their research pipelines. After the Tox21 Challenge concluded, its dataset was included in several established benchmarks, such as MoleculeNet and the Open Graph Benchmark. However, during these integrations, the dataset was altered and labels were imputed or manufactured, resulting in a loss of comparability across studies. Consequently, the extent to which bioactivity and toxicity prediction methods have improved over the past decade remains unclear. To this end, we introduce a reproducible leaderboard, hosted on Hugging Face with the original Tox21 Challenge dataset, together with a set of baseline and representative methods. The current version of the leaderboard indicates that the original Tox21 winner - the ensemble-based DeepTox method - and the descriptor-based self-normalizing neural networks introduced in 2017, continue to perform competitively and rank among the top methods for toxicity prediction, leaving it unclear whether substantial progress in toxicity prediction has been achieved over the past decade. As part of this work, we make all baselines and evaluated models publicly accessible for inference via standardized API calls to Hugging Face Spaces.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了学习平台中用户的前瞻性推理行为，包括个体层面的层级思维和集体层面的协调行动，分析了这些行为对模型预测的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习平台的优化标准往往反映设计者而非用户的优先级，导致用户采取策略性行为来获取更有利的结果。过去研究主要关注用户对已部署模型的策略响应，而忽略了用户间的相互影响。

Method: 首先形式化了行为经济学中的层级思维概念，用户通过向前看一步来超越同伴；然后研究了集体推理，用户通过协调行动来优化对模型的联合影响。

Result: 层级思维加速了均衡收敛但均衡状态不变，高层次的个体推理在长期没有益处；集体协调与自私行为的对比揭示了协调的收益和限制，学习者和用户效用之间的对齐成为关键概念。

Conclusion: 前瞻性推理框架揭示了用户行为耦合对模型预测的重要影响，集体协调行为与个体自私行为的对比为理解平台与用户利益对齐提供了新视角。

Abstract: On many learning platforms, the optimization criteria guiding model training reflect the priorities of the designer rather than those of the individuals they affect. Consequently, users may act strategically to obtain more favorable outcomes, effectively contesting the platform's predictions. While past work has studied strategic user behavior on learning platforms, the focus has largely been on strategic responses to a deployed model, without considering the behavior of other users. In contrast, look-ahead reasoning takes into account that user actions are coupled, and -- at scale -- impact future predictions. Within this framework, we first formalize level-$k$ thinking, a concept from behavioral economics, where users aim to outsmart their peers by looking one step ahead. We show that, while convergence to an equilibrium is accelerated, the equilibrium remains the same, providing no benefit of higher-level reasoning for individuals in the long run. Then, we focus on collective reasoning, where users take coordinated actions by optimizing through their joint impact on the model. By contrasting collective with selfish behavior, we characterize the benefits and limits of coordination; a new notion of alignment between the learner's and the users' utilities emerges as a key concept. We discuss connections to several related mathematical frameworks, including strategic classification, performative prediction, and algorithmic collective action.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ConvLSTM及其变体在时空数据挖掘中表现出色但计算成本高，不适用于资源受限的边缘设备。现有高效AI方法主要减少模型容量冗余，但时空数据挖掘需要大量模型容量，而数据和特征冗余却带来了不必要的计算负担。

Method: 开发SparseST框架，利用数据稀疏性构建高效时空模型，设计多目标复合损失函数来平衡模型性能和计算效率。

Result: SparseST通过利用数据冗余显著降低了计算成本，同时保持了模型性能，为资源受限环境提供了实用的解决方案。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了利用数据稀疏性而非模型压缩是时空数据挖掘中实现高效AI的有效途径，为边缘计算环境下的时空模型部署提供了新思路。

Abstract: Spatiotemporal data mining (STDM) has a wide range of applications in various complex physical systems (CPS), i.e., transportation, manufacturing, healthcare, etc. Among all the proposed methods, the Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) has proved to be generalizable and extendable in different applications and has multiple variants achieving state-of-the-art performance in various STDM applications. However, ConvLSTM and its variants are computationally expensive, which makes them inapplicable in edge devices with limited computational resources. With the emerging need for edge computing in CPS, efficient AI is essential to reduce the computational cost while preserving the model performance. Common methods of efficient AI are developed to reduce redundancy in model capacity (i.e., model pruning, compression, etc.). However, spatiotemporal data mining naturally requires extensive model capacity, as the embedded dependencies in spatiotemporal data are complex and hard to capture, which limits the model redundancy. Instead, there is a fairly high level of data and feature redundancy that introduces an unnecessary computational burden, which has been largely overlooked in existing research. Therefore, we developed a novel framework SparseST, that pioneered in exploiting data sparsity to develop an efficient spatiotemporal model. In addition, we explore and approximate the Pareto front between model performance and computational efficiency by designing a multi-objective composite loss function, which provides a practical guide for practitioners to adjust the model according to computational resource constraints and the performance requirements of downstream tasks.

Abstract: We study how vision-language-action (VLA) models can improve through real-world deployments via reinforcement learning (RL). We present a general-purpose method, RL with Experience and Corrections via Advantage-conditioned Policies (RECAP), that provides for RL training of VLAs via advantage conditioning. Our method incorporates heterogeneous data into the self-improvement process, including demonstrations, data from on-policy collection, and expert teleoperated interventions provided during autonomous execution. RECAP starts by pre-training a generalist VLA with offline RL, which we call $π^{*}_{0.6}$, that can then be specialized to attain high performance on downstream tasks through on-robot data collection. We show that the $π^{*}_{0.6}$ model trained with the full RECAP method can fold laundry in real homes, reliably assemble boxes, and make espresso drinks using a professional espresso machine. On some of the hardest tasks, RECAP more than doubles task throughput and roughly halves the task failure rate.
