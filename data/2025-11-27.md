### [1] [Are Neuro-Inspired Multi-Modal Vision-Language Models Resilient to Membership Inference Privacy Leakage?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20710)
*David Amebley,Sayanton Dibbo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种神经科学启发的拓扑正则化框架，用于增强多模态视觉语言模型对成员推理攻击的隐私保护能力，在保持模型效用的同时显著降低攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态模型的广泛应用，其训练数据隐私泄露风险日益突出。现有研究主要关注单模态系统的隐私攻击，而对多模态模型的隐私脆弱性研究不足。神经启发模型在对抗攻击中表现出色，但其在隐私攻击中的韧性尚未探索。

Method: 提出系统性神经科学启发的拓扑正则化框架(tau)，在三种视觉语言模型(BLIP、PaliGemma 2、ViT-GPT2)上应用，使用COCO、CC3M和NoCaps三个基准数据集进行实验，比较基线模型和神经变体模型的隐私韧性。

Result: 在BLIP模型上，神经变体VLM的成员推理攻击成功率平均ROC-AUC下降24%，同时保持相似的模型效用(MPNet和ROUGE-2指标)。在PaliGemma 2和ViT-GPT2模型上的进一步验证证实了结果的稳定性。

Conclusion: 神经启发的多模态视觉语言模型对隐私攻击具有更强的韧性，且不会显著损害模型效用，这为理解多模态模型的隐私风险提供了重要见解。

Abstract: In the age of agentic AI, the growing deployment of multi-modal models (MMs) has introduced new attack vectors that can leak sensitive training data in MMs, causing privacy leakage. This paper investigates a black-box privacy attack, i.e., membership inference attack (MIA) on multi-modal vision-language models (VLMs). State-of-the-art research analyzes privacy attacks primarily to unimodal AI-ML systems, while recent studies indicate MMs can also be vulnerable to privacy attacks. While researchers have demonstrated that biologically inspired neural network representations can improve unimodal model resilience against adversarial attacks, it remains unexplored whether neuro-inspired MMs are resilient against privacy attacks. In this work, we introduce a systematic neuroscience-inspired topological regularization (tau) framework to analyze MM VLMs resilience against image-text-based inference privacy attacks. We examine this phenomenon using three VLMs: BLIP, PaliGemma 2, and ViT-GPT2, across three benchmark datasets: COCO, CC3M, and NoCaps. Our experiments compare the resilience of baseline and neuro VLMs (with topological regularization), where the tau > 0 configuration defines the NEURO variant of VLM. Our results on the BLIP model using the COCO dataset illustrate that MIA attack success in NEURO VLMs drops by 24% mean ROC-AUC, while achieving similar model utility (similarities between generated and reference captions) in terms of MPNet and ROUGE-2 metrics. This shows neuro VLMs are comparatively more resilient against privacy attacks, while not significantly compromising model utility. Our extensive evaluation with PaliGemma 2 and ViT-GPT2 models, on two additional datasets: CC3M and NoCaps, further validates the consistency of the findings. This work contributes to the growing understanding of privacy risks in MMs and provides evidence on neuro VLMs privacy threat resilience.

### [2] [Pygmalion Effect in Vision: Image-to-Clay Translation for Reflective Geometry Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21098)
*Gayoung Lee,Junho Kim,Jin-Hwa Kim,Junmo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Pygmalion Effect框架，通过图像到黏土转换来抑制反射线索，提升反射物体的3D重建质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D重建中反射导致的表观和几何纠缠问题，反射使几何重建变得困难

Method: 使用双分支网络：基于BRDF的反射分支和黏土引导分支，联合训练合成无反射的黏土样图像作为监督信号

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上显著提升了法向精度和网格完整性，优于现有反射处理方法

Conclusion: 通过"去光泽化"将辐射度转换为中性表示，可作为反射物体几何学习的强大归纳偏置

Abstract: Understanding reflection remains a long-standing challenge in 3D reconstruction due to the entanglement of appearance and geometry under view-dependent reflections. In this work, we present the Pygmalion Effect in Vision, a novel framework that metaphorically "sculpts" reflective objects into clay-like forms through image-to-clay translation. Inspired by the myth of Pygmalion, our method learns to suppress specular cues while preserving intrinsic geometric consistency, enabling robust reconstruction from multi-view images containing complex reflections. Specifically, we introduce a dual-branch network in which a BRDF-based reflective branch is complemented by a clay-guided branch that stabilizes geometry and refines surface normals. The two branches are trained jointly using the synthesized clay-like images, which provide a neutral, reflection-free supervision signal that complements the reflective views. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate substantial improvement in normal accuracy and mesh completeness over existing reflection-handling methods. Beyond technical gains, our framework reveals that seeing by unshining, translating radiance into neutrality, can serve as a powerful inductive bias for reflective object geometry learning.

### [3] [Inferix: A Block-Diffusion based Next-Generation Inference Engine for World Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20714)
*Inferix Team,Tianyu Feng,Yizeng Han,Jiahao He,Yuanyu He,Xi Lin,Teng Liu,Hanfeng Lu,Jiasheng Tang,Wei Wang,Zhiyuan Wang,Jichao Wu,Mingyang Yang,Yinghao Yu,Zeyu Zhang,Bohan Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Inferix是一个专为世界模型设计的下一代推理引擎，通过优化的半自回归解码实现沉浸式世界合成，支持交互式视频流和评测，区别于高并发系统和传统视频扩散模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 世界模型是智能体AI、具身AI和游戏等领域的核心模拟器，能够生成长序列、物理真实且交互式的高质量视频。扩展这些模型可以解锁视觉感知、理解和推理的新兴能力，超越当前以LLM为中心的视觉基础模型。

Method: 采用半自回归（块扩散）解码范式，结合扩散和自回归方法的优势，在块内应用扩散生成视频token，同时以前面块为条件，实现更连贯稳定的视频序列。重新引入LLM风格的KV缓存管理，支持高效、可变长度和高质量生成。

Result: Inferix专门针对世界模拟设计，提供交互式视频流和性能分析功能，支持实时交互和真实模拟以准确建模世界动态。无缝集成LV-Bench评测基准，适用于分钟级视频生成场景的细粒度评估。

Conclusion: Inferix作为专门的世界模型推理引擎，通过优化的半自回归解码技术，为世界模型探索提供了新的可能性，希望社区共同推进其发展。

Abstract: World models serve as core simulators for fields such as agentic AI, embodied AI, and gaming, capable of generating long, physically realistic, and interactive high-quality videos. Moreover, scaling these models could unlock emergent capabilities in visual perception, understanding, and reasoning, paving the way for a new paradigm that moves beyond current LLM-centric vision foundation models. A key breakthrough empowering them is the semi-autoregressive (block-diffusion) decoding paradigm, which merges the strengths of diffusion and autoregressive methods by generating video tokens in block-applying diffusion within each block while conditioning on previous ones, resulting in more coherent and stable video sequences. Crucially, it overcomes limitations of standard video diffusion by reintroducing LLM-style KV Cache management, enabling efficient, variable-length, and high-quality generation.
  Therefore, Inferix is specifically designed as a next-generation inference engine to enable immersive world synthesis through optimized semi-autoregressive decoding processes. This dedicated focus on world simulation distinctly sets it apart from systems engineered for high-concurrency scenarios (like vLLM or SGLang) and from classic video diffusion models (such as xDiTs). Inferix further enhances its offering with interactive video streaming and profiling, enabling real-time interaction and realistic simulation to accurately model world dynamics. Additionally, it supports efficient benchmarking through seamless integration of LV-Bench, a new fine-grained evaluation benchmark tailored for minute-long video generation scenarios. We hope the community will work together to advance Inferix and foster world model exploration.

### [4] [CtrlVDiff: Controllable Video Generation via Unified Multimodal Video Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21129)
*Dianbing Xi,Jiepeng Wang,Yuanzhi Liang,Xi Qiu,Jialun Liu,Hao Pan,Yuchi Huo,Rui Wang,Haibin Huang,Chi Zhang,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CtrlVDiff是一个统一的扩散框架，通过多模态控制策略解决视频理解和可控生成的双重挑战，使用深度、法线、分割、边缘和图形内在属性等丰富线索，实现精确的视频编辑和生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统仅使用几何线索的方法在指定外观、材质和光照方面存在不足，限制了物理上有意义的编辑（如重新照明或材质交换），并常导致时间漂移。需要更丰富的图形基础模态来提供互补约束。

Method: 提出CtrlVDiff模型，采用混合模态控制策略，融合深度、法线、分割、边缘和图形内在属性等特征，并构建MMVideo混合数据集进行训练，支持任意子集的模态输入。

Result: 在理解和生成基准测试中，CtrlVDiff实现了优越的可控性和保真度，支持分层编辑（重新照明、材质调整、对象插入），并在某些模态不可用时保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过整合丰富的图形基础模态，CtrlVDiff在视频理解和可控生成方面超越了现有方法，实现了更精确和一致的视频编辑能力。

Abstract: We tackle the dual challenges of video understanding and controllable video generation within a unified diffusion framework. Our key insights are two-fold: geometry-only cues (e.g., depth, edges) are insufficient: they specify layout but under-constrain appearance, materials, and illumination, limiting physically meaningful edits such as relighting or material swaps and often causing temporal drift. Enriching the model with additional graphics-based modalities (intrinsics and semantics) provides complementary constraints that both disambiguate understanding and enable precise, predictable control during generation.
  However, building a single model that uses many heterogeneous cues introduces two core difficulties. Architecturally, the model must accept any subset of modalities, remain robust to missing inputs, and inject control signals without sacrificing temporal consistency. Data-wise, training demands large-scale, temporally aligned supervision that ties real videos to per-pixel multimodal annotations.
  We then propose CtrlVDiff, a unified diffusion model trained with a Hybrid Modality Control Strategy (HMCS) that routes and fuses features from depth, normals, segmentation, edges, and graphics-based intrinsics (albedo, roughness, metallic), and re-renders videos from any chosen subset with strong temporal coherence. To enable this, we build MMVideo, a hybrid real-and-synthetic dataset aligned across modalities and captions. Across understanding and generation benchmarks, CtrlVDiff delivers superior controllability and fidelity, enabling layer-wise edits (relighting, material adjustment, object insertion) and surpassing state-of-the-art baselines while remaining robust when some modalities are unavailable.

### [5] [Video Object Recognition in Mobile Edge Networks: Local Tracking or Edge Detection?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20716)
*Kun Guo,Yun Shen,Xijun Wang,Chaoqun You,Yun Rui,Tony Q. S. Quek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出LTED-Ada算法，在移动边缘计算环境中自适应选择本地跟踪或边缘检测，通过深度强化学习优化视频对象识别的帧率、准确性和延迟要求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 资源受限设备（如交通摄像头）的视频对象识别面临挑战，混合方法（边缘检测+本地跟踪）需要智能决策何时执行哪种操作。

Method: 基于深度强化学习的LTED-Ada算法，在单设备场景自适应选择策略；多设备场景使用联邦学习进行协作策略训练。

Result: 在Raspberry Pi 4B设备和PC边缘服务器上的硬件在环实验验证了LTED-Ada的优越性能。

Conclusion: LTED-Ada通过自适应决策和联邦学习协作训练，有效解决了移动边缘网络中视频对象识别的优化问题。

Abstract: Fast and accurate video object recognition, which relies on frame-by-frame video analytics, remains a challenge for resource-constrained devices such as traffic cameras. Recent advances in mobile edge computing have made it possible to offload computation-intensive object detection to edge servers equipped with high-accuracy neural networks, while lightweight and fast object tracking algorithms run locally on devices. This hybrid approach offers a promising solution but introduces a new challenge: deciding when to perform edge detection versus local tracking. To address this, we formulate two long-term optimization problems for both single-device and multi-device scenarios, taking into account the temporal correlation of consecutive frames and the dynamic conditions of mobile edge networks. Based on the formulation, we propose the LTED-Ada in single-device setting, a deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm that adaptively selects between local tracking and edge detection, according to the frame rate as well as recognition accuracy and delay requirement. In multi-device setting, we further enhance LTED-Ada using federated learning to enable collaborative policy training across devices, thereby improving its generalization to unseen frame rates and performance requirements. Finally, we conduct extensive hardware-in-the-loop experiments using multiple Raspberry Pi 4B devices and a personal computer as the edge server, demonstrating the superiority of LTED-Ada.

### [6] [DeeAD: Dynamic Early Exit of Vision-Language Action for Efficient Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20720)
*Haibo HU,Lianming Huang,Nan Guan,Chun Jason Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeeAD是一个无需训练的动作引导早期退出框架，通过评估中间轨迹的物理可行性来加速VLA规划模型，可减少28%的transformer层稀疏性和29%的推理延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA模型在自动驾驶中统一了感知、推理和轨迹生成，但由于深度transformer堆栈导致推理延迟显著。

Method: 基于物理可行性评估，当预测轨迹与轻量级规划先验（如导航或低精度规划）在可容忍偏差（<2m）内对齐时终止推理，并使用多跳控制器自适应跳过冗余层。

Result: 在Bench2Drive基准测试中实现了28%的transformer层稀疏性和29%的延迟减少，同时保持了规划质量和安全性。

Conclusion: DeeAD可以无缝集成到现有VLA模型中，无需重新训练，有效加速推理过程。

Abstract: Vision-Language Action (VLA) models unify perception, reasoning, and trajectory generation for autonomous driving, but suffer from significant inference latency due to deep transformer stacks. We present DeeAD, a training-free, action-guided early-exit framework that accelerates VLA planning by evaluating the physical feasibility of intermediate trajectories. Instead of relying on confidence scores, DeeAD terminates inference when predicted trajectories align with lightweight planning priors (e.g., Navigation or Low-precision Planning) within a tolerable deviation (<2m). To improve efficiency, we introduce a multi-hop controller that adaptively skips redundant layers based on the change rate of scores. DeeAD integrates into existing VLA models, such as ORION, without requiring retraining. Experiments on the Bench2Drive benchmark demonstrate up to 28% transformer-layer sparsity and 29% latency reduction, while preserving planning quality and safety.

### [7] [Foundry: Distilling 3D Foundation Models for the Edge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20721)
*Guillaume Letellier,Siddharth Srivastava,Frédéric Jurie,Gaurav Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Foundation Model Distillation (FMD)新范式，通过Foundry方法将大型自监督学习模型压缩为紧凑高效的代理模型，保留通用表征能力，特别针对3D点云数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型基础模型虽然功能强大，但计算成本高且难以部署在边缘设备上。现有压缩技术会牺牲模型的通用性，需要一种能保持下游任务通用性的压缩方法。

Method: 训练学生模型学习压缩的SuperTokens，重构教师模型的token级表示，捕捉其潜在空间的紧凑基向量。

Result: 单个蒸馏模型在分类、部件分割和少样本场景等多种下游任务中保持强迁移性，接近完整基础模型性能，同时显著减少token数量和FLOPs。

Conclusion: FMD范式能够创建紧凑高效的代理模型，保留基础模型的通用表征能力，使其更适合在资源受限的硬件上部署。

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained with self-supervised learning (SSL) on large-scale datasets have become powerful general-purpose feature extractors. However, their immense size and computational cost make them prohibitive for deployment on edge devices such as robots and AR/VR headsets. Existing compression techniques like standard knowledge distillation create efficient 'specialist' models but sacrifice the crucial, downstream-agnostic generality that makes foundation models so valuable.  In this paper, we introduce Foundation Model Distillation (FMD), a new paradigm for compressing large SSL models into compact, efficient, and faithful proxies that retain their general-purpose representational power. We present Foundry, the first implementation of FMD for 3D point clouds. Our approach, Foundry, trains a student to learn a compressed set of SuperTokens that reconstruct the teacher's token-level representations, capturing a compact basis of its latent space. A single distilled model maintains strong transferability across diverse downstream tasks-classification, part segmentation, and few-shot scenarios-approaching full foundation-model performance while using significantly fewer tokens and FLOPs, making such models more practical for deployment on resourceconstrained hardware.

### [8] [DinoLizer: Learning from the Best for Generative Inpainting Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20722)
*Minh Thong Doi,Jan Butora,Vincent Itier,Jérémie Boulanger,Patrick Bas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DinoLizer是基于DINOv2的生成式图像修复区域定位模型，通过线性分类头和滑动窗口策略在14×14补丁分辨率上检测语义篡改区域，在多个数据集上超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生成式图像修复中语义篡改区域的精确定位问题，利用预训练的DINOv2模型检测合成图像的能力来识别被篡改的区域。

Method: 在DINOv2模型上添加线性分类头，使用滑动窗口策略处理大尺寸图像，通过后处理优化二值化篡改掩码。

Result: 在多个修复数据集上超越最先进的局部篡改检测器，平均IoU比次优模型高12%，对常见后处理操作保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DinoLizer证明了Vision Transformers在篡改定位任务中的强大表示能力，DINOv2相比DINOv3在该任务中表现更优。

Abstract: We introduce DinoLizer, a DINOv2-based model for localizing manipulated regions in generative inpainting. Our method builds on a DINOv2 model pretrained to detect synthetic images on the B-Free dataset. We add a linear classification head on top of the Vision Transformer's patch embeddings to predict manipulations at a $14\times 14$ patch resolution. The head is trained to focus on semantically altered regions, treating non-semantic edits as part of the original content. Because the ViT accepts only fixed-size inputs, we use a sliding-window strategy to aggregate predictions over larger images; the resulting heatmaps are post-processed to refine the estimated binary manipulation masks. Empirical results show that DinoLizer surpasses state-of-the-art local manipulation detectors on a range of inpainting datasets derived from different generative models. It remains robust to common post-processing operations such as resizing, noise addition, and JPEG (double) compression. On average, DinoLizer achieves a 12\% higher Intersection-over-Union (IoU) than the next best model, with even greater gains after post-processing. Our experiments with off-the-shelf DINOv2 demonstrate the strong representational power of Vision Transformers for this task. Finally, extensive ablation studies comparing DINOv2 and its successor, DINOv3, in deepfake localization confirm DinoLizer's superiority. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.

### [9] [CANVAS: A Benchmark for Vision-Language Models on Tool-Based User Interface Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20737)
*Daeheon Jeong,Seoyeon Byun,Kihoon Son,Dae Hyun Kim,Juho Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CANVAS是一个评估视觉语言模型在工具调用下进行用户界面设计能力的基准测试，包含598个基于工具的设计任务，涵盖设计复制和设计修改两种任务类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏评估视觉语言模型在工具调用下进行UI设计性能的基准测试，无法了解这些模型在传统设计软件中与设计师协作的潜力。

Method: 从3.3K个移动UI设计中采样构建基准，包含30个功能类别的设计任务，模型通过上下文工具调用逐步更新设计，包括创建矩形作为按钮背景等操作。

Result: 领先模型展现出更策略性的工具调用，提高了设计质量，同时识别出模型常见的错误模式。

Conclusion: CANVAS基准为评估和提升基于工具的设计能力提供了指导，揭示了视觉语言模型在UI设计协作中的潜力。

Abstract: User interface (UI) design is an iterative process in which designers progressively refine their work with design software such as Figma or Sketch. Recent advances in vision language models (VLMs) with tool invocation suggest these models can operate design software to edit a UI design through iteration. Understanding and enhancing this capacity is important, as it highlights VLMs' potential to collaborate with designers within conventional software. However, as no existing benchmark evaluates tool-based design performance, the capacity remains unknown. To address this, we introduce CANVAS, a benchmark for VLMs on tool-based user interface design. Our benchmark contains 598 tool-based design tasks paired with ground-truth references sampled from 3.3K mobile UI designs across 30 function-based categories (e.g., onboarding, messaging). In each task, a VLM updates the design step-by-step through context-based tool invocations (e.g., create a rectangle as a button background), linked to design software. Specifically, CANVAS incorporates two task types: (i) design replication evaluates the ability to reproduce a whole UI screen; (ii) design modification evaluates the ability to modify a specific part of an existing screen. Results suggest that leading models exhibit more strategic tool invocations, improving design quality. Furthermore, we identify common error patterns models exhibit, guiding future work in enhancing tool-based design capabilities.

### [10] [Text-Guided Semantic Image Encoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20770)
*Raghuveer Thirukovalluru,Xiaochuang Han,Bhuwan Dhingra,Emily Dinan,Maha Elbayad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了文本引导的语义图像编码器(TIE)，通过文本查询条件化生成图像表示，在多个图像到文本基准测试中显著优于传统方法，同时提高推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉语言模型中的图像编码器通常独立预训练，无法考虑下游任务或文本查询的特定需求，导致处理图像时缺乏针对性。

Method: 开发了文本引导的语义图像编码器(TIE)，能够根据输入文本查询生成条件化的图像表示。

Result: 在1B和3B规模的九个图像到文本基准测试中，TIE分别平均提升1.5和1.3个点，在DocVQA和InfoVQA等任务上提升高达6个点，同时仅使用一半图像块(token)即可达到更好性能。

Conclusion: TIE通过文本条件化训练有效优化编码器以捕捉关键视觉特征，增强可解释性和查询特定的基础能力。

Abstract: Image encoders, a fundamental component of vision-language models (VLMs), are typically pretrained independently before being aligned with a language model. This standard paradigm results in encoders that process images agnostically, without regard to the specific downstream task or text query. To address this limitation, we propose the Text-Guided Semantic Image Encoder (TIE), which generates image representations conditioned on the input text query. VLMs equipped with TIE outperform their conventional counterparts by +1.5 and +1.3 points on average across nine image-to-text benchmarks at the 1B and 3B scales, respectively, with gains reaching up to 6 points on tasks such as DocVQA and InfoVQA. Moreover, TIE-based VLMs attain superior performance while utilizing only half as many image tiles (tokens), resulting in notably improved inference efficiency. TIE also generalizes well with generic queries, indicating that text-conditioned training effectively optimizes the encoder to capture key visual features. Qualitative analysis confirms that TIE consistently attends to query-relevant regions, enhancing both interpretability and query-specific grounding.

TL;DR: SMARC是一个从稀疏视觉输入进行表面材料重建和分类的统一模型，仅需10%的图像补丁即可重建完整RGB表面并分类材料类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖密集或全场景观测，在受限或部分视图环境中效果有限，需要解决从最小视觉输入理解材料表面的挑战。

Method: 结合部分卷积U-Net和分类头架构，在极端观测稀疏条件下实现空间修复和语义理解。

Result: 在真实世界表面纹理数据集上，SMARC达到PSNR 17.55 dB和材料分类准确率85.10%，优于其他五种模型。

Conclusion: 部分卷积在缺失数据下的空间推理具有优势，为最小视觉表面理解奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: Understanding material surfaces from sparse visual cues is critical for applications in robotics, simulation, and material perception. However, most existing methods rely on dense or full-scene observations, limiting their effectiveness in constrained or partial view environment. To address this challenge, we introduce SMARC, a unified model for Surface MAterial Reconstruction and Classification from minimal visual input. By giving only a single 10% contiguous patch of the image, SMARC recognizes and reconstructs the full RGB surface while simultaneously classifying the material category. Our architecture combines a Partial Convolutional U-Net with a classification head, enabling both spatial inpainting and semantic understanding under extreme observation sparsity. We compared SMARC against five models including convolutional autoencoders [17], Vision Transformer (ViT) [13], Masked Autoencoder (MAE) [5], Swin Transformer [9], and DETR [2] using Touch and Go dataset [16] of real-world surface textures. SMARC achieves state-of-the-art results with a PSNR of 17.55 dB and a material classification accuracy of 85.10%. Our findings highlight the advantages of partial convolution in spatial reasoning under missing data and establish a strong foundation for minimal-vision surface understanding.

TL;DR: LongVT是一个端到端的代理框架，通过交错的多模态工具链思维实现长视频推理，利用LMMs的时序定位能力作为视频裁剪工具，从全局到局部进行推理循环，直到答案基于检索到的视觉证据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型在处理长视频时容易产生幻觉，特别是当证据稀疏且时间分散时。受人类理解长视频的方式启发（先全局浏览再检查相关片段），需要开发能够进行全局到局部推理的框架。

Method: 利用LMMs固有的时序定位能力作为原生视频裁剪工具，放大特定视频片段并重新采样更细粒度的视频帧，形成全局到局部的推理循环。采用三阶段训练策略：工具集成的冷启动监督微调、代理强化学习和代理强化微调。

Result: LongVT在四个具有挑战性的长视频理解和推理基准测试中持续优于现有强基线模型。

Conclusion: LongVT框架通过多模态工具链思维和全局到局部推理循环，有效解决了长视频推理中的幻觉问题，为长视频理解任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown great potential for video reasoning with textual Chain-of-Thought. However, they remain vulnerable to hallucinations, especially when processing long-form videos where evidence is sparse and temporally dispersed. Inspired by how humans comprehend long videos - by first skimming globally and then examining relevant clips for details - we introduce LongVT, an end-to-end agentic framework that enables "Thinking with Long Videos" via interleaved Multimodal Chain-of-Tool-Thought. Specifically, we exploit LMMs' inherent temporal grounding ability as a native video cropping tool to zoom in on a specific video clip and resample finer-grained video frames. This global-to-local reasoning loop continues until answers are grounded in retrieved visual evidence. Given the scarcity of fine-grained question-answering (QA) data for the long video reasoning task, we curate and will release a data suite named VideoSIAH to facilitate both training and evaluation. Specifically, our training dataset consists of 247.9K samples for tool-integrated cold-start supervised fine-tuning, 1.6K samples for agentic reinforcement learning, and 15.4K samples for agentic reinforcement fine-tuning, respectively. Our evaluation benchmark consists of 1,280 QA pairs that are carefully curated through a semi-automatic data pipeline with human-in-the-loop validation. With a meticulously designed three-stage training strategy and extensive empirical validation, LongVT consistently outperforms existing strong baselines across four challenging long-video understanding and reasoning benchmarks. Our codes, data, and model checkpoints are publicly available at https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/LongVT .

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文对KRISP模型进行了轻量级复现，参数大幅减少但性能达到原版的75%，揭示了原模型的设计缺陷和实际问题，并在资源受限条件下评估了知识增强VQA架构的可扩展性和有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视KRISP模型，解决其工业级训练规模、计算需求大和与大型骨干网络紧密耦合的问题，提供轻量级复现版本。

Method: 通过系统消融研究进行轻量级复现，包括在合成VQA数据上的概念验证和在DAQUAR数据集上的评估，配置低参数设置并约束在外部知识图谱领域内。

Result: 复现模型性能达到原版的75%，揭示了原模型未充分覆盖的设计缺陷和实际问题，能够在边缘设备上运行并防止AI幻觉。

Conclusion: 轻量级KRISP复现模型在资源受限条件下有效，展示了知识增强VQA架构的可扩展性，适合在智能手机和AR-VR等边缘设备上进行离线视觉推理。

Abstract: Facebook AI Research introduced KRISP [4], which integrates structured external knowledge into pipelines for vision-language reasoning. Despite its effectiveness, the original model has been developed for industrial-scale training, is computationally demanding, and is tightly connected to a large backbone. In this work, we reexamine KRISP from a different angle and offer a lightweight reproduction with significantly fewer parameters. Even though our replicated model performs about 75 % of the original, the replication process uncovers a number of design flaws, real-world pitfalls, and implicit problems that were not fully covered in the original paper. We offer insights into the scalability and efficacy of knowledge-enhanced VQA architectures under resource constraints through systematic ablation studies, which include a proof-of-concept on synthetic VQA data and evaluation on the DAQUAR dataset. Our model, configured with a low parameter setup and constrained by the external Knowledge graph domain, prevents AI hallucinations and generates outputs solely within that domain. Minimal parameters allow us to function on edge devices like smartphones and AR-VR, further improving offline visual reasoning.

Abstract: Dynamic sampling mechanisms in deep learning architectures have demonstrated utility across many computer vision models, though the theoretical analysis of these structures has not yet been unified. In this paper we connect the various dynamic sampling methods by developing and analyzing a novel operator which generalizes existing methods, which we term "warping". Warping provides a minimal implementation of dynamic sampling which is amenable to analysis, and can be used to reconstruct existing architectures including deformable convolutions, active convolutional units, and spatial transformer networks. Using our formalism, we provide statistical analysis of the operator by modeling the inputs as both IID variables and homogeneous random fields. Extending this analysis, we discover a unique asymmetry between the forward and backward pass of the model training. We demonstrate that these mechanisms represent an entirely different class of orthogonal operators to the traditional translationally invariant operators defined by convolutions. With a combination of theoretical analysis and empirical investigation, we find the conditions necessary to ensure stable training of dynamic sampling networks. In addition, statistical analysis of discretization effects are studied. Finally, we introduce a novel loss landscape visualization which utilizes gradient update information directly, to better understand learning behavior.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Δ-NeRF，一种用于增量NeRF精化的模块化残差框架，通过残差控制器、不确定性感知门控机制和视图选择策略，实现在不访问过去数据的情况下进行增量学习，显著减少训练时间和数据需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NeRF框架在引入新视图时需要完全重新训练，限制了其在数据顺序到达场景（如卫星地形分析）中的应用。增量精化方法存在灾难性遗忘问题，且过去数据不可用时难以处理。

Method: 1) 残差控制器向冻结的基础NeRF注入逐层修正；2) 不确定性感知门控机制自适应结合基础和精化预测；3) 视图选择策略减少训练数据；4) 知识蒸馏将增强模型压缩为紧凑学生网络。

Result: 在卫星图像上，Δ-NeRF性能与联合训练相当，训练时间减少30-42%，数据需求减少47%。PSNR比简单微调提升43.5%，在某些指标上超越联合训练。

Conclusion: Δ-NeRF提供了一种有效的增量NeRF精化解决方案，解决了灾难性遗忘问题，显著提升了训练效率，适用于卫星地形分析等顺序数据场景。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, most existing NeRF frameworks require complete retraining when new views are introduced incrementally, limiting their applicability in domains where data arrives sequentially. This limitation is particularly problematic in satellite-based terrain analysis, where regions are repeatedly observed over time. Incremental refinement of NeRFs remains underexplored, and naive approaches suffer from catastrophic forgetting when past data is unavailable. We propose $Δ$-NeRF, a unique modular residual framework for incremental NeRF refinement. $Δ$-NeRF introduces several novel techniques including: (1) a residual controller that injects per-layer corrections into a frozen base NeRF, enabling refinement without access to past data; (2) an uncertainty-aware gating mechanism that prevents overcorrection by adaptively combining base and refined predictions; and (3) a view selection strategy that reduces training data by up to 47\% while maintaining performance. Additionally, we employ knowledge distillation to compress the enhanced model into a compact student network (20\% of original size). Experiments on satellite imagery demonstrate that $Δ$-NeRF achieves performance comparable to joint training while reducing training time by 30-42\%. $Δ$-NeRF consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving an improvement of up to 43.5\% in PSNR over naive fine-tuning and surpassing joint training on some metrics.

*Ozgur Kara,Yujia Chen,Ming-Hsuan Yang,James M. Rehg,Wen-Sheng Chu,Du Tran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Split-then-Merge (StM)框架，通过将未标注视频分割为前景和背景层并自组合来学习动态主体与场景的交互，解决生成视频合成的控制问题和数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖标注数据集或手工规则，存在数据稀缺问题。StM旨在通过无监督方式学习视频合成的复杂组合动态，增强生成视频的控制能力。

Method: 将未标注视频分割为动态前景和背景层，然后自组合学习主体与场景交互。采用变换感知训练管道，包括多层融合增强实现affordance感知组合，以及身份保持损失确保前景保真度。

Result: 在定量基准测试和人类/VLLM定性评估中，StM均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: StM框架能有效学习视频合成的组合动态，无需标注数据即可实现高质量的视频生成控制。

Abstract: We present Split-then-Merge (StM), a novel framework designed to enhance control in generative video composition and address its data scarcity problem. Unlike conventional methods relying on annotated datasets or handcrafted rules, StM splits a large corpus of unlabeled videos into dynamic foreground and background layers, then self-composes them to learn how dynamic subjects interact with diverse scenes. This process enables the model to learn the complex compositional dynamics required for realistic video generation. StM introduces a novel transformation-aware training pipeline that utilizes a multi-layer fusion and augmentation to achieve affordance-aware composition, alongside an identity-preservation loss that maintains foreground fidelity during blending. Experiments show StM outperforms SoTA methods in both quantitative benchmarks and in humans/VLLM-based qualitative evaluations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sphinx是一个针对视觉感知和推理核心认知能力的合成环境，通过程序化生成包含图案、图块、图表、图标和几何基元的谜题，并配有可验证的真实解，支持精确评估和大规模数据集构建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对当前大型视觉语言模型在视觉推理任务上的表现远低于人类水平的问题，需要构建能够精确评估核心认知能力的基准测试环境。

Method: 使用程序化生成方法创建包含25种任务类型的基准测试，涵盖对称检测、几何变换、空间推理、图表解释和序列预测等认知能力。

Result: 评估显示即使是先进的GPT-5模型在Sphinx基准上仅达到51.1%的准确率，远低于人类表现。但使用可验证奖励的强化学习（RLVR）能显著提升模型在这些任务上的准确性。

Conclusion: Sphinx基准有效暴露了当前LVLMs在视觉推理方面的局限性，而RLVR方法展示了提升多模态推理能力的潜力。

Abstract: We present Sphinx, a synthetic environment for visual perception and reasoning that targets core cognitive primitives. Sphinx procedurally generates puzzles using motifs, tiles, charts, icons, and geometric primitives, each paired with verifiable ground-truth solutions, enabling both precise evaluation and large-scale dataset construction. The benchmark covers 25 task types spanning symmetry detection, geometric transformations, spatial reasoning, chart interpretation, and sequence prediction. Evaluating recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) shows that even state-of-the-art GPT-5 attains only 51.1% accuracy, well below human performance. Finally, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) substantially improves model accuracy on these tasks and yields gains on external visual reasoning benchmarks, highlighting its promise for advancing multimodal reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练和数据的优化视觉反演方法替代传统扩散先验网络，通过优化潜在视觉表示与文本嵌入的相似度，并引入两种约束提升图像真实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战扩散模型中计算昂贵、需要大量数据训练的先验网络的必要性，寻求更轻量级的替代方案。

Method: 使用优化视觉反演方法，从随机伪令牌初始化潜在表示，通过迭代优化最大化与文本嵌入的余弦相似度，并引入马氏距离和最近邻损失约束优化过程。

Result: 在Kandinsky 2.2上的实验表明，OVI可作为传统先验的替代方案，最近邻方法在视觉保真度上表现最佳，定量得分与最先进的数据高效先验相当或更高。

Conclusion: 优化视觉反演方法具有进一步研究的价值，同时揭示了当前评估基准的缺陷，即仅使用文本嵌入作为先验就能获得高分但感知质量较低。

Abstract: Diffusion models have established the state-of-the-art in text-to-image generation, but their performance often relies on a diffusion prior network to translate text embeddings into the visual manifold for easier decoding. These priors are computationally expensive and require extensive training on massive datasets. In this work, we challenge the necessity of a trained prior at all by employing Optimization-based Visual Inversion (OVI), a training-free and data-free alternative, to replace the need for a prior. OVI initializes a latent visual representation from random pseudo-tokens and iteratively optimizes it to maximize the cosine similarity with input textual prompt embedding. We further propose two novel constraints, a Mahalanobis-based and a Nearest-Neighbor loss, to regularize the OVI optimization process toward the distribution of realistic images. Our experiments, conducted on Kandinsky 2.2, show that OVI can serve as an alternative to traditional priors. More importantly, our analysis reveals a critical flaw in current evaluation benchmarks like T2I-CompBench++, where simply using the text embedding as a prior achieves surprisingly high scores, despite lower perceptual quality. Our constrained OVI methods improve visual fidelity over this baseline, with the Nearest-Neighbor approach proving particularly effective, achieving quantitative scores comparable to or higher than the state-of-the-art data-efficient prior, indicating that the idea merits further investigation. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RefTr是一个用于血管树中心线生成的3D图像到图模型，通过循环精炼汇合轨迹来生成具有正确树状拓扑的中心线图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在临床诊断、治疗规划和手术导航中，准确检测血管树的中心线并保持高召回率至关重要，因为遗漏小分支可能导致致命错误。

Method: 采用Producer-Refiner架构，基于Transformer解码器：Producer提出初始汇合轨迹，Refiner循环精炼这些轨迹形成最终中心线图；使用汇合轨迹表示法确保有效树状拓扑；引入高效的非极大值抑制算法合并重复分支。

Result: 在多个公共中心线数据集上，RefTr实现了优于先前SOTA的召回率和相当的精度，同时推理速度更快、参数减少2.4倍。

Conclusion: RefTr展示了作为3D医学影像中血管树分析的新型最先进框架的潜力，具有高召回率、高效性和参数效率。

Abstract: Tubular trees, such as blood vessels and lung airways, are essential for material transport within the human body. Accurately detecting their centerlines with correct tree topology is critical for clinical tasks such as diagnosis, treatment planning, and surgical navigation. In these applications, maintaining high recall is crucial, as missing small branches can result in fatal mistakes caused by incomplete assessments or undetected abnormalities. We present RefTr, a 3D image-to-graph model for centerline generation of vascular trees via recurrent refinement of confluent trajectories. RefTr uses a Producer-Refiner architecture based on a Transformer decoder, where the Producer proposes a set of initial confluent trajectories that are recurrently refined by the Refiner to produce final trajectories, which forms the centerline graph. The confluent trajectory representation enables refinement of complete trajectories while explicitly enforcing a valid tree topology. The recurrent refinement scheme improves precision and reuses the same Refiner block across multiple steps, yielding a 2.4x reduction in decoder parameters compared to previous SOTA. We also introduce an efficient non-maximum suppression algorithm for spatial tree graphs to merge duplicate branches and boost precision. Across multiple public centerline datasets, RefTr achieves superior recall and comparable precision to previous SOTA, while offering faster inference and substantially fewer parameters, demonstrating its potential as a new state-of-the-art framework for vascular tree analysis in 3D medical imaging.

Abstract: Reliable depth estimation under real optical conditions remains a core challenge for camera vision in systems such as autonomous robotics and augmented reality. Despite recent progress in depth estimation and depth-of-field rendering, research remains constrained by the lack of large-scale, high-fidelity, real stereo DSLR datasets, limiting real-world generalization and evaluation of models trained on synthetic data as shown extensively in literature. We present the first high-resolution (5472$\times$3648px) stereo DSLR dataset with 18000 images, systematically varying focal length and aperture across complex real scenes and capturing the optical realism and complexity of professional camera systems. For 9 scenes with varying scene complexity, lighting and background, images are captured with two identical camera assemblies at 10 focal lengths (28-70mm) and 5 apertures (f/2.8-f/22), spanning 50 optical configurations in 2000 images per scene. This full-range optics coverage enables controlled analysis of geometric and optical effects for monocular and stereo depth estimation, shallow depth-of-field rendering, deblurring, 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Each focal configuration has a dedicated calibration image set, supporting evaluation of classical and learning based methods for intrinsic and extrinsic calibration. The dataset features challenging visual elements such as multi-scale optical illusions, reflective surfaces, mirrors, transparent glass walls, fine-grained details, and natural / artificial ambient light variations. This work attempts to bridge the realism gap between synthetic training data and real camera optics, and demonstrates challenges with the current state-of-the-art monocular, stereo depth and depth-of-field methods. We release the dataset, calibration files, and evaluation code to support reproducible research on real-world optical generalization.

Abstract: Visual content memorability has intrigued the scientific community for decades, with applications ranging widely, from understanding nuanced aspects of human memory to enhancing content design. A significant challenge in progressing the field lies in the expensive process of collecting memorability annotations from humans. This limits the diversity and scalability of datasets for modeling visual content memorability. Most existing datasets are limited to collecting aggregate memorability scores for visual content, not capturing the nuanced memorability signals present in natural, open-ended recall descriptions. In this work, we introduce the first large-scale unsupervised dataset designed explicitly for modeling visual memorability signals, containing over 82,000 videos, accompanied by descriptive recall data. We leverage tip-of-the-tongue (ToT) retrieval queries from online platforms such as Reddit. We demonstrate that our unsupervised dataset provides rich signals for two memorability-related tasks: recall generation and ToT retrieval. Large vision-language models fine-tuned on our dataset outperform state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o in generating open-ended memorability descriptions for visual content. We also employ a contrastive training strategy to create the first model capable of performing multimodal ToT retrieval. Our dataset and models present a novel direction, facilitating progress in visual content memorability research.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在雾模型参数估计方面优于现有方法，创建的SDIRF数据集为雾天视觉感知研究提供了重要资源，代码和数据集已公开以推动雾天视觉感知研究。

Abstract: We propose a method which, given a sequence of stereo foggy images, estimates the parameters of a fog model and updates them dynamically. In contrast with previous approaches, which estimate the parameters sequentially and thus are prone to error propagation, our algorithm estimates all the parameters simultaneously by solving a novel optimisation problem. By assuming that fog is only locally homogeneous, our method effectively handles real-world fog, which is often globally inhomogeneous. The proposed algorithm can be easily used as an add-on module in existing visual Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) or odometry systems in the presence of fog. In order to assess our method, we also created a new dataset, the Stereo Driving In Real Fog (SDIRF), consisting of high-quality, consecutive stereo frames of real, foggy road scenes under a variety of visibility conditions, totalling over 40 minutes and 34k frames. As a first-of-its-kind, SDIRF contains the camera's photometric parameters calibrated in a lab environment, which is a prerequisite for correctly applying the atmospheric scattering model to foggy images. The dataset also includes the counterpart clear data of the same routes recorded in overcast weather, which is useful for companion work in image defogging and depth reconstruction. We conducted extensive experiments using both synthetic foggy data and real foggy sequences from SDIRF to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over prior methods. Our method not only produces the most accurate estimates on synthetic data, but also adapts better to real fog. We make our code and SDIRF publicly available\footnote{https://github.com/SenseRoboticsLab/estimating-fog-parameters} to the community with the aim of advancing the research on visual perception in fog.

TL;DR: V^2-SAM是一个统一的跨视角物体对应框架，通过两个互补的提示生成器将SAM2从单视角分割扩展到跨视角对应，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决跨视角物体对应任务中的挑战，特别是由于视角和外观剧烈变化导致现有分割模型难以直接应用的问题。

Method: 提出两个提示生成器：基于DINOv3特征的跨视角锚点提示生成器建立几何感知对应，跨视角视觉提示生成器通过新颖的视觉提示匹配器增强外观引导线索；采用多专家设计和后验循环一致性选择器自适应选择最可靠的专家。

Result: 在Ego-Exo4D、DAVIS-2017和HANDAL-X数据集上实现了新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: V^2-SAM有效解决了跨视角物体对应问题，通过几何和外观线索的互补结合实现了鲁棒的对应性能。

Abstract: Cross-view object correspondence, exemplified by the representative task of ego-exo object correspondence, aims to establish consistent associations of the same object across different viewpoints (e.g., ego-centric and exo-centric). This task poses significant challenges due to drastic viewpoint and appearance variations, making existing segmentation models, such as SAM2, non-trivial to apply directly. To address this, we present V^2-SAM, a unified cross-view object correspondence framework that adapts SAM2 from single-view segmentation to cross-view correspondence through two complementary prompt generators. Specifically, the Cross-View Anchor Prompt Generator (V^2-Anchor), built upon DINOv3 features, establishes geometry-aware correspondences and, for the first time, unlocks coordinate-based prompting for SAM2 in cross-view scenarios, while the Cross-View Visual Prompt Generator (V^2-Visual) enhances appearance-guided cues via a novel visual prompt matcher that aligns ego-exo representations from both feature and structural perspectives. To effectively exploit the strengths of both prompts, we further adopt a multi-expert design and introduce a Post-hoc Cyclic Consistency Selector (PCCS) that adaptively selects the most reliable expert based on cyclic consistency. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of V^2-SAM, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on Ego-Exo4D (ego-exo object correspondence), DAVIS-2017 (video object tracking), and HANDAL-X (robotic-ready cross-view correspondence).

TL;DR: 提出Null-Text Test-Time Alignment (Null-TTA)方法，通过优化分类器自由引导中的无条件嵌入来对齐扩散模型，防止奖励黑客攻击，在保持跨奖励泛化的同时实现最先进的测试时对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时对齐方法容易导致目标奖励函数欠优化或过优化（奖励黑客），需要一种能确保在语义相干流形上进行对齐的方法。

Method: 优化分类器自由引导中的无条件嵌入，而不是操纵潜在或噪声变量，利用文本嵌入空间的结构化语义特性。

Result: Null-TTA实现了最先进的目标测试时对齐性能，同时保持了强大的跨奖励泛化能力。

Conclusion: 语义空间优化是测试时对齐的有效且原则性的新范式。

Abstract: Test-time alignment (TTA) aims to adapt models to specific rewards during inference. However, existing methods tend to either under-optimise or over-optimise (reward hack) the target reward function. We propose Null-Text Test-Time Alignment (Null-TTA), which aligns diffusion models by optimising the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance, rather than manipulating latent or noise variables. Due to the structured semantic nature of the text embedding space, this ensures alignment occurs on a semantically coherent manifold and prevents reward hacking (exploiting non-semantic noise patterns to improve the reward). Since the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance serves as the anchor for the model's generative distribution, Null-TTA directly steers model's generative distribution towards the target reward rather than just adjusting the samples, even without updating model parameters. Thanks to these desirable properties, we show that Null-TTA achieves state-of-the-art target test-time alignment while maintaining strong cross-reward generalisation. This establishes semantic-space optimisation as an effective and principled novel paradigm for TTA.

Result: 实现了连续图像表示、可解释几何结构和灵活局部编辑，为物理感知和交互式图像操作提供了基础

Conclusion: GaINeR框架成功解决了传统INR在几何结构和编辑能力方面的限制，为动态和交互式图像应用开辟了新途径

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have become an essential tool for modeling continuous 2D images, enabling high-fidelity reconstruction, super-resolution, and compression. Popular architectures such as SIREN, WIRE, and FINER demonstrate the potential of INR for capturing fine-grained image details. However, traditional INRs often lack explicit geometric structure and have limited capabilities for local editing or integration with physical simulation, restricting their applicability in dynamic or interactive settings. To address these limitations, we propose GaINeR: Geometry-Aware Implicit Network Representation, a novel framework for 2D images that combines trainable Gaussian distributions with a neural network-based INR. For a given image coordinate, the model retrieves the K nearest Gaussians, aggregates distance-weighted embeddings, and predicts the RGB value via a neural network. This design enables continuous image representation, interpretable geometric structure, and flexible local editing, providing a foundation for physically aware and interactive image manipulation. The official implementation of our method is publicly available at https://github.com/WJakubowska/GaINeR.

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一种深度学习模型，用于降低小脑桥脑角对比增强T1加权MRI的造影剂剂量，通过10%-30%的标准剂量即可实现良好的图像质量和诊断效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少MRI检查中造影剂的使用剂量，降低患者风险和检查成本，同时保持诊断图像质量。

Method: 采用多中心回顾性研究，使用前庭神经鞘瘤患者的T1和对比增强T1加权MRI数据，模拟低剂量对比增强图像，训练深度学习模型从低剂量图像恢复标准剂量图像质量。

Result: 深度学习模型显著提升了低剂量MRI的图像质量，在10%输入剂量下，结构相似性指数从0.639提升至0.993，峰值信噪比从21.6dB提升至41.4dB，分割性能也得到改善。

Conclusion: 深度学习模型能够显著改善小脑桥脑角低剂量MRI的图像质量，使得仅使用10%-30%标准剂量即可实现病灶检测和诊断表征。

Abstract: Objectives: To evaluate a deep learning (DL) model for reducing the agent dose of contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI (T1ce) of the cerebellopontine angle (CPA) cistern. Materials and methods: In this multi-center retrospective study, T1 and T1ce of vestibular schwannoma (VS) patients were used to simulate low-dose T1ce with varying reductions of contrast agent dose. DL models were trained to restore standard-dose T1ce from the low-dose simulation. The image quality and segmentation performance of the DL-restored T1ce were evaluated. A head and neck radiologist was asked to rate DL-restored images in multiple aspects, including image quality and diagnostic characterization. Results: 203 MRI studies from 72 VS patients (mean age, 58.51 \pm 14.73, 39 men) were evaluated. As the input dose increased, the structural similarity index measure of the restored T1ce increased from 0.639 \pm 0.113 to 0.993 \pm 0.009, and the peak signal-to-noise ratio increased from 21.6 \pm 3.73 dB to 41.4 \pm 4.84 dB. At 10% input dose, using DL-restored T1ce for segmentation improved the Dice from 0.673 to 0.734, the 95% Hausdorff distance from 2.38 mm to 2.07 mm, and the average surface distance from 1.00 mm to 0.59 mm. Both DL-restored T1ce from 10% and 30% input doses showed excellent images, with the latter being considered more informative. Conclusion: The DL model improved the image quality of low-dose MRI of the CPA cistern, which makes lesion detection and diagnostic characterization possible with 10% - 30% of the standard dose.

Abstract: We propose a smooth regularization technique that instills a strong temporal inductive bias in video recognition models, particularly benefiting lightweight architectures. Our method encourages smoothness in the intermediate-layer embeddings of consecutive frames by modeling their changes as a Gaussian Random Walk (GRW). This penalizes abrupt representational shifts, thereby promoting low-acceleration solutions that better align with the natural temporal coherence inherent in videos. By leveraging this enforced smoothness, lightweight models can more effectively capture complex temporal dynamics. Applied to such models, our technique yields a 3.8% to 6.4% accuracy improvement on Kinetics-600. Notably, the MoViNets model family trained with our smooth regularization improves the current state of the art by 3.8% to 6.1% within their respective FLOP constraints, while MobileNetV3 and the MoViNets-Stream family achieve gains of 4.9% to 6.4% over prior state-of-the-art models with comparable memory footprints.

Abstract: Neurons are the fundamental building blocks of deep neural networks, and their interconnections allow AI to achieve unprecedented results. Motivated by the goal of understanding how neurons encode information, compositional explanations leverage logical relationships between concepts to express the spatial alignment between neuron activations and human knowledge. However, these explanations rely on human-annotated datasets, restricting their applicability to specific domains and predefined concepts. This paper addresses this limitation by introducing a framework for the vision domain that allows users to probe neurons for arbitrary concepts and datasets. Specifically, the framework leverages masks generated by open vocabulary semantic segmentation to compute open vocabulary compositional explanations. The proposed framework consists of three steps: specifying arbitrary concepts, generating semantic segmentation masks using open vocabulary models, and deriving compositional explanations from these masks. The paper compares the proposed framework with previous methods for computing compositional explanations both in terms of quantitative metrics and human interpretability, analyzes the differences in explanations when shifting from human-annotated data to model-annotated data, and showcases the additional capabilities provided by the framework in terms of flexibility of the explanations with respect to the tasks and properties of interest.

Abstract: Tree-ring growth represents the annual wood increment for a tree, and quantifying it allows researchers to assess which silvicultural practices are best suited for each species. Manual measurement of this growth is time-consuming and often imprecise, as it is typically performed along 4 to 8 radial directions on a cross-sectional disc. In recent years, automated algorithms and datasets have emerged to enhance accuracy and automate the delineation of annual rings in cross-sectional images.
  To address the scarcity of wood cross-section data, we introduce the UruDendro4 dataset, a collection of 102 image samples of Pinus taeda L., each manually annotated with annual growth rings. Unlike existing public datasets, UruDendro4 includes samples extracted at multiple heights along the stem, allowing for the volumetric modeling of annual growth using manually delineated rings. This dataset (images and annotations) allows the development of volumetric models for annual wood estimation based on cross-sectional imagery.
  Additionally, we provide a performance baseline for automatic ring detection on this dataset using state-of-the-art methods. The highest performance was achieved by the DeepCS-TRD method, with a mean Average Precision of 0.838, a mean Average Recall of 0.782, and an Adapted Rand Error score of 0.084. A series of ablation experiments were conducted to empirically validate the final parameter configuration. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that training a learning model including this dataset improves the model's generalization in the tree-ring detection task.

Conclusion: 这种描述符感知的视觉模型，结合标记级和对齐损失训练，无需配对图像-报告数据即可改善自动报告指标和临床效果。

Abstract: Automated radiology report generation (RRG) for breast ultrasound (BUS) is limited by the lack of paired image-report datasets and the risk of hallucinations from large language models. We propose BUSTR, a multitask vision-language framework that generates BUS reports without requiring paired image-report supervision. BUSTR constructs reports from structured descriptors (e.g., BI-RADS, pathology, histology) and radiomics features, learns descriptor-aware visual representations with a multi-head Swin encoder trained using a multitask loss over dataset-specific descriptor sets, and aligns visual and textual tokens via a dual-level objective that combines token-level cross-entropy with a cosine-similarity alignment loss between input and output representations. We evaluate BUSTR on two public BUS datasets, BrEaST and BUS-BRA, which differ in size and available descriptors. Across both datasets, BUSTR consistently improves standard natural language generation metrics and clinical efficacy metrics, particularly for key targets such as BI-RADS category and pathology. Our results show that this descriptor-aware vision model, trained with a combined token-level and alignment loss, improves both automatic report metrics and clinical efficacy without requiring paired image-report data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像合成研究关注视觉真实性和语义合理性，但实际在线平台用户更倾向于创作艺术性、趣味性或社交参与性的内容，需要新的任务定义来反映真实创作行为

Method: 提出两阶段框架StickerNet：先确定合成类型，再预测不透明度、遮罩、位置和缩放等放置参数；基于180万真实用户编辑行为构建数据集

Result: 用户研究和定量评估显示StickerNet优于常见基线方法，与人类放置行为高度匹配，证明了从真实编辑模式学习的有效性

Conclusion: 这项工作引入了视觉理解的新方向，强调表达性和用户意图而非真实性，为创造性图像编辑提供了新思路

Abstract: As a widely used operation in image editing workflows, image composition has traditionally been studied with a focus on achieving visual realism and semantic plausibility. However, in practical editing scenarios of the modern content creation landscape, many compositions are not intended to preserve realism. Instead, users of online platforms motivated by gaining community recognition often aim to create content that is more artistic, playful, or socially engaging. Taking inspiration from this observation, we define the expressive composition task, a new formulation of image composition that embraces stylistic diversity and looser placement logic, reflecting how users edit images on real-world creative platforms. To address this underexplored problem, we present StickerNet, a two-stage framework that first determines the composition type, then predicts placement parameters such as opacity, mask, location, and scale accordingly. Unlike prior work that constructs datasets by simulating object placements on real images, we directly build our dataset from 1.8 million editing actions collected on an anonymous online visual creation and editing platform, each reflecting user-community validated placement decisions. This grounding in authentic editing behavior ensures strong alignment between task definition and training supervision. User studies and quantitative evaluations show that StickerNet outperforms common baselines and closely matches human placement behavior, demonstrating the effectiveness of learning from real-world editing patterns despite the inherent ambiguity of the task. This work introduces a new direction in visual understanding that emphasizes expressiveness and user intent over realism.

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验结果表明，TrafficLens将视频到文本转换时间减少高达4倍，同时保持信息准确性。

Conclusion: TrafficLens有效解决了多摄像头交通视频分析中的处理延迟问题，为智能交通系统提供了高效的分析工具。

Abstract: Traffic cameras are essential in urban areas, playing a crucial role in intelligent transportation systems. Multiple cameras at intersections enhance law enforcement capabilities, traffic management, and pedestrian safety. However, efficiently managing and analyzing multi-camera feeds poses challenges due to the vast amount of data. Analyzing such huge video data requires advanced analytical tools. While Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, equipped with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, excel in text-based tasks, integrating them into traffic video analysis demands converting video data into text using a Vision-Language Model (VLM), which is time-consuming and delays the timely utilization of traffic videos for generating insights and investigating incidents. To address these challenges, we propose TrafficLens, a tailored algorithm for multi-camera traffic intersections. TrafficLens employs a sequential approach, utilizing overlapping coverage areas of cameras. It iteratively applies VLMs with varying token limits, using previous outputs as prompts for subsequent cameras, enabling rapid generation of detailed textual descriptions while reducing processing time. Additionally, TrafficLens intelligently bypasses redundant VLM invocations through an object-level similarity detector. Experimental results with real-world datasets demonstrate that TrafficLens reduces video-to-text conversion time by up to $4\times$ while maintaining information accuracy.

Abstract: Collaborative machine learning across healthcare institutions promises improved diagnostic accuracy by leveraging diverse datasets, yet privacy regulations such as HIPAA prohibit direct patient data sharing. While federated learning (FL) enables decentralized training without raw data exchange, recent studies show that model gradients in conventional FL remain vulnerable to reconstruction attacks, potentially exposing sensitive medical information. This paper presents a privacy-preserving federated learning framework combining Vision Transformers (ViT) with homomorphic encryption (HE) for secure multi-institutional histopathology classification. The approach leverages the ViT CLS token as a compact 768-dimensional feature representation for secure aggregation, encrypting these tokens using CKKS homomorphic encryption before transmission to the server. We demonstrate that encrypting CLS tokens achieves a 30-fold communication reduction compared to gradient encryption while maintaining strong privacy guarantees. Through evaluation on a three-client federated setup for lung cancer histopathology classification, we show that gradients are highly susceptible to model inversion attacks (PSNR: 52.26 dB, SSIM: 0.999, NMI: 0.741), enabling near-perfect image reconstruction. In contrast, the proposed CLS-protected HE approach prevents such attacks while enabling encrypted inference directly on ciphertexts, requiring only 326 KB of encrypted data transmission per aggregation round. The framework achieves 96.12 percent global classification accuracy in the unencrypted domain and 90.02 percent in the encrypted domain.

Abstract: Style transfer, a pivotal task in image processing, synthesizes visually compelling images by seamlessly blending realistic content with artistic styles, enabling applications in photo editing and creative design. While mainstream training-free diffusion-based methods have greatly advanced style transfer in recent years, their reliance on computationally inversion processes compromises efficiency and introduces visual distortions when inversion is inaccurate. To address these limitations, we propose a novel \textit{inversion-free} style transfer framework based on dual rectified flows, which tackles the challenge of finding an unknown stylized distribution from two distinct inputs (content and style images), \textit{only with forward pass}. Our approach predicts content and style trajectories in parallel, then fuses them through a dynamic midpoint interpolation that integrates velocities from both paths while adapting to the evolving stylized image. By jointly modeling the content, style, and stylized distributions, our velocity field design achieves robust fusion and avoids the shortcomings of naive overlays. Attention injection further guides style integration, enhancing visual fidelity, content preservation, and computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate generalization across diverse styles and content, providing an effective and efficient pipeline for style transfer.

Result: 在R2C7K基准测试上进行了广泛实验，与现有最先进方法相比表现出竞争性或更优的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为Ref-COD提供了一种简单高效的路径，无需强制性的测试时参考图像。

Abstract: Referring Camouflaged Object Detection (Ref-COD) segments specified camouflaged objects in a scene by leveraging a small set of referring images. Though effective, current systems adopt a dual-branch design that requires reference images at test time, which limits deployability and adds latency and data-collection burden. We introduce a Ref-COD framework that distills references into a class-prototype memory during training and synthesizes a reference vector at inference via a query-conditioned mixture of prototypes. Concretely, we maintain an EMA-updated prototype per category and predict mixture weights from the query to produce a guidance vector without any test-time references. To bridge the representation gap between reference statistics and camouflaged query features, we propose a bidirectional attention alignment module that adapts both the query features and the class representation. Thus, our approach yields a simple, efficient path to Ref-COD without mandatory references. We evaluate the proposed method on the large-scale R2C7K benchmark. Extensive experiments demonstrate competitive or superior performance of the proposed method compared with recent state-of-the-arts. Code is available at https://github.com/yuhuan-wu/RefOnce.

Abstract: Accurately localizing and segmenting obscured objects from faint light patterns beyond the field of view is highly challenging due to multiple scattering and medium-induced perturbations. Most existing methods, based on real-valued modeling or local convolutional operations, are inadequate for capturing the underlying physics of coherent light propagation. Moreover, under low signal-to-noise conditions, these methods often converge to non-physical solutions, severely compromising the stability and reliability of the observation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel physics-driven Wavefront Propagating Compensation Network (WavePCNet) to simulate wavefront propagation and enhance the perception of obscured objects. This WavePCNet integrates the Tri-Phase Wavefront Complex-Propagation Reprojection (TriWCP) to incorporate complex amplitude transfer operators to precisely constrain coherent propagation behavior, along with a momentum memory mechanism to effectively suppress the accumulation of perturbations. Additionally, a High-frequency Cross-layer Compensation Enhancement is introduced to construct frequency-selective pathways with multi-scale receptive fields and dynamically model structural consistency across layers, further boosting the model's robustness and interpretability under complex environmental conditions. Extensive experiments conducted on four physically collected datasets demonstrate that WavePCNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across both accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) are increasingly deployed for vision-language tasks that produce explicit intermediate rationales. However, reasoning traces can contain unsafe content even when the final answer is non-harmful, creating deployment risks. Existing multimodal safety guards primarily evaluate only the input question and the final answer, neglecting the intermediate reasoning process. This oversight allows undetected harm, such as biased inferences or policy-violating use of visual context, to emerge during reasoning. We introduce GuardTrace-VL, a vision-aware safety auditor that monitors the full Question-Thinking-Answer (QTA) pipeline via joint image-text analysis, enabling detection of unsafe content as it emerges in the reasoning stage. To support training and evaluation, we construct the GuardTrace dataset, which is generated through diverse prompting strategies and refined via a MLRM- and human-based voting and verification pipeline. Furthermore, we propose a three-stage progressive training scheme combined with the data refinement process, enabling the model to learn nuanced and context-dependent safety preferences according to different risk levels. On our proposed test set covering both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, GuardTrace-VL model achieves an F1 score of 93.1% on unsafe reasoning detection tasks, representing a 13.5% improvement in F1 score compared to the previous strongest multimodal safety defense methods. The codes will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Images can be viewed as layered compositions, foreground objects over background, with potential occlusions. This layered representation enables independent editing of elements, offering greater flexibility for content creation. Despite the progress in large generative models, decomposing a single image into layers remains challenging due to limited methods and data. We observe a strong connection between layer decomposition and in/outpainting tasks, and propose adapting a diffusion-based inpainting model for layer decomposition using lightweight finetuning. To further preserve detail in the latent space, we introduce a novel multi-modal context fusion module with linear attention complexity. Our model is trained purely on a synthetic dataset constructed from open-source assets and achieves superior performance in object removal and occlusion recovery, unlocking new possibilities in downstream editing and creative applications.

Abstract: News image captioning aims to produce journalistically informative descriptions by combining visual content with contextual cues from associated articles. Despite recent advances, existing methods struggle with three key challenges: (1) incomplete information coverage, (2) weak cross-modal alignment, and (3) suboptimal visual-entity grounding. To address these issues, we introduce MERGE, the first Multimodal Entity-aware Retrieval-augmented GEneration framework for news image captioning. MERGE constructs an entity-centric multimodal knowledge base (EMKB) that integrates textual, visual, and structured knowledge, enabling enriched background retrieval. It improves cross-modal alignment through a multistage hypothesis-caption strategy and enhances visual-entity matching via dynamic retrieval guided by image content. Extensive experiments on GoodNews and NYTimes800k show that MERGE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with CIDEr gains of +6.84 and +1.16 in caption quality, and F1-score improvements of +4.14 and +2.64 in named entity recognition. Notably, MERGE also generalizes well to the unseen Visual News dataset, achieving +20.17 in CIDEr and +6.22 in F1-score, demonstrating strong robustness and domain adaptability.

Motivation: 现有的模型迁移性评估指标选择方法通常是临时性的或仅基于指标的历史平均性能，但实际效果高度依赖于具体任务，没有一个指标在所有数据集上都是最优的。

Method: 将指标选择建模为学习排序问题，使用预训练语言模型编码数据集和指标的文本描述，在共享语义空间中嵌入，通过元预测器离线学习数据集特征与指标机制之间的复杂关系。

Conclusion: MetaRank能够基于新目标数据集的文本描述高效地对候选MTE指标进行排序，使实践者能够先验地选择最合适的指标。

Abstract: Selecting an appropriate pre-trained source model is a critical, yet computationally expensive, task in transfer learning. Model Transferability Estimation (MTE) methods address this by providing efficient proxy metrics to rank models without full fine-tuning. In practice, the choice of which MTE metric to use is often ad hoc or guided simply by a metric's average historical performance. However, we observe that the effectiveness of MTE metrics is highly task-dependent and no single metric is universally optimal across all target datasets. To address this gap, we introduce MetaRank, a meta-learning framework for automatic, task-aware MTE metric selection. We formulate metric selection as a learning-to-rank problem. Rather than relying on conventional meta-features, MetaRank encodes textual descriptions of both datasets and MTE metrics using a pretrained language model, embedding them into a shared semantic space. A meta-predictor is then trained offline on diverse meta-tasks to learn the intricate relationship between dataset characteristics and metric mechanisms, optimized with a listwise objective that prioritizes correctly ranking the top-performing metrics. During the subsequent online phase, MetaRank efficiently ranks the candidate MTE metrics for a new, unseen target dataset based on its textual description, enabling practitioners to select the most appropriate metric a priori.

Abstract: Trustworthy multi-view classification (TMVC) addresses the challenge of achieving reliable decision-making in complex scenarios where multi-source information is heterogeneous, inconsistent, or even conflicting. Existing TMVC approaches predominantly rely on globally dense neighbor relationships to model intra-view dependencies, leading to high computational costs and an inability to directly ensure consistency across inter-view relationships. Furthermore, these methods typically aggregate evidence from different views through manually assigned weights, lacking guarantees that the learned multi-view neighbor structures are consistent within the class space, thus undermining the trustworthiness of classification outcomes. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel TMVC framework that introduces prototypes to represent the neighbor structures of each view. By simplifying the learning of intra-view neighbor relations and enabling dynamic alignment of intra- and inter-view structure, our approach facilitates more efficient and consistent discovery of cross-view consensus. Extensive experiments on multiple public multi-view datasets demonstrate that our method achieves competitive downstream performance and robustness compared to prevalent TMVC methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CameraMaster是一个统一的相机感知框架，通过解耦相机指令和参数嵌入来实现精确的图像修饰控制，解决了现有方法在参数控制和可扩展性方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本引导扩散模型在图像编辑中存在两个主要问题：一是仅依赖模糊的文本提示难以实现精确的相机参数控制；二是为每个参数训练独立模块导致可扩展性差、多参数组合困难以及对细微变化不敏感。

Method: CameraMaster通过显式解耦相机指令，整合两个关键信息流：捕捉摄影师意图的指令表示和编码精确相机设置的参数嵌入。使用相机参数嵌入调制相机指令和内容语义，通过交叉注意力将调制后的指令注入内容特征，同时在去噪过程中将指令和相机嵌入作为条件和门控信号。

Result: 在包含78K图像-提示对的大规模数据集上训练和评估，CameraMaster对参数变化产生单调且接近线性的响应，支持无缝的多参数组合，并显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CameraMaster通过统一的相机感知框架实现了精确的图像修饰控制，在参数敏感性、多参数组合和性能方面都表现出色。

Abstract: Text-guided diffusion models have greatly advanced image editing and generation. However, achieving physically consistent image retouching with precise parameter control (e.g., exposure, white balance, zoom) remains challenging. Existing methods either rely solely on ambiguous and entangled text prompts, which hinders precise camera control, or train separate heads/weights for parameter adjustment, which compromises scalability, multi-parameter composition, and sensitivity to subtle variations. To address these limitations, we propose CameraMaster, a unified camera-aware framework for image retouching. The key idea is to explicitly decouple the camera directive and then coherently integrate two critical information streams: a directive representation that captures the photographer's intent, and a parameter embedding that encodes precise camera settings. CameraMaster first uses the camera parameter embedding to modulate both the camera directive and the content semantics. The modulated directive is then injected into the content features via cross-attention, yielding a strongly camera-sensitive semantic context. In addition, the directive and camera embeddings are injected as conditioning and gating signals into the time embedding, enabling unified, layer-wise modulation throughout the denoising process and enforcing tight semantic-parameter alignment. To train and evaluate CameraMaster, we construct a large-scale dataset of 78K image-prompt pairs annotated with camera parameters. Extensive experiments show that CameraMaster produces monotonic and near-linear responses to parameter variations, supports seamless multi-parameter composition, and significantly outperforms existing methods.

TL;DR: 提出了CaptionQA基准测试，通过下游任务效用评估图像描述质量，发现当前模型生成的描述在替代图像完成任务时存在显著效用差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估方法未能回答一个基本问题：描述能否在实际下游任务中替代图像？需要基于效用的评估基准来衡量描述质量。

Method: 构建包含4个领域、25个顶级类别和69个子类别的密集标注多选问题集（33,027个问题），通过LLM仅使用描述回答问题来直接测量描述效用。

Result: 评估显示图像与其描述之间存在显著效用差距，在传统图像问答基准上表现相近的模型，在描述效用上最多下降32%。

Conclusion: CaptionQA基准揭示了当前图像描述在替代视觉内容方面的局限性，为改进描述生成模型提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Image captions serve as efficient surrogates for visual content in multimodal systems such as retrieval, recommendation, and multi-step agentic inference pipelines. Yet current evaluation practices miss a fundamental question: Can captions stand-in for images in real downstream tasks? We propose a utility-based benchmark, CaptionQA, to evaluate model-generated captions, where caption quality is measured by how well it supports downstream tasks. CaptionQA is an extensible domain-dependent benchmark covering 4 domains--Natural, Document, E-commerce, and Embodied AI--each with fine-grained taxonomies (25 top-level and 69 subcategories) that identify useful information for domain-specific tasks. CaptionQA builds 33,027 densely annotated multiple-choice questions (50.3 per image on average) that explicitly require visual information to answer, providing a comprehensive probe of caption utility. In our evaluation protocol, an LLM answers these questions using captions alone, directly measuring whether captions preserve image-level utility and are utilizable by a downstream LLM. Evaluating state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals substantial gaps between the image and its caption utility. Notably, models nearly identical on traditional image-QA benchmarks lower by up to 32% in caption utility. We release CaptionQA along with an open-source pipeline for extension to new domains. The code is available at https://github.com/bronyayang/CaptionQA.

Motivation: 现有音乐到舞蹈生成方法的生成效率有限，无法为高保真3D渲染提供足够的计算余量，限制了3D角色在真实应用中的表现力。

Method: 结合MeanFlow与物理一致性约束实现高质量动作生成；采用基于BiMamba的骨干网络和通道级跨模态融合的简单高效架构；支持非自回归生成方式；提供动作编辑功能。

Result: 在AIST++和FineDance数据集上的实验表明，FlowerDance在动作质量和生成效率方面均达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: FlowerDance不仅能够生成具有物理合理性和艺术表现力的精细动作，还在推理速度和内存利用方面实现了显著的生成效率提升。

Abstract: Music-to-dance generation aims to translate auditory signals into expressive human motion, with broad applications in virtual reality, choreography, and digital entertainment. Despite promising progress, the limited generation efficiency of existing methods leaves insufficient computational headroom for high-fidelity 3D rendering, thereby constraining the expressiveness of 3D characters during real-world applications. Thus, we propose FlowerDance, which not only generates refined motion with physical plausibility and artistic expressiveness, but also achieves significant generation efficiency on inference speed and memory utilization . Specifically, FlowerDance combines MeanFlow with Physical Consistency Constraints, which enables high-quality motion generation with only a few sampling steps. Moreover, FlowerDance leverages a simple but efficient model architecture with BiMamba-based backbone and Channel-Level Cross-Modal Fusion, which generates dance with efficient non-autoregressive manner. Meanwhile, FlowerDance supports motion editing, enabling users to interactively refine dance sequences. Extensive experiments on AIST++ and FineDance show that FlowerDance achieves state-of-the-art results in both motion quality and generation efficiency. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Conclusion: 区域级语义对齐和多智能体协作在结节诊断中至关重要，LungNoduleAgent是支持临床肺部结节分析的有前景的基础工具。

Abstract: Diagnosing lung cancer typically involves physicians identifying lung nodules in Computed tomography (CT) scans and generating diagnostic reports based on their morphological features and medical expertise. Although advancements have been made in using multimodal large language models for analyzing lung CT scans, challenges remain in accurately describing nodule morphology and incorporating medical expertise. These limitations affect the reliability and effectiveness of these models in clinical settings. Collaborative multi-agent systems offer a promising strategy for achieving a balance between generality and precision in medical applications, yet their potential in pathology has not been thoroughly explored. To bridge these gaps, we introduce LungNoduleAgent, an innovative collaborative multi-agent system specifically designed for analyzing lung CT scans. LungNoduleAgent streamlines the diagnostic process into sequential components, improving precision in describing nodules and grading malignancy through three primary modules. The first module, the Nodule Spotter, coordinates clinical detection models to accurately identify nodules. The second module, the Radiologist, integrates localized image description techniques to produce comprehensive CT reports. Finally, the Doctor Agent System performs malignancy reasoning by using images and CT reports, supported by a pathology knowledge base and a multi-agent system framework. Extensive testing on two private datasets and the public LIDC-IDRI dataset indicates that LungNoduleAgent surpasses mainstream vision-language models, agent systems, and advanced expert models. These results highlight the importance of region-level semantic alignment and multi-agent collaboration in diagnosing nodules. LungNoduleAgent stands out as a promising foundational tool for supporting clinical analyses of lung nodules.

Conclusion: 该框架通过将生成先验与密集物理约束相结合，成功解决了空间变化图像去模糊的根本病态问题，在保持物理准确性的同时实现了优越的感知质量。

Abstract: Spatially varying image deblurring remains a fundamentally ill-posed problem, especially when degradations arise from complex mixtures of motion and other forms of blur under significant noise. State-of-the-art learning-based approaches generally fall into two paradigms: model-based deep unrolling methods that enforce physical constraints by modeling the degradations, but often produce over-smoothed, artifact-laden textures, and generative models that achieve superior perceptual quality yet hallucinate details due to weak physical constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that uniquely reconciles these paradigms by taming a powerful generative prior with explicit, dense physical constraints. Rather than oversimplifying the degradation field, we model it as a dense continuum of high-dimensional compressed kernels, ensuring that minute variations in motion and other degradation patterns are captured. We leverage this rich descriptor field to condition a ControlNet architecture, strongly guiding the diffusion sampling process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively bridges the gap between physical accuracy and perceptual realism, outperforming state-of-the-art model-based methods as well as generative baselines in challenging, severely blurred scenarios.

Motivation: 当前图像情感合成方法将生成和编辑任务人为分离，造成效率低下，限制了在治疗干预、故事叙述等自然交织任务中的应用。

Method: 采用概念上对齐测试时缩放策略，利用现成情感分类器进行基于梯度的情感token优化，通过语义相似度确定最佳引导时机，使用多情感损失减少固有和相似情感的干扰。

Result: 实验结果显示MUSE在生成和编辑任务上均优于所有方法，提高了情感准确性和语义多样性，同时在期望内容、文本提示遵循和真实情感表达之间保持最佳平衡。

Conclusion: MUSE为情感合成建立了新范式，实现了统一的情感生成和编辑框架。

Abstract: Images evoke emotions that profoundly influence perception, often prioritized over content. Current Image Emotional Synthesis (IES) approaches artificially separate generation and editing tasks, creating inefficiencies and limiting applications where these tasks naturally intertwine, such as therapeutic interventions or storytelling. In this work, we introduce MUSE, the first unified framework capable of both emotional generation and editing. By adopting a strategy conceptually aligned with Test-Time Scaling (TTS) that widely used in both LLM and diffusion model communities, it avoids the requirement for additional updating diffusion model and specialized emotional synthesis datasets. More specifically, MUSE addresses three key questions in emotional synthesis: (1) HOW to stably guide synthesis by leveraging an off-the-shelf emotion classifier with gradient-based optimization of emotional tokens; (2) WHEN to introduce emotional guidance by identifying the optimal timing using semantic similarity as a supervisory signal; and (3) WHICH emotion to guide synthesis through a multi-emotion loss that reduces interference from inherent and similar emotions. Experimental results show that MUSE performs favorably against all methods for both generation and editing, improving emotional accuracy and semantic diversity while maintaining an optimal balance between desired content, adherence to text prompts, and realistic emotional expression. It establishes a new paradigm for emotion synthesis.

Conclusion: T-NIG模型能够在不规则时间数据分布下，有效生成长期预测图像并保持疾病特征，为AD诊断提供可靠的成像依据。

Abstract: Image generation can provide physicians with an imaging diagnosis basis in the prediction of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Recent research has shown that long-term AD predictions by image generation often face difficulties maintaining disease-related characteristics when dealing with irregular time intervals in sequential data. Considering that the time-related aspects of the distribution can reflect changes in disease-related characteristics when images are distributed unevenly, this research proposes a model to estimate the temporal parameter within the Normal Inverse Gamma Distribution (T-NIG) to assist in generating images over the long term. The T-NIG model employs brain images from two different time points to create intermediate brain images, forecast future images, and predict the disease. T-NIG is designed by identifying features using coordinate neighborhoods. It incorporates a time parameter into the normal inverse gamma distribution to understand how features change in brain imaging sequences that have varying time intervals. Additionally, T-NIG utilizes uncertainty estimation to reduce both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties in the model, which arise from insufficient temporal data. In particular, the T-NIG model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in both short-term and long-term prediction tasks within the dataset. Experimental results indicate that T-NIG is proficient in forecasting disease progression while maintaining disease-related characteristics, even when faced with an irregular temporal data distribution.

Motivation: 扩散基编辑模型难以准确解释复杂的用户指令，特别是涉及组合关系、上下文线索或指代表达的指令，导致编辑结果语义漂移或无法反映预期变化。

Method: 提出MIRA多模态推理代理，采用迭代感知-推理-行动循环，逐步预测原子编辑指令，利用视觉反馈进行决策。使用150K多模态工具使用数据集MIRA-Editing和两阶段SFT + GRPO训练流程。

Result: 当与开源图像编辑模型（如Flux.1-Kontext、Step1X-Edit、Qwen-Image-Edit）配对时，MIRA显著提高了语义一致性和感知质量，性能达到或超过GPT-Image和Nano-Banana等专有系统。

Conclusion: MIRA通过模拟多轮人机交互过程，有效解决了复杂指令下的图像编辑问题，为指令引导的图像编辑提供了更准确和可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Instruction-guided image editing offers an intuitive way for users to edit images with natural language. However, diffusion-based editing models often struggle to accurately interpret complex user instructions, especially those involving compositional relationships, contextual cues, or referring expressions, leading to edits that drift semantically or fail to reflect the intended changes. We tackle this problem by proposing MIRA (Multimodal Iterative Reasoning Agent), a lightweight, plug-and-play multimodal reasoning agent that performs editing through an iterative perception-reasoning-action loop, effectively simulating multi-turn human-model interaction processes. Instead of issuing a single prompt or static plan, MIRA predicts atomic edit instructions step by step, using visual feedback to make its decisions. Our 150K multimodal tool-use dataset, MIRA-Editing, combined with a two-stage SFT + GRPO training pipeline, enables MIRA to perform reasoning and editing over complex editing instructions. When paired with open-source image editing models such as Flux.1-Kontext, Step1X-Edit, and Qwen-Image-Edit, MIRA significantly improves both semantic consistency and perceptual quality, achieving performance comparable to or exceeding proprietary systems such as GPT-Image and Nano-Banana.

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过学习时空特征表示，显著提升了虹膜认证系统在复杂环境下的鲁棒性和判别能力。

Abstract: Iris authentication algorithms have achieved impressive recognition performance, making them highly promising for real-world applications such as border control, citizen identification, and both criminal investigations and commercial systems. However, their robustness is still challenged by variations in rotation, scale, specular reflections, and defocus blur. In addition, most existing approaches rely on straightforward point-to-point comparisons, typically using cosine or L2 distance, without effectively leveraging the spatio-spatial-temporal structure of iris patterns. To address these limitations, we propose a novel and generalized matching pipeline that learns rich spatio-spatial-temporal representations of iris features. Our approach first splits each iris image along one dimension, generating a sequence of sub-images that serve as input to a 3D-CNN, enabling the network to capture both spatial and spatio-spatial-temporal cues. To further enhance the modeling of spatio-spatial-temporal feature dynamics, we train the model in curriculum manner. This design allows the network to embed temporal dependencies directly into the feature space, improving discriminability in the deep metric domain. The framework is trained end-to-end with triplet and ArcFace loss in a curriculum manner, enforcing highly discriminative embeddings despite challenges like rotation, scale, reflections, and blur. This design yields a robust and generalizable solution for iris authentication.Github code: https://github.com/GeetanjaliGTZ/CLRecogEye

Abstract: Radar sensors provide reliable perception across adverse weather, lighting, and long-range conditions. Recent advances in foundation models have transformed visual and language understanding, yet their integration with radar sensing remains largely underexplored. Existing radar approaches are fragmented and task-specific; each downstream task employs distinct architectures and training objectives, preventing transfer across tasks. In this work, we introduce RadarFM: a radar foundation model that learns unified scene-level representations through structured spatial language supervision. We make two key contributions: (1) a structured caption framework that encodes vehicle distributions in native radar coordinates, and (2) a hash-aware contrastive learning objective that quantifies continuous scene similarity rather than binary matching, enabling fine-grained spatial reasoning. Leveraging the CARLA simulator, we generate large-scale, well-annotated radar datasets across diverse driving scenarios. We also propose localization-aware metrics that assess spatial accuracy beyond traditional detection measures.

Conclusion: EM-KD通过有效对齐视觉token和双重蒸馏策略，显著提升了高效MLLMs的理解能力，在保持效率的同时实现了更好的性能。

Abstract: Efficient Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) compress vision tokens to reduce resource consumption, but the loss of visual information can degrade comprehension capabilities. Although some priors introduce Knowledge Distillation to enhance student models, they overlook the fundamental differences in fine-grained vision comprehension caused by unbalanced vision tokens between the efficient student and vanilla teacher. In this paper, we propose EM-KD, a novel paradigm that enhances the Efficient MLLMs with Knowledge Distillation. To overcome the challenge of unbalanced vision tokens, we first calculate the Manhattan distance between the vision logits of teacher and student, and then align them in the spatial dimension with the Hungarian matching algorithm. After alignment, EM-KD introduces two distillation strategies: 1) Vision-Language Affinity Distillation (VLAD) and 2) Vision Semantic Distillation (VSD). Specifically, VLAD calculates the affinity matrix between text tokens and aligned vision tokens, and minimizes the smooth L1 distance of the student and the teacher affinity matrices. Considering the semantic richness of vision logits in the final layer, VSD employs the reverse KL divergence to measure the discrete probability distributions of the aligned vision logits over the vocabulary space. Comprehensive evaluation on diverse benchmarks demonstrates that EM-KD trained model outperforms prior Efficient MLLMs on both accuracy and efficiency with a large margin, validating its effectiveness. Compared with previous distillation methods, which are equipped with our proposed vision token matching strategy for fair comparison, EM-KD also achieves better performance.

TL;DR: FaithFusion是一个基于像素级期望信息增益的3DGS-扩散模型融合框架，用于可控驾驶场景重建和3D场景生成，在保持几何保真度的同时实现大视角变化下的视觉合理外观合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在可控驾驶场景重建和3D场景生成中，需要在保持几何保真度的同时，在大视角变化下合成视觉合理的外观。然而，几何驱动的3DGS和外观驱动的扩散模型的有效融合面临挑战，缺乏像素级、3D一致的编辑标准会导致过度修复和几何漂移。

Method: 提出FaithFusion框架，使用像素级期望信息增益作为统一策略进行连贯的时空合成：EIG作为空间先验指导扩散模型优化高不确定性区域，同时通过像素级权重将编辑结果蒸馏回3DGS。这是一个即插即用的系统，无需额外先验条件和结构修改。

Conclusion: FaithFusion通过像素级期望信息增益有效解决了3DGS和扩散模型融合中的几何漂移和过度修复问题，实现了高质量的可控驾驶场景重建和生成。

Abstract: In controllable driving-scene reconstruction and 3D scene generation, maintaining geometric fidelity while synthesizing visually plausible appearance under large viewpoint shifts is crucial. However, effective fusion of geometry-based 3DGS and appearance-driven diffusion models faces inherent challenges, as the absence of pixel-wise, 3D-consistent editing criteria often leads to over-restoration and geometric drift. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{FaithFusion}, a 3DGS-diffusion fusion framework driven by pixel-wise Expected Information Gain (EIG). EIG acts as a unified policy for coherent spatio-temporal synthesis: it guides diffusion as a spatial prior to refine high-uncertainty regions, while its pixel-level weighting distills the edits back into 3DGS. The resulting plug-and-play system is free from extra prior conditions and structural modifications.Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that our approach attains SOTA performance across NTA-IoU, NTL-IoU, and FID, maintaining an FID of 107.47 even at 6 meters lane shift.

Method: AnchorOPT在锚点值和位置关系两个维度引入动态性：从任务特定数据动态学习锚点值，通过可学习位置矩阵自适应优化锚点与软标记的位置关系。采用两阶段训练策略。

Result: 仅使用简单可学习锚点和位置矩阵，性能即可达到或超过一些包含额外可学习模块或正则化技术的方法。作为即插即用模块，在多个数据集上带来一致性能提升。

Conclusion: AnchorOPT通过动态锚点机制有效提升了提示学习的灵活性和性能，为CLIP模型提供了更好的跨任务泛化能力。

Abstract: Existing prompt learning methods, which are built upon CLIP models, leverage textual tokens as anchors to guide the learnable soft tokens. This guidance improves CLIP generalizations. However, these anchors-static in both value and position-lack cross-task and stage-adaptive flexibility. To address this limitation, we propose AnchorOPT, a dynamic anchor-based prompt learning framework. Specifically, AnchorOPT introduces dynamism in two key dimensions: (i) anchor values eschew handcrafted explicit textual tokens (e.g., "shape", "color"), instead learning dynamically from task-specific data; and (ii) the positional relationship between anchor and soft tokens is no longer fixed but adaptively optimized via a learnable position matrix conditioned on the training stage and task context. Training occurs in two stages: we first learn the anchor tokens, then freeze and transfer them to the second stage for optimization of soft tokens and the position matrix. Extensive experiments demonstrate that using only a simple learnable anchor and position matrix achieves performance comparable to or exceeding some methods incorporating additional learnable modules or regularization techniques. As a plug-and-play module, AnchorOPT integrates seamlessly into existing frameworks, yielding consistent performance gains across diverse datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为变形感知时序生成网络（DATGN）的新方法，用于自动学习脑部图像中与疾病进展相关的形态变化，以实现阿尔茨海默病的早期预测。该方法能处理MRI图像序列中的缺失数据，生成符合疾病进展的未来MRI图像，并在ADNI数据集上取得了竞争性的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病（AD）是一种退行性脑部疾病，早期预测有助于延缓其进展。目前预测方法主要依赖手动特征提取来分析脑部图像的形态变化，这需要自动化解决方案。此外，MRI图像时间序列中常见数据缺失问题，需要有效的插值方法。

Method: DATGN首先对不完整的时序序列进行插值，然后通过双向时序变形感知模块指导网络生成符合疾病进展的未来MRI图像。该方法能够自动学习脑部形态变化模式，用于阿尔茨海默病的早期预测。

Result: 在ADNI数据集上测试显示，DATGN在PSNR和MMSE图像质量指标上具有竞争力。将DATGN生成的合成数据集成到SVM、CNN和3DCNN分类方法中，AD vs NC分类准确率提高了6.21%到16%，AD vs MCI vs NC分类准确率提高了7.34%到21.25%。定性可视化结果表明DATGN生成的MRI图像符合阿尔茨海默病脑萎缩趋势。

Conclusion: DATGN能够有效生成符合阿尔茨海默病进展趋势的MRI图像，为疾病早期预测提供了有前景的解决方案。该方法在图像质量和分类性能方面都表现出显著优势，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD), a degenerative brain condition, can benefit from early prediction to slow its progression. As the disease progresses, patients typically undergo brain atrophy. Current prediction methods for Alzheimers disease largely involve analyzing morphological changes in brain images through manual feature extraction. This paper proposes a novel method, the Deformation-Aware Temporal Generative Network (DATGN), to automate the learning of morphological changes in brain images about disease progression for early prediction. Given the common occurrence of missing data in the temporal sequences of MRI images, DATGN initially interpolates incomplete sequences. Subsequently, a bidirectional temporal deformation-aware module guides the network in generating future MRI images that adhere to the disease's progression, facilitating early prediction of Alzheimer's disease. DATGN was tested for the generation of temporal sequences of future MRI images using the ADNI dataset, and the experimental results are competitive in terms of PSNR and MMSE image quality metrics. Furthermore, when DATGN-generated synthetic data was integrated into the SVM vs. CNN vs. 3DCNN-based classification methods, significant improvements were achieved from 6. 21\% to 16\% in AD vs. NC classification accuracy and from 7. 34\% to 21. 25\% in AD vs. MCI vs. NC classification accuracy. The qualitative visualization results indicate that DATGN produces MRI images consistent with the brain atrophy trend in Alzheimer's disease, enabling early disease prediction.

Motivation: 大规模视觉生成模型在迁移到下游任务时存在显著的参数冗余问题，需要一种专门针对生成模型特点的剪枝方法，既能减少参数又能保持输出的多样性和条件保真度。

Method: 提出熵指导剪枝策略，使用数据依赖的条件熵偏差(CED)作为模块重要性评估指标；设计零样本自适应剪枝框架，动态决定何时剪枝和剪枝多少，避免一次性剪枝导致的模式崩溃问题。

Conclusion: EntPruner为生成模型提供了一种有效的剪枝解决方案，能够在保持生成质量的同时显著提升推理效率，解决了生成模型在下游任务中的参数冗余问题。

Abstract: Large-scale vision generative models, including diffusion and flow models, have demonstrated remarkable performance in visual generation tasks. However, transferring these pre-trained models to downstream tasks often results in significant parameter redundancy. In this paper, we propose EntPruner, an entropy-guided automatic progressive pruning framework for diffusion and flow models. First, we introduce entropy-guided pruning, a block-level importance assessment strategy specifically designed for generative models. Unlike discriminative models, generative models require preserving the diversity and condition-fidelity of the output distribution. As the importance of each module can vary significantly across downstream tasks, EntPruner prioritizes pruning of less important blocks using data-dependent Conditional Entropy Deviation (CED) as a guiding metric. CED quantifies how much the distribution diverges from the learned conditional data distribution after removing a block. Second, we propose a zero-shot adaptive pruning framework to automatically determine when and how much to prune during training. This dynamic strategy avoids the pitfalls of one-shot pruning, mitigating mode collapse, and preserving model performance. Extensive experiments on DiT and SiT models demonstrate the effectiveness of EntPruner, achieving up to 2.22$\times$ inference speedup while maintaining competitive generation quality on ImageNet and three downstream datasets.

Method: 构建了Idis数据集，系统地在语义、数值和空间维度上变化视觉干扰项，并通过分析推理轨迹中的属性计数来研究干扰项、推理长度和准确性之间的相互作用。

Result: 视觉干扰项与文本干扰项存在根本差异：虽然都存在逆扩展效应，但视觉干扰项会降低准确性而不增加推理长度。属性计数跟踪提供了干扰项影响机制的关键洞察。

Conclusion: 视觉干扰项对视觉语言模型的影响机制与文本干扰项不同，提出的简单提示策略可以有效减轻推理模型中的偏见驱动预测。

Abstract: How does irrelevant information (i.e., distractors) affect test-time scaling in vision-language models (VLMs)? Prior studies on language models have reported an inverse scaling effect, where textual distractors lead to longer but less effective reasoning. To investigate whether similar phenomena occur in multimodal settings, we introduce Idis (Images with distractors), a visual question-answering dataset that systematically varies distractors along semantic, numerical, and spatial dimensions. Our analyses reveal that visual distractors differ fundamentally from textual ones: although inverse scaling persists, adding visual distractors reduces accuracy without increasing reasoning length. We further show that tracking attribute counts within reasoning traces provides key insights into how distractors, reasoning length, and accuracy interact. Finally, we demonstrate that these trends extend to established visual bias benchmarks such as Waterbirds, and we propose a simple prompting strategy to mitigate bias-driven predictions in reasoning models.

Conclusion: 通过核级模糊过程学习和解耦多尺度架构，实现了高效准确的图像去模糊，为理解模糊本质提供了新视角。

Abstract: It is well-known that if a network aims to learn how to deblur, it should understand the blur process. Blurring is naturally caused by the convolution of the sharp image with the blur kernel. Thus, allowing the network to learn the blur process in the kernel-level can significantly improve the image deblurring performance. But, current deep networks are still at the pixel-level learning stage, either performing end-to-end pixel-level restoration or stage-wise pseudo kernel-level restoration, failing to enable the deblur model to understand the essence of the blur. To this end, we propose Fourier Kernel Estimator (FKE), which considers the activation operation in Fourier space and converts the convolution problem in the spatial domain to a multiplication problem in Fourier space. Our FKE, jointly optimized with the deblur model, enables the network to learn the kernel-level blur process with low complexity and without any additional supervision. Furthermore, we change the convolution object of the kernel from ``image" to network extracted ``feature", whose rich semantic and structural information is more suitable to blur process learning. With the convolution of the feature and the estimated kernel, our model can learn the essence of blur in kernel-level. To further improve the efficiency of feature extraction, we design a decoupled multi-scale architecture with multiple hierarchical sub-unets with a reversible strategy, which allows better multi-scale encoding and decoding in low training memory. Extensive experiments indicate that our method achieves state-of-the-art motion deblurring results and show potential for handling other kernel-related problems. Analysis also shows our kernel estimator is able to learn physically meaningful kernels. The code will be available at https://github.com/DeepMed-Lab-ECNU/Single-Image-Deblur.

Abstract: Human video generation has advanced rapidly with the development of diffusion models, but the high computational cost and substantial memory consumption associated with training these models on high-resolution, multi-frame data pose significant challenges. In this paper, we propose Entropy-Guided Prioritized Progressive Learning (Ent-Prog), an efficient training framework tailored for diffusion models on human video generation. First, we introduce Conditional Entropy Inflation (CEI) to assess the importance of different model components on the target conditional generation task, enabling prioritized training of the most critical components. Second, we introduce an adaptive progressive schedule that adaptively increases computational complexity during training by measuring the convergence efficiency. Ent-Prog reduces both training time and GPU memory consumption while maintaining model performance. Extensive experiments across three datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of Ent-Prog, achieving up to 2.2$\times$ training speedup and 2.4$\times$ GPU memory reduction without compromising generative performance.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在空间智能方面表现不佳，缺乏从2D图像重建3D空间的视觉几何学习过程，导致空间理解和推理能力不足。

Method: 提出G²VLM模型，利用学习到的3D视觉几何特征直接预测3D属性，通过上下文学习和交错推理增强空间推理任务，统一设计可扩展地利用多视角图像和视频数据进行训练。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) still lack robustness in spatial intelligence, demonstrating poor performance on spatial understanding and reasoning tasks. We attribute this gap to the absence of a visual geometry learning process capable of reconstructing 3D space from 2D images. We present G$^2$VLM, a geometry grounded vision-language model that bridges two fundamental aspects of spatial intelligence: spatial 3D reconstruction and spatial understanding. G$^2$VLM natively leverages learned 3D visual geometry features to directly predict 3D attributes and enhance spatial reasoning tasks via in-context learning and interleaved reasoning. Our unified design is highly scalable for spatial understanding: it trains on abundant multi-view image and video data, while simultaneously leveraging the benefits of 3D visual priors that are typically only derived from hard-to-collect annotations. Experimental results demonstrate G$^2$VLM is proficient in both tasks, achieving comparable results to state-of-the-art feed-forward 3D reconstruction models and achieving better or competitive results across spatial understanding and reasoning tasks. By unifying a semantically strong VLM with low-level 3D vision tasks, we hope G$^2$VLM can serve as a strong baseline for the community and unlock more future applications, such as 3D scene editing.

TL;DR: 提出ProxyFormer，一种新的RVOS架构，通过代理查询整合视觉和文本语义，解决现有方法在跨帧依赖性和文本约束整合方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RVOS方法存在两个主要问题：条件查询缺乏跨帧依赖性和变化建模，难以处理帧间显著变化；文本约束整合过晚，可能导致视频特征关注非目标对象。

Method: 引入代理查询集来整合视觉和文本语义，通过多阶段视频特征编码器逐步更新和传播代理查询，将跨模态交互解耦为时间和空间维度，并设计联合语义一致性训练策略。

Result: 在四个广泛使用的RVOS基准测试上的综合实验表明，ProxyFormer优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: ProxyFormer通过代理查询机制有效解决了跨帧依赖性和文本约束整合问题，提高了目标跟踪的准确性和连贯性。

Abstract: Referring video object segmentation (RVOS) is an emerging cross-modality task that aims to generate pixel-level maps of the target objects referred by given textual expressions. The main concept involves learning an accurate alignment of visual elements and language expressions within a semantic space. Recent approaches address cross-modality alignment through conditional queries, tracking the target object using a query-response based mechanism built upon transformer structure. However, they exhibit two limitations: (1) these conditional queries lack inter-frame dependency and variation modeling, making accurate target tracking challenging amid significant frame-to-frame variations; and (2) they integrate textual constraints belatedly, which may cause the video features potentially focus on the non-referred objects. Therefore, we propose a novel RVOS architecture called ProxyFormer, which introduces a set of proxy queries to integrate visual and text semantics and facilitate the flow of semantics between them. By progressively updating and propagating proxy queries across multiple stages of video feature encoder, ProxyFormer ensures that the video features are focused on the object of interest. This dynamic evolution also enables the establishment of inter-frame dependencies, enhancing the accuracy and coherence of object tracking. To mitigate high computational costs, we decouple cross-modality interactions into temporal and spatial dimensions. Additionally, we design a Joint Semantic Consistency (JSC) training strategy to align semantic consensus between the proxy queries and the combined video-text pairs. Comprehensive experiments on four widely used RVOS benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our ProxyFormer to the state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有的安全评估方法主要关注静态图像和文本生成，无法捕捉视频生成中复杂的时序动态特性，导致对文本到视频模型的安全评估不足。

Method: 采用时间感知的测试生成器，通过两阶段优化（初始生成器训练和时间感知在线偏好学习）来生成看似无害的文本提示，利用时序动态特性诱导模型生成违反策略的视频内容，并通过循环精炼模型提高提示的隐蔽性和对抗效果。

Result: 在开源和商业文本到视频系统上的广泛实验评估显示，TEAR实现了超过80%的攻击成功率，相比之前最佳结果57%有显著提升。

Conclusion: TEAR框架有效揭示了文本到视频模型中与动态时序相关的安全风险，为视频生成系统的安全评估提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Text-to-Video (T2V) models are capable of synthesizing high-quality, temporally coherent dynamic video content, but the diverse generation also inherently introduces critical safety challenges. Existing safety evaluation methods,which focus on static image and text generation, are insufficient to capture the complex temporal dynamics in video generation. To address this, we propose a TEmporal-aware Automated Red-teaming framework, named TEAR, an automated framework designed to uncover safety risks specifically linked to the dynamic temporal sequencing of T2V models. TEAR employs a temporal-aware test generator optimized via a two-stage approach: initial generator training and temporal-aware online preference learning, to craft textually innocuous prompts that exploit temporal dynamics to elicit policy-violating video output. And a refine model is adopted to improve the prompt stealthiness and adversarial effectiveness cyclically. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of TEAR across open-source and commercial T2V systems with over 80% attack success rate, a significant boost from prior best result of 57%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型倾向于使用全局原生分辨率视觉编码，虽然提升了整体能力但带来更大的计算开销，需要解决这一效率问题。

Method: 提出渐进式视觉压缩方法，包含两个关键模块：改进的补丁嵌入支持灵活补丁大小缩放，窗口化令牌压缩在ViT层间分层部署以逐步聚合局部令牌表示。

Result: ViT-UHD在相同MLLM架构下，性能与MoonViT相当但TTFT降低2.4倍；LLaVA-UHD v3性能与Qwen2-VL相当但TTFT进一步降低1.9倍。

Conclusion: 渐进式视觉压缩方法能够将预训练的ViT重新配置为高效架构，在保持泛化能力的同时显著提升计算效率。

Abstract: Visual encoding followed by token condensing has become the standard architectural paradigm in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). Many recent MLLMs increasingly favor global native- resolution visual encoding over slice-based methods. To investigate this trend, we systematically compare their behavior on vision-language understanding and attention patterns, revealing that global encoding enhances overall capability but at the expense of greater computational overhead. To address this issue, we present LLaVA-UHD v3, an MLLM centered upon our proposed Progressive Visual Compression (PVC) method, which can be seamlessly integrated into standard Vision Transformer (ViT) to enable efficient native-resolution encoding. The PVC approach consists of two key modules: (i) refined patch embedding, which supports flexible patch-size scaling for fine-grained visual model- ing, (ii) windowed token compression, hierarchically deployed across ViT layers to progressively aggregate local token representations. Jointly modulated by these two modules, a widely pretrained ViT can be reconfigured into an efficient architecture while largely preserving generality. Evaluated across extensive benchmarks, the transformed ViT, termed ViT-UHD, demonstrates competitive performance with MoonViT while reducing TTFT (time-to-first-token) by 2.4x, when developed within an identical MLLM architecture. Building upon ViT-UHD, LLaVA-UHD v3 also achieves competitive performance to Qwen2-VL, while further reducing TTFT by 1.9x. We will release all code and checkpoints to support future research on efficient MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时扩展策略（如Best-of-N）在视觉自回归模型中效果不佳，因为它们在错误生成轨迹上消耗完整计算，且光栅扫描解码缺乏整个画布的蓝图，限制了扩展效益。

Method: GridAR采用网格分区渐进生成方案，在同一画布位置生成多个部分候选，早期修剪不可行候选，并将可行候选固定为锚点指导后续解码。同时使用布局指定提示重构策略，通过检查部分视图推断可行布局。

Result: 在N=4时，GridAR比Best-of-N（N=8）在T2I-CompBench++上性能提升14.4%，成本降低25.6%。在图像编辑任务中，PIE-Bench上语义保持能力提升13.9%。

Conclusion: GridAR框架有效解决了视觉自回归模型测试时扩展的挑战，在有限计算资源下实现了更高质量的生成结果，并具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent visual autoregressive (AR) models have shown promising capabilities in text-to-image generation, operating in a manner similar to large language models. While test-time computation scaling has brought remarkable success in enabling reasoning-enhanced outputs for challenging natural language tasks, its adaptation to visual AR models remains unexplored and poses unique challenges. Naively applying test-time scaling strategies such as Best-of-N can be suboptimal: they consume full-length computation on erroneous generation trajectories, while the raster-scan decoding scheme lacks a blueprint of the entire canvas, limiting scaling benefits as only a few prompt-aligned candidates are generated. To address these, we introduce GridAR, a test-time scaling framework designed to elicit the best possible results from visual AR models. GridAR employs a grid-partitioned progressive generation scheme in which multiple partial candidates for the same position are generated within a canvas, infeasible ones are pruned early, and viable ones are fixed as anchors to guide subsequent decoding. Coupled with this, we present a layout-specified prompt reformulation strategy that inspects partial views to infer a feasible layout for satisfying the prompt. The reformulated prompt then guides subsequent image generation to mitigate the blueprint deficiency. Together, GridAR achieves higher-quality results under limited test-time scaling: with N=4, it even outperforms Best-of-N (N=8) by 14.4% on T2I-CompBench++ while reducing cost by 25.6%. It also generalizes to autoregressive image editing, showing comparable edit quality and a 13.9% gain in semantic preservation on PIE-Bench over larger-N baselines.

Result: 在3D指代分割、3D视觉问答和3D密集描述任务上取得显著改进。

Conclusion: NDTokenizer3D提供了一个紧凑统一的通用3D VLM架构，成功连接语言推理与3D空间理解。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D vision-language models (VLMs) highlight a strong potential for 3D scene understanding and reasoning. However, effectively tokenizing 3D scenes into holistic scene tokens, and leveraging these tokens across diverse 3D understanding tasks, remain highly challenging. We present NDTokenizer3D, a generalist 3D VLM that performs a wide range of 3D scene understanding tasks while naturally supporting human interactions, thereby bridging language-level reasoning with 3D spatial understanding. The core of our approach is a novel three-stage scene tokenization pipeline built upon a Multi-Scale Normal Distributions Transform (NDT) representation, paired with a Multi-Scale NDT Decoder (MSDec). Specifically, NDTokenizer3D first constructs a multi-scale NDT representation from raw high-resolution point clouds, preserving both global context and fine-grained geometric details. Next, the MSDec progressively fuses cross-scale NDT features, producing holistic scene tokens consumable by LLM endpoints. Beyond tokenization, MSDec is repurposed as a general interface for human-interactive prompting (points, boxes, masks) and segmentation-mask decoding, unifying diverse 3D scene understanding tasks within a single architecture. With this compact and unified design, NDTokenizer3D offers a fine-grained, general-purpose 3D VLM, achieving remarkable improvements in 3D Referring Segmentation, 3D Visual Question Answering, and 3D Dense Captioning.

Conclusion: UPA-RFAS建立了未来防御的强大基线，展示了VLA模型对通用对抗补丁的脆弱性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, yet universal and transferable attacks remain underexplored, as most existing patches overfit to a single model and fail in black-box settings. To address this gap, we present a systematic study of universal, transferable adversarial patches against VLA-driven robots under unknown architectures, finetuned variants, and sim-to-real shifts. We introduce UPA-RFAS (Universal Patch Attack via Robust Feature, Attention, and Semantics), a unified framework that learns a single physical patch in a shared feature space while promoting cross-model transfer. UPA-RFAS combines (i) a feature-space objective with an $\ell_1$ deviation prior and repulsive InfoNCE loss to induce transferable representation shifts, (ii) a robustness-augmented two-phase min-max procedure where an inner loop learns invisible sample-wise perturbations and an outer loop optimizes the universal patch against this hardened neighborhood, and (iii) two VLA-specific losses: Patch Attention Dominance to hijack text$\to$vision attention and Patch Semantic Misalignment to induce image-text mismatch without labels. Experiments across diverse VLA models, manipulation suites, and physical executions show that UPA-RFAS consistently transfers across models, tasks, and viewpoints, exposing a practical patch-based attack surface and establishing a strong baseline for future defenses.

TL;DR: DCBoost是一个参数自由的插件方法，通过利用可靠的局部结构线索来增强深度聚类模型的全局特征结构，显著提升聚类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度聚类方法存在全局和局部特征结构不一致的问题：局部结构在类内样本中表现出强一致性和紧凑性，而全局特征往往边界交织、聚类分离效果差。

Method: 首先通过自适应k近邻一致性过滤识别高置信度样本作为可信锚点，然后利用这些样本计算判别性损失，促进类内紧凑性和类间分离性来指导网络优化。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，DCBoost显著提升了各种现有深度聚类模型的性能，将当前最先进基线（如ProPos）的性能提高了3%以上，并将轮廓系数放大了7倍以上。

Conclusion: DCBoost通过利用局部结构线索增强全局特征，有效解决了深度聚类中全局-局部特征不一致的问题，显著提升了聚类性能。

Abstract: Recent deep clustering models have produced impressive clustering performance. However, a common issue with existing methods is the disparity between global and local feature structures. While local structures typically show strong consistency and compactness within class samples, global features often present intertwined boundaries and poorly separated clusters. Motivated by this observation, we propose DCBoost, a parameter-free plug-in designed to enhance the global feature structures of current deep clustering models. By harnessing reliable local structural cues, our method aims to elevate clustering performance effectively. Specifically, we first identify high-confidence samples through adaptive $k$-nearest neighbors-based consistency filtering, aiming to select a sufficient number of samples with high label reliability to serve as trustworthy anchors for self-supervision. Subsequently, these samples are utilized to compute a discriminative loss, which promotes both intra-class compactness and inter-class separability, to guide network optimization. Extensive experiments across various benchmark datasets showcase that our DCBoost significantly improves the clustering performance of diverse existing deep clustering models. Notably, our method improves the performance of current state-of-the-art baselines (e.g., ProPos) by more than 3% and amplifies the silhouette coefficient by over $7\times$.

Abstract: Foundation models have demonstrated a remarkable ability to learn rich, transferable representations across diverse modalities such as images, text, and audio. In modern machine learning pipelines, these representations often replace raw data as the primary input for downstream tasks. In this paper, we address the challenge of adapting a pre-trained foundation model to inject domain-specific knowledge, without retraining from scratch or incurring significant computational costs. To this end, we introduce BotaCLIP, a lightweight multimodal contrastive framework that adapts a pre-trained Earth Observation foundation model (DOFA) by aligning high-resolution aerial imagery with botanical relevés. Unlike generic embeddings, BotaCLIP internalizes ecological structure through contrastive learning with a regularization strategy that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Once trained, the resulting embeddings serve as transferable representations for downstream predictors. Motivated by real-world applications in biodiversity modeling, we evaluated BotaCLIP representations in three ecological tasks: plant presence prediction, butterfly occurrence modeling, and soil trophic group abundance estimation. The results showed consistent improvements over those derived from DOFA and supervised baselines. More broadly, this work illustrates how domain-aware adaptation of foundation models can inject expert knowledge into data-scarce settings, enabling frugal representation learning.

TL;DR: 提出Action-Region Tracking (ART)框架，通过查询-响应机制发现和跟踪局部细节的动态变化，以区分细粒度动作类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前细粒度动作识别方法往往只能捕捉粗粒度运动模式，难以识别随时间演变的局部区域的细微差异。

Method: 使用区域特定语义激活模块，以区分性和文本约束的语义作为查询，在视频帧中捕获与动作最相关的区域响应；将响应组织成动作轨迹，通过多级轨迹对比约束优化；采用任务特定微调机制优化文本语义。

Result: 在广泛使用的动作识别基准测试中表现出优于先前最先进基线的性能。

Conclusion: ART框架通过跟踪局部细节动态，有效提升了细粒度动作识别的性能。

Abstract: Fine-grained action recognition (FGAR) aims to identify subtle and distinctive differences among fine-grained action categories. However, current recognition methods often capture coarse-grained motion patterns but struggle to identify subtle details in local regions evolving over time. In this work, we introduce the Action-Region Tracking (ART) framework, a novel solution leveraging a query-response mechanism to discover and track the dynamics of distinctive local details, enabling effective distinction of similar actions. Specifically, we propose a region-specific semantic activation module that employs discriminative and text-constrained semantics as queries to capture the most action-related region responses in each video frame, facilitating interaction among spatial and temporal dimensions with corresponding video features. The captured region responses are organized into action tracklets, which characterize region-based action dynamics by linking related responses across video frames in a coherent sequence. The text-constrained queries encode nuanced semantic representations derived from textual descriptions of action labels extracted by language branches within Visual Language Models (VLMs). To optimize the action tracklets, we design a multi-level tracklet contrastive constraint among region responses at spatial and temporal levels, enabling effective discrimination within each frame and correlation between adjacent frames. Additionally, a task-specific fine-tuning mechanism refines textual semantics such that semantic representations encoded by VLMs are preserved while optimized for task preferences. Comprehensive experiments on widely used action recognition benchmarks demonstrate the superiority to previous state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: 比较三种生成模型：DDPM、CFM和MeanFlow。CFM在50步采样时FID为24.15，显著优于DDPM的402.98。MeanFlow单步采样FID为29.15，推理时间减少50倍。还将CFM扩展到图像修复，在中心掩码上PSNR从4.95提升到8.57 dB，SSIM从0.289提升到0.418。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 比较三种生成建模范式的性能差异，特别是迭代采样（DDPM、CFM）与直接一步生成（MeanFlow）的权衡，并探索CFM在图像修复任务中的应用潜力。

Method: 使用统一的TinyUNet架构（<150万参数）在CIFAR-10上实现三种方法：DDPM、CFM和MeanFlow。CFM采用条件流匹配，MeanFlow通过建模时间间隔内的平均速度实现一步生成。还将CFM扩展到图像修复，实现四种掩码类型的掩码引导采样。

Result: CFM在50步采样时FID为24.15，显著优于DDPM的402.98。MeanFlow单步采样FID为29.15，推理时间减少50倍。图像修复模型在中心掩码上PSNR从4.95提升到8.57 dB（+73%），SSIM从0.289提升到0.418（+45%）。

Conclusion: CFM在生成质量上显著优于DDPM，MeanFlow在保持合理质量的同时大幅减少推理时间。CFM在图像修复任务中表现出色，修复感知训练能显著提升修复质量。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive comparative study of three generative modeling paradigms: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM), Conditional Flow Matching (CFM), and MeanFlow. While DDPM and CFM require iterative sampling, MeanFlow enables direct one-step generation by modeling the average velocity over time intervals. We implement all three methods using a unified TinyUNet architecture (<1.5M parameters) on CIFAR-10, demonstrating that CFM achieves an FID of 24.15 with 50 steps, significantly outperforming DDPM (FID 402.98). MeanFlow achieves FID 29.15 with single-step sampling -- a 50X reduction in inference time. We further extend CFM to image inpainting, implementing mask-guided sampling with four mask types (center, random bbox, irregular, half). Our fine-tuned inpainting model achieves substantial improvements: PSNR increases from 4.95 to 8.57 dB on center masks (+73%), and SSIM improves from 0.289 to 0.418 (+45%), demonstrating the effectiveness of inpainting-aware training.

Motivation: 部分音频伪造通过选择性修改关键帧而保持整体感知真实性，现有方法缺乏分层结构来捕捉不同时间层次的瞬时和持续异常。

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的数据集上进行广泛实验，证明该方法实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的分层检测框架能够全面捕捉部分音频伪造的痕迹，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Recently, partial audio forgery has emerged as a new form of audio manipulation. Attackers selectively modify partial but semantically critical frames while preserving the overall perceptual authenticity, making such forgeries particularly difficult to detect. Existing methods focus on independently detecting whether a single frame is forged, lacking the hierarchical structure to capture both transient and sustained anomalies across different temporal levels. To address these limitations, We identify three key levels relevant to partial audio forgery detection and present T3-Tracer, the first framework that jointly analyzes audio at the frame, segment, and audio levels to comprehensively detect forgery traces. T3-Tracer consists of two complementary core modules: the Frame-Audio Feature Aggregation Module (FA-FAM) and the Segment-level Multi-Scale Discrepancy-Aware Module (SMDAM). FA-FAM is designed to detect the authenticity of each audio frame. It combines both frame-level and audio-level temporal information to detect intra-frame forgery cues and global semantic inconsistencies. To further refine and correct frame detection, we introduce SMDAM to detect forgery boundaries at the segment level. It adopts a dual-branch architecture that jointly models frame features and inter-frame differences across multi-scale temporal windows, effectively identifying abrupt anomalies that appeared on the forged boundaries. Extensive experiments conducted on three challenging datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D人脸重建方法依赖2D监督且缺乏3D真实数据，难以捕捉细微的情感细节。

Method: 扩展自监督2D图像一致性线索，加入直接3D表情参数监督和辅助情感识别分支，使用4D面部扫描的真实表情参数指导编码器，并通过强度感知情感损失避免表情夸张。

Result: 生成情感丰富的3D人脸模型，显著提升野外面部表情识别性能，同时保持自然度。

Conclusion: 双重监督策略弥合了2D/3D领域差距，减轻了表情强度偏差，能够产生保留微妙情感线索的高保真3D重建结果。

Abstract: Facial expressions convey the bulk of emotional information in human communication, yet existing 3D face reconstruction methods often miss subtle affective details due to reliance on 2D supervision and lack of 3D ground truth. We propose FIELDS (Face reconstruction with accurate Inference of Expression using Learning with Direct Supervision) to address these limitations by extending self-supervised 2D image consistency cues with direct 3D expression parameter supervision and an auxiliary emotion recognition branch. Our encoder is guided by authentic expression parameters from spontaneous 4D facial scans, while an intensity-aware emotion loss encourages the 3D expression parameters to capture genuine emotion content without exaggeration. This dual-supervision strategy bridges the 2D/3D domain gap and mitigates expression-intensity bias, yielding high-fidelity 3D reconstructions that preserve subtle emotional cues. From a single image, FIELDS produces emotion-rich face models with highly realistic expressions, significantly improving in-the-wild facial expression recognition performance without sacrificing naturalness.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks have shown remarkable performance in recent years on various computer vision problems. However, the traditional convolutional neural network architecture lacks a critical property: shift equivariance and invariance, broken by downsampling and upsampling operations. Although data augmentation techniques can help the model learn the latter property empirically, a consistent and systematic way to achieve this goal is by designing downsampling and upsampling layers that theoretically guarantee these properties by construction. Adaptive Polyphase Sampling (APS) introduced the cornerstone for shift invariance, later extended to shift equivariance with Learnable Polyphase up/downsampling (LPS) applied to real-valued neural networks. In this paper, we extend the work on LPS to complex-valued neural networks both from a theoretical perspective and with a novel building block of a projection layer from $\mathbb{C}$ to $\mathbb{R}$ before the Gumbel Softmax. We finally evaluate this extension on several computer vision problems, specifically for either the invariance property in classification tasks or the equivariance property in both reconstruction and semantic segmentation problems, using polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar images.

Conclusion: AVFakeBench填补了现有基准的空白，为音视频伪造检测提供了更全面的评估标准，揭示了当前方法在复杂伪造场景中的局限性。

Abstract: The threat of Audio-Video (AV) forgery is rapidly evolving beyond human-centric deepfakes to include more diverse manipulations across complex natural scenes. However, existing benchmarks are still confined to DeepFake-based forgeries and single-granularity annotations, thus failing to capture the diversity and complexity of real-world forgery scenarios. To address this, we introduce AVFakeBench, the first comprehensive audio-video forgery detection benchmark that spans rich forgery semantics across both human subject and general subject. AVFakeBench comprises 12K carefully curated audio-video questions, covering seven forgery types and four levels of annotations. To ensure high-quality and diverse forgeries, we propose a multi-stage hybrid forgery framework that integrates proprietary models for task planning with expert generative models for precise manipulation. The benchmark establishes a multi-task evaluation framework covering binary judgment, forgery types classification, forgery detail selection, and explanatory reasoning. We evaluate 11 Audio-Video Large Language Models (AV-LMMs) and 2 prevalent detection methods on AVFakeBench, demonstrating the potential of AV-LMMs as emerging forgery detectors while revealing their notable weaknesses in fine-grained perception and reasoning.

Motivation: 现有LiDAR数据生成方法仅支持单帧生成，而预测方法需要多帧历史输入且只能确定性预测多帧，缺乏交互性，无法支持长序列交互生成。

Method: 提出LaGen框架，包含场景解耦估计模块增强对象级内容的交互生成能力，以及噪声调制模块减轻长序列生成中的误差累积。

Result: 在基于nuScenes构建的评估协议上，LaGen全面优于最先进的LiDAR生成和预测模型，尤其在后续帧上表现更优。

Conclusion: LaGen成功解决了长序列LiDAR场景的交互式生成问题，为自动驾驶中的生成世界模型提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Generative world models for autonomous driving (AD) have become a trending topic. Unlike the widely studied image modality, in this work we explore generative world models for LiDAR data. Existing generation methods for LiDAR data only support single frame generation, while existing prediction approaches require multiple frames of historical input and can only deterministically predict multiple frames at once, lacking interactivity. Both paradigms fail to support long-horizon interactive generation. To this end, we introduce LaGen, which to the best of our knowledge is the first framework capable of frame-by-frame autoregressive generation of long-horizon LiDAR scenes. LaGen is able to take a single-frame LiDAR input as a starting point and effectively utilize bounding box information as conditions to generate high-fidelity 4D scene point clouds. In addition, we introduce a scene decoupling estimation module to enhance the model's interactive generation capability for object-level content, as well as a noise modulation module to mitigate error accumulation during long-horizon generation. We construct a protocol based on nuScenes for evaluating long-horizon LiDAR scene generation. Experimental results comprehensively demonstrate LaGen outperforms state-of-the-art LiDAR generation and prediction models, especially on the later frames.

TL;DR: MatchGS是一个利用3D高斯泼溅技术生成高质量图像匹配训练数据的框架，通过几何校正和2D-3D表示对齐，显著提升了零样本图像匹配性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于学习的图像匹配需要大规模、多样化且几何精确的训练数据。3D高斯泼溅技术虽然能生成逼真的新视角图像，但其几何不准确性和深度渲染偏差限制了其在对应关系标注中的应用。

Method: 1) 几何精确的数据生成流程：改进3DGS几何结构以生成高精度对应关系标签；2) 2D-3D表示对齐策略：将3DGS的显式3D知识注入2D匹配器，指导学习视角不变的3D表示。

Result: 生成的对应关系将极线误差降低了40倍，支持极端视角变化下的监督学习。仅使用MatchGS数据训练的匹配器在公开基准测试中零样本性能提升达17.7%。

Conclusion: 通过适当的几何改进，3DGS可以作为可扩展、高保真且结构丰富的数据源，为新一代鲁棒的零样本图像匹配器铺平道路。

Abstract: Learning-based image matching critically depends on large-scale, diverse, and geometrically accurate training data. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables photorealistic novel-view synthesis and thus is attractive for data generation. However, its geometric inaccuracies and biased depth rendering currently prevent robust correspondence labeling. To address this, we introduce MatchGS, the first framework designed to systematically correct and leverage 3DGS for robust, zero-shot image matching. Our approach is twofold: (1) a geometrically-faithful data generation pipeline that refines 3DGS geometry to produce highly precise correspondence labels, enabling the synthesis of a vast and diverse range of viewpoints without compromising rendering fidelity; and (2) a 2D-3D representation alignment strategy that infuses 3DGS' explicit 3D knowledge into the 2D matcher, guiding 2D semi-dense matchers to learn viewpoint-invariant 3D representations. Our generated ground-truth correspondences reduce the epipolar error by up to 40 times compared to existing datasets, enable supervision under extreme viewpoint changes, and provide self-supervisory signals through Gaussian attributes. Consequently, state-of-the-art matchers trained solely on our data achieve significant zero-shot performance gains on public benchmarks, with improvements of up to 17.7%. Our work demonstrates that with proper geometric refinement, 3DGS can serve as a scalable, high-fidelity, and structurally-rich data source, paving the way for a new generation of robust zero-shot image matchers.

Abstract: With Transformers achieving outstanding performance on individual remote sensing (RS) tasks, we are now approaching the realization of a unified model that excels across multiple tasks through multi-task learning (MTL). Compared to single-task approaches, MTL methods offer improved generalization, enhanced scalability, and greater practical applicability. Recently, vision language models (VLMs) have achieved promising results in RS image understanding, grounding, and ultra-high-resolution (UHR) image reasoning, respectively. Moreover, the unified text-based interface demonstrates significant potential for MTL. Hence, in this work, we present RSCoVLM, a simple yet flexible VLM baseline for RS MTL. Firstly, we create the data curation engine, including data acquisition, offline processing and integrating, as well as online loading and weighting. This data engine effectively addresses complex RS data enviroment and generates flexible vision-language conversations. Furthermore, we propose a unified dynamic-resolution strategy to address the diverse image scales inherent in RS imagery. For UHR images, we introduce the Zoom-in Chain mechanism together with its corresponding dataset, LRS-VQA-Zoom. The strategies are flexible and effectively mitigate the computational burdens. Additionally, we significantly enhance the model's object detection capability and propose a novel evaluation protocol that ensures fair comparison between VLMs and conventional detection models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RSCoVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks, outperforming existing RS VLMs and even rivaling specialized expert models. All the training and evaluating tools, model weights, and datasets have been fully open-sourced to support reproducibility. We expect that this baseline will promote further progress toward general-purpose RS models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Vision Transformer的方法虽然能捕捉全局上下文，但二次复杂度限制了在资源受限平台上的部署效率，而Mamba等状态空间模型具有线性时间效率，更适合建模连续道路结构。

Method: 提出PathMamba混合架构，使用Mamba块追踪道路网络的连续特性以保持拓扑结构，同时集成Transformer块利用全局上下文细化特征。

Conclusion: PathMamba证明了Mamba和Transformer架构的互补优势，能够在不高昂计算成本的情况下实现拓扑优越的道路分割。

Abstract: Achieving both high accuracy and topological continuity in road segmentation from satellite imagery is a critical goal for applications ranging from urban planning to disaster response. State-of-the-art methods often rely on Vision Transformers, which excel at capturing global context, yet their quadratic complexity is a significant barrier to efficient deployment, particularly for on-board processing in resource-constrained platforms. In contrast, emerging State Space Models like Mamba offer linear-time efficiency and are inherently suited to modeling long, continuous structures. We posit that these architectures have complementary strengths. To this end, we introduce PathMamba, a novel hybrid architecture that integrates Mamba's sequential modeling with the Transformer's global reasoning. Our design strategically uses Mamba blocks to trace the continuous nature of road networks, preserving topological structure, while integrating Transformer blocks to refine features with global context. This approach yields topologically superior segmentation maps without the prohibitive scaling costs of pure attention-based models. Our experiments on the DeepGlobe Road Extraction and Massachusetts Roads datasets demonstrate that PathMamba sets a new state-of-the-art. Notably, it significantly improves topological continuity, as measured by the APLS metric, setting a new benchmark while remaining computationally competitive.

TL;DR: CaliTex是一个解决3D纹理生成中跨视图不一致问题的框架，通过几何校准的注意力机制来确保纹理在不同视角下的对齐和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于扩散模型的3D纹理生成系统存在跨视图不一致问题，即从一个视角看纹理合理，但在其他视角下无法对齐。这源于注意力模糊问题，无结构的全注意力机制导致几何混淆和不稳定的外观-结构耦合。

Method: 引入CaliTex框架，包含两个模块：部件对齐注意力（强制语义匹配部件间的空间对齐）和条件路由注意力（通过几何条件路径路由外观信息以保持空间保真度）。结合两阶段扩散变换器，使几何一致性成为网络的固有行为。

Result: CaliTex能够生成无缝且视图一致的纹理，在实验上优于开源和商业基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过几何校准的注意力机制，CaliTex有效解决了3D纹理生成中的跨视图不一致问题，使几何一致性成为生成过程的固有特性。

Abstract: Despite major advances brought by diffusion-based models, current 3D texture generation systems remain hindered by cross-view inconsistency -- textures that appear convincing from one viewpoint often fail to align across others. We find that this issue arises from attention ambiguity, where unstructured full attention is applied indiscriminately across tokens and modalities, causing geometric confusion and unstable appearance-structure coupling. To address this, we introduce CaliTex, a framework of geometry-calibrated attention that explicitly aligns attention with 3D structure. It introduces two modules: Part-Aligned Attention that enforces spatial alignment across semantically matched parts, and Condition-Routed Attention which routes appearance information through geometry-conditioned pathways to maintain spatial fidelity. Coupled with a two-stage diffusion transformer, CaliTex makes geometric coherence an inherent behavior of the network rather than a byproduct of optimization. Empirically, CaliTex produces seamless and view-consistent textures and outperforms both open-source and commercial baselines.

Conclusion: HTTM是有效的训练免费3D token合并方法，显著加速VGGT而保持重建质量

Abstract: The Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) marks a significant leap forward in 3D scene reconstruction, as it is the first model that directly infers all key 3D attributes (camera poses, depths, and dense geometry) jointly in one pass. However, this joint inference mechanism requires global attention layers that perform all-to-all attention computation on tokens from all views. For reconstruction of large scenes with long-sequence inputs, this causes a significant latency bottleneck. In this paper, we propose head-wise temporal merging (HTTM), a training-free 3D token merging method for accelerating VGGT. Existing merging techniques merge tokens uniformly across different attention heads, resulting in identical tokens in the layers' output, which hinders the model's representational ability. HTTM tackles this problem by merging tokens in multi-head granularity, which preserves the uniqueness of feature tokens after head concatenation. Additionally, this enables HTTM to leverage the spatial locality and temporal correspondence observed at the head level to achieve higher merging ratios with lower merging costs compared to existing methods. Thus, HTTM achieves up to 7x acceleration with negligible performance drops in a GPU-based inference.

<details>

Abstract: Learning joint representations across multiple modalities remains a central challenge in multimodal machine learning. Prevailing approaches predominantly operate in pairwise settings, aligning two modalities at a time. While some recent methods aim to capture higher-order interactions among multiple modalities, they often overlook or insufficiently preserve pairwise relationships, limiting their effectiveness on single-modality tasks. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Fusion (ConFu), a framework that jointly embeds both individual modalities and their fused combinations into a unified representation space, where modalities and their fused counterparts are aligned. ConFu extends traditional pairwise contrastive objectives with an additional fused-modality contrastive term, encouraging the joint embedding of modality pairs with a third modality. This formulation enables ConFu to capture higher-order dependencies, such as XOR-like relationships, that cannot be recovered through pairwise alignment alone, while still maintaining strong pairwise correspondence. We evaluate ConFu on synthetic and real-world multimodal benchmarks, assessing its ability to exploit cross-modal complementarity, capture higher-order dependencies, and scale with increasing multimodal complexity. Across these settings, ConFu demonstrates competitive performance on retrieval and classification tasks, while supporting unified one-to-one and two-to-one retrieval within a single contrastive framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发低延迟、低功耗的实时结构异常检测系统，用于交通基础设施安全监控，特别是可移动混凝土护栏。

Method: 集成尺度不变特征变换(SIFT)进行空间特征编码，使用延迟驱动的脉冲转换层和泄漏积分点火( LIF)脉冲神经网络(SNN)进行分类。

Result: 在奥克兰海港大桥数据集上实现92.3%的分类准确率，每帧推理时间9.5ms，脉冲稀疏度8.1%，支持实时边缘部署。

Conclusion: SIFT-SNN框架相比传统CNN方法具有更好的空间特征保持、可解释性和嵌入式硬件效率，但泛化到未见现场条件仍需验证。

Abstract: This paper presents the SIFT-SNN framework, a low-latency neuromorphic signal-processing pipeline for real-time detection of structural anomalies in transport infrastructure. The proposed approach integrates Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) for spatial feature encoding with a latency-driven spike conversion layer and a Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) Spiking Neural Network (SNN) for classification. The Auckland Harbour Bridge dataset is recorded under various weather and lighting conditions, comprising 6,000 labelled frames that include both real and synthetically augmented unsafe cases. The presented system achieves a classification accuracy of 92.3% (+- 0.8%) with a per-frame inference time of 9.5 ms. Achieved sub-10 millisecond latency, combined with sparse spike activity (8.1%), enables real-time, low-power edge deployment. Unlike conventional CNN-based approaches, the hybrid SIFT-SNN pipeline explicitly preserves spatial feature grounding, enhances interpretability, supports transparent decision-making, and operates efficiently on embedded hardware. Although synthetic augmentation improved robustness, generalisation to unseen field conditions remains to be validated. The SIFT-SNN framework is validated through a working prototype deployed on a consumer-grade system and framed as a generalisable case study in structural safety monitoring for movable concrete barriers, which, as a traffic flow-control infrastructure, is deployed in over 20 cities worldwide.

Extensive baseline experiments show that a single model trained on SurgMLLMBench achieves consistent performance across domains and generalizes effectively to unseen datasets. SurgMLLMBench will be publicly released as a robust resource to advance multimodal surgical AI research, supporting reproducible evaluation and development of interactive surgical reasoning models.

Motivation: 现有方法在处理不同数据或几何形状时难以确定合适的邻域大小，且参数繁重，无法准确高效地预测各种点云的法向量。

Conclusion: 基于多尺度特征聚合的近似策略能够实现不同局部邻域的尺度自适应，提供最优的特征描述，在点云法向量估计任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Estimating the normal of a point requires constructing a local patch to provide center-surrounding context, but determining the appropriate neighborhood size is difficult when dealing with different data or geometries. Existing methods commonly employ various parameter-heavy strategies to extract a full feature description from the input patch. However, they still have difficulties in accurately and efficiently predicting normals for various point clouds. In this work, we present a new idea of feature extraction for robust normal estimation of point clouds. We use the fusion of multi-scale features from different neighborhood sizes to address the issue of selecting reasonable patch sizes for various data or geometries. We seek to model a patch feature fitting (PFF) based on multi-scale features to approximate the optimal geometric description for normal estimation and implement the approximation process via multi-scale feature aggregation and cross-scale feature compensation. The feature aggregation module progressively aggregates the patch features of different scales to the center of the patch and shrinks the patch size by removing points far from the center. It not only enables the network to precisely capture the structure characteristic in a wide range, but also describes highly detailed geometries. The feature compensation module ensures the reusability of features from earlier layers of large scales and reveals associated information in different patch sizes. Our approximation strategy based on aggregating the features of multiple scales enables the model to achieve scale adaptation of varying local patches and deliver the optimal feature description. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets with fewer network parameters and running time.

TL;DR: Endo-G²T是一个用于动态内窥镜场景的几何引导和时间感知训练方案，通过几何先验蒸馏、时间嵌入高斯场和关键帧约束流式处理，在4D高斯溅射中实现早期几何锚定，保持时间一致性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内窥镜视频存在强烈的视角依赖效应，纯光度监督会与几何不对齐，导致早期几何漂移问题。需要一种方法在动态内窥镜场景中早期锚定几何，同时保持时间一致性和效率。

Method: 1) 几何引导先验蒸馏：将置信度门控的单目深度转换为监督信号；2) 时间嵌入高斯场：在XYZT中表示动态，使用转子样旋转参数化；3) 关键帧约束流式处理：在最大点数预算下进行关键帧优化，非关键帧轻量更新。

Conclusion: 提出的几何引导和时间感知训练方案成功解决了内窥镜视频重建中的几何漂移问题，实现了高质量的动态场景重建。

Abstract: Endoscopic (endo) video exhibits strong view-dependent effects such as specularities, wet reflections, and occlusions. Pure photometric supervision misaligns with geometry and triggers early geometric drift, where erroneous shapes are reinforced during densification and become hard to correct. We ask how to anchor geometry early for 4D Gaussian splatting (4DGS) while maintaining temporal consistency and efficiency in dynamic endoscopic scenes. Thus, we present Endo-G$^{2}$T, a geometry-guided and temporally aware training scheme for time-embedded 4DGS. First, geo-guided prior distillation converts confidence-gated monocular depth into supervision with scale-invariant depth and depth-gradient losses, using a warm-up-to-cap schedule to inject priors softly and avoid early overfitting. Second, a time-embedded Gaussian field represents dynamics in XYZT with a rotor-like rotation parameterization, yielding temporally coherent geometry with lightweight regularization that favors smooth motion and crisp opacity boundaries. Third, keyframe-constrained streaming improves efficiency and long-horizon stability through keyframe-focused optimization under a max-points budget, while non-keyframes advance with lightweight updates. Across EndoNeRF and StereoMIS-P1 datasets, Endo-G$^{2}$T achieves state-of-the-art results among monocular reconstruction baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多模态大语言模型具有强大的语言理解能力，但由于训练目标不对齐和标准视觉编码器中细粒度区域-词语对齐较弱，在时空视频定位任务上表现不佳。

Method: 提出边界框思维链机制，在生成最终预测前明确推理时空位置；设计包含格式、一致性、时间、空间和思考奖励的多维度强化奖励函数，通过强化微调提供几何感知监督。

Result: 在HCSTVG-v1/v2和VidSTG数据集上评估，STVG-o1在HCSTVG上创下新记录，在HCSTVG-v1上比最佳任务特定方法提升7.3% m_tIoU，在VidSTG上与专用模型表现相当，大幅超越所有现有基于MLLM的方法。

Conclusion: STVG-o1证明了多模态大语言模型可以作为精确时空定位任务的可信且强大的骨干网络，并展现出强大的跨数据集开放词汇泛化能力。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal video grounding (STVG) requires localizing a target object in untrimmed videos both temporally and spatially from natural language descriptions. Despite their strong language understanding, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) underperform on STVG due to misaligned training objectives and weak fine-grained region-word alignment in standard visual encoders. To address this, we propose STVG-o1, the first framework that enables off-the-shelf MLLMs to achieve state-of-the-art STVG performance without any architectural modifications. Our method introduces a bounding-box chain-of-thought mechanism that explicitly reasons about spatio-temporal locations in an intermediate step before producing the final prediction. We further design a multi-dimensional reinforcement reward function consisting of format, consistency, temporal, spatial, and think rewards, which provides geometry-aware supervision through reinforcement fine-tuning. Evaluated on HCSTVG-v1/v2 and VidSTG, STVG-o1 sets new state-of-the-art results on HCSTVG, outperforming the best task-specific method by 7.3\% m\_tIoU on HCSTVG-v1, matching specialized models on VidSTG, and surpassing all existing MLLM-based approaches by large margins. It also demonstrates strong open-vocabulary generalization across datasets, establishing MLLMs as viable and powerful backbones for precise spatio-temporal grounding. Our code and models will be released.

Abstract: "Thinking with images" has emerged as an effective paradigm for advancing visual reasoning, extending beyond text-only chains of thought by injecting visual evidence into intermediate reasoning steps. However, existing methods fall short of human-like abstract visual thinking, as their flexibility is fundamentally limited by external tools. In this work, we introduce Monet, a training framework that enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to reason directly within the latent visual space by generating continuous embeddings that function as intermediate visual thoughts. We identify two core challenges in training MLLMs for latent visual reasoning: high computational cost in latent-vision alignment and insufficient supervision over latent embeddings, and address them with a three-stage distillation-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT) pipeline. We further reveal a limitation of applying GRPO to latent reasoning: it primarily enhances text-based reasoning rather than latent reasoning. To overcome this, we propose VLPO (Visual-latent Policy Optimization), a reinforcement learning method that explicitly incorporates latent embeddings into policy gradient updates. To support SFT, we construct Monet-SFT-125K, a high-quality text-image interleaved CoT dataset containing 125K real-world, chart, OCR, and geometry CoTs. Our model, Monet-7B, shows consistent gains across real-world perception and reasoning benchmarks and exhibits strong out-of-distribution generalization on challenging abstract visual reasoning tasks. We also empirically analyze the role of each training component and discuss our early unsuccessful attempts, providing insights for future developments in visual latent reasoning.

Conclusion: DiverseVAR框架有效解决了VAR模型的多样性限制问题，为文本条件图像生成提供了更好的多样性-质量平衡方案。

Abstract: We introduce DiverseVAR, a framework that enhances the diversity of text-conditioned visual autoregressive models (VAR) at test time without requiring retraining, fine-tuning, or substantial computational overhead. While VAR models have recently emerged as strong competitors to diffusion and flow models for image generation, they suffer from a critical limitation in diversity, often producing nearly identical images even for simple prompts. This issue has largely gone unnoticed amid the predominant focus on image quality. We address this limitation at test time in two stages. First, inspired by diversity enhancement techniques in diffusion models, we propose injecting noise into the text embedding. This introduces a trade-off between diversity and image quality: as diversity increases, the image quality sharply declines. To preserve quality, we propose scale-travel: a novel latent refinement technique inspired by time-travel strategies in diffusion models. Specifically, we use a multi-scale autoencoder to extract coarse-scale tokens that enable us to resume generation at intermediate stages. Extensive experiments show that combining text-embedding noise injection with our scale-travel refinement significantly enhances diversity while minimizing image-quality degradation, achieving a new Pareto frontier in the diversity-quality trade-off.

Abstract: Remote sensing change captioning is an emerging and popular research task that aims to describe, in natural language, the content of interest that has changed between two remote sensing images captured at different times. Existing methods typically employ CNNs/Transformers to extract visual representations from the given images or incorporate auxiliary tasks to enhance the final results, with weak region awareness and limited temporal alignment. To address these issues, this paper explores the use of the SAM (Segment Anything Model) foundation model to extract region-level representations and inject region-of-interest knowledge into the captioning framework. Specifically, we employ a CNN/Transformer model to extract global-level vision features, leverage the SAM foundation model to delineate semantic- and motion-level change regions, and utilize a specially constructed knowledge graph to provide information about objects of interest. These heterogeneous sources of information are then fused via cross-attention, and a Transformer decoder is used to generate the final natural language description of the observed changes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple widely used benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: E-M3RF通过多模态特征融合有效解决了仅依赖几何特征的局限性，在3D重组任务中显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: 3D reassembly is a fundamental geometric problem, and in recent years it has increasingly been challenged by deep learning methods rather than classical optimization. While learning approaches have shown promising results, most still rely primarily on geometric features to assemble a whole from its parts. As a result, methods struggle when geometry alone is insufficient or ambiguous, for example, for small, eroded, or symmetric fragments. Additionally, solutions do not impose physical constraints that explicitly prevent overlapping assemblies. To address these limitations, we introduce E-M3RF, an equivariant multimodal 3D reassembly framework that takes as input the point clouds, containing both point positions and colors of fractured fragments, and predicts the transformations required to reassemble them using SE(3) flow matching. Each fragment is represented by both geometric and color features: i) 3D point positions are encoded as rotationconsistent geometric features using a rotation-equivariant encoder, ii) the colors at each 3D point are encoded with a transformer. The two feature sets are then combined to form a multimodal representation. We experimented on four datasets: two synthetic datasets, Breaking Bad and Fantastic Breaks, and two real-world cultural heritage datasets, RePAIR and Presious, demonstrating that E-M3RF on the RePAIR dataset reduces rotation error by 23.1% and translation error by 13.2%, while Chamfer Distance decreases by 18.4% compared to competing methods.

Abstract: We present a novel unsupervised framework to unlock vast unlabeled human demonstration data from continuous industrial video streams for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model pre-training. Our method first trains a lightweight motion tokenizer to encode motion dynamics, then employs an unsupervised action segmenter leveraging a novel "Latent Action Energy" metric to discover and segment semantically coherent action primitives. The pipeline outputs both segmented video clips and their corresponding latent action sequences, providing structured data directly suitable for VLA pre-training. Evaluations on public benchmarks and a proprietary electric motor assembly dataset demonstrate effective segmentation of key tasks performed by humans at workstations. Further clustering and quantitative assessment via a Vision-Language Model confirm the semantic coherence of the discovered action primitives. To our knowledge, this is the first fully automated end-to-end system for extracting and organizing VLA pre-training data from unstructured industrial videos, offering a scalable solution for embodied AI integration in manufacturing.

Abstract: Event cameras produce asynchronous event streams that are spatially sparse yet temporally dense. Mainstream event representation learning algorithms typically use event frames, voxels, or tensors as input. Although these approaches have achieved notable progress, they struggle to address the undersampling problem caused by spatial sparsity. In this paper, we propose a novel hypergraph-guided spatio-temporal event stream completion mechanism, which connects event tokens across different times and spatial locations via hypergraphs and leverages contextual information message passing to complete these sparse events. The proposed method can flexibly incorporate RGB tokens as nodes in the hypergraph within this completion framework, enabling multi-modal hypergraph-based information completion. Subsequently, we aggregate hypergraph node information across different time steps through self-attention, enabling effective learning and fusion of multi-modal features. Extensive experiments on both single- and multi-label event classification tasks fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

Abstract: Recently, video generation has witnessed rapid advancements, drawing increasing attention to image-to-video (I2V) synthesis on mobile devices. However, the substantial computational complexity and slow generation speed of diffusion models pose significant challenges for real-time, high-resolution video generation on resource-constrained mobile devices. In this work, we propose MobileI2V, a 270M lightweight diffusion model for real-time image-to-video generation on mobile devices. The core lies in: (1) We analyzed the performance of linear attention modules and softmax attention modules on mobile devices, and proposed a linear hybrid architecture denoiser that balances generation efficiency and quality. (2) We design a time-step distillation strategy that compresses the I2V sampling steps from more than 20 to only two without significant quality loss, resulting in a 10-fold increase in generation speed. (3) We apply mobile-specific attention optimizations that yield a 2-fold speed-up for attention operations during on-device inference. MobileI2V enables, for the first time, fast 720p image-to-video generation on mobile devices, with quality comparable to existing models. Under one-step conditions, the generation speed of each frame of 720p video is less than 100 ms. Our code is available at: https://github.com/hustvl/MobileI2V.

Abstract: Vision Transformers have demonstrated exceptional performance across various computer vision tasks, yet their quadratic computational complexity concerning token length remains a significant challenge. To address this, token reduction methods have been widely explored. However, existing approaches often overlook the frequency characteristics of self-attention, such as rank collapsing and over-smoothing phenomenon. In this paper, we propose a frequency-aware token reduction strategy that improves computational efficiency while preserving performance by mitigating rank collapsing. Our method partitions tokens into high-frequency tokens and low-frequency tokens. high-frequency tokens are selectively preserved, while low-frequency tokens are aggregated into a compact direct current token to retain essential low-frequency components. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves accuracy while reducing computational overhead and mitigating rank collapsing and over smoothing. Furthermore, we analyze the previous methods, shedding light on their implicit frequency characteristics and limitations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Merge-and-Bound (M&B)的类增量学习方法，通过在参数空间中直接操作模型权重进行优化，包含跨任务权重合并和任务内权重合并两种策略，并采用有界更新技术来减少灾难性遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决类增量学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，通过直接操作模型权重来优化模型，同时保留先前任务的知识。

Method: 使用两种权重合并策略：跨任务权重合并（平均所有先前阶段模型的权重）和任务内权重合并（在当前阶段内合并模型参数），并采用有界更新技术来限制参数更新范围。

Result: 在标准CIL基准测试中表现出色，性能优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: M&B方法能够有效减少灾难性遗忘，且无需修改架构组件或学习目标即可集成到现有CIL方法中。

Abstract: We present a novel training approach, named Merge-and-Bound (M&B) for Class Incremental Learning (CIL), which directly manipulates model weights in the parameter space for optimization. Our algorithm involves two types of weight merging: inter-task weight merging and intra-task weight merging. Inter-task weight merging unifies previous models by averaging the weights of models from all previous stages. On the other hand, intra-task weight merging facilitates the learning of current task by combining the model parameters within current stage. For reliable weight merging, we also propose a bounded update technique that aims to optimize the target model with minimal cumulative updates and preserve knowledge from previous tasks; this strategy reveals that it is possible to effectively obtain new models near old ones, reducing catastrophic forgetting. M&B is seamlessly integrated into existing CIL methods without modifying architecture components or revising learning objectives. We extensively evaluate our algorithm on standard CIL benchmarks and demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自注意力蒸馏方法独立对齐师生特征图，无法充分捕捉像素间的复杂关系，需要更有效的非局部知识传递机制

Method: 引入基于交叉注意力的非局部知识蒸馏框架，仅增加额外损失函数，让学生特征图的每个像素都能动态关注教师特征图的所有像素

Result: 在目标检测和图像分割任务上的大量实验表明，CanKD优于现有的特征和混合蒸馏方法，达到最先进性能

Conclusion: CanKD作为注意力引导蒸馏的新范式，在计算机视觉任务中展现出巨大潜力

Abstract: We propose Cross-Attention-based Non-local Knowledge Distillation (CanKD), a novel feature-based knowledge distillation framework that leverages cross-attention mechanisms to enhance the knowledge transfer process. Unlike traditional self-attention-based distillation methods that align teacher and student feature maps independently, CanKD enables each pixel in the student feature map to dynamically consider all pixels in the teacher feature map. This non-local knowledge transfer more thoroughly captures pixel-wise relationships, improving feature representation learning. Our method introduces only an additional loss function to achieve superior performance compared with existing attention-guided distillation methods. Extensive experiments on object detection and image segmentation tasks demonstrate that CanKD outperforms state-of-the-art feature and hybrid distillation methods. These experimental results highlight CanKD's potential as a new paradigm for attention-guided distillation in computer vision tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/tori-hotaru/CanKD

Motivation: 深度伪造检测方法的有效性往往更多地依赖于数据预处理、增强策略和优化技术等实现细节，而非核心设计，这使得公平比较检测器变得困难，也难以理解真正影响性能的因素。

Abstract: The effectiveness of deepfake detection methods often depends less on their core design and more on implementation details such as data preprocessing, augmentation strategies, and optimization techniques. These factors make it difficult to fairly compare detectors and to understand which factors truly contribute to their performance. To address this, we systematically investigate how different design choices influence the accuracy and generalization capabilities of deepfake detection models, focusing on aspects related to training, inference, and incremental updates. By isolating the impact of individual factors, we aim to establish robust, architecture-agnostic best practices for the design and development of future deepfake detection systems. Our experiments identify a set of design choices that consistently improve deepfake detection and enable state-of-the-art performance on the AI-GenBench benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ANA检测对诊断自身免疫疾病至关重要，但手动检测缓慢、劳动密集且需要多年训练。现有方法在真实临床环境中面临多实例多标签学习的挑战。

Method: 受人类标注逻辑启发，识别一致的ANA子区域并分配聚合标签。使用三个任务特定组件：实例采样器、概率伪标签分发器和自定步调学习率系数。

Result: 在ANA数据集上，相比最佳先前方法，F1-Macro提升+7.0%，mAP提升+12.6%。在公共数据集上，汉明损失和单错误分别降低18.2%和26.9%。

Conclusion: 该框架克服了传统MIML方法的限制，支持端到端优化，在ANA检测和医疗MIML基准测试中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Antinuclear antibody (ANA) testing is a crucial method for diagnosing autoimmune disorders, including lupus, Sjögren's syndrome, and scleroderma. Despite its importance, manual ANA detection is slow, labor-intensive, and demands years of training. ANA detection is complicated by over 100 coexisting antibody types, resulting in vast fluorescent pattern combinations. Although machine learning and deep learning have enabled automation, ANA detection in real-world clinical settings presents unique challenges as it involves multi-instance, multi-label (MIML) learning. In this paper, a novel framework for ANA detection is proposed that handles the complexities of MIML tasks using unaltered microscope images without manual preprocessing. Inspired by human labeling logic, it identifies consistent ANA sub-regions and assigns aggregated labels accordingly. These steps are implemented using three task-specific components: an instance sampler, a probabilistic pseudo-label dispatcher, and self-paced weight learning rate coefficients. The instance sampler suppresses low-confidence instances by modeling pattern confidence, while the dispatcher adaptively assigns labels based on instance distinguishability. Self-paced learning adjusts training according to empirical label observations. Our framework overcomes limitations of traditional MIML methods and supports end-to-end optimization. Extensive experiments on one ANA dataset and three public medical MIML benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our framework. On the ANA dataset, our model achieves up to +7.0% F1-Macro and +12.6% mAP gains over the best prior method, setting new state-of-the-art results. It also ranks top-2 across all key metrics on public datasets, reducing Hamming loss and one-error by up to 18.2% and 26.9%, respectively.

Conclusion: 该框架为构建可扩展且高效的遥感基础模型设定了新方向，解决了当前大规模模型方法的资源效率问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have shown great promise in domains such as natural language processing and computer vision, and similar efforts are now emerging in the Earth Observation community. These models aim to generalize across tasks with limited supervision, reducing the need for training separate models for each task. However, current strategies, which largely focus on scaling model size and dataset volume, require prohibitive computational and data resources, limiting accessibility to only a few large institutions. Moreover, this paradigm of ever-larger models stands in stark contrast with the principles of sustainable and environmentally responsible AI, as it leads to immense carbon footprints and resource inefficiency. In this work, we present a novel and efficient alternative: an Ensemble-of-Specialists framework for building Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs). Our method decomposes the training process into lightweight, task-specific ConvNeXtV2 specialists that can be frozen and reused. This modular approach offers strong advantages in efficiency, interpretability, and extensibility. Moreover, it naturally supports federated training, pruning, and continuous specialist integration, making it particularly well-suited for collaborative and resource-constrained settings. Our framework sets a new direction for building scalable and efficient RSFMs.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is a debilitating disorder marked by a decline in cognitive function. Timely identification of the disease is essential for the development of personalized treatment strategies that aim to mitigate its progression. The application of generated images for the prediction of Alzheimer's disease poses challenges, particularly in accurately representing the disease's characteristics when input sequences are captured at irregular time intervals. This study presents an innovative methodology for sequential image generation, guided by quantitative metrics, to maintain the essential features indicative of disease progression. Furthermore, an age-scaling factor is integrated into the process to produce age-specific MRI images, facilitating the prediction of advanced stages of the disease. The results obtained from the ablation study suggest that the inclusion of quantitative metrics significantly improves the accuracy of MRI image synthesis. Furthermore, the application of age-scaled pixel loss contributed to the enhanced iterative generation of MRI images. In terms of long-term disease prognosis, the Structural Similarity Index reached a peak value of 0.882, indicating a substantial degree of similarity in the synthesized images.

Result: PRFL显著改善了与人类偏好的对齐效果，同时实现了内存消耗和训练时间的大幅减少

Conclusion: 在潜在空间进行奖励反馈学习是视频生成对齐的有效方法，PRFL框架提供了更高效和全面的优化方案

Abstract: Reward feedback learning (ReFL) has proven effective for aligning image generation with human preferences. However, its extension to video generation faces significant challenges. Existing video reward models rely on vision-language models designed for pixel-space inputs, confining ReFL optimization to near-complete denoising steps after computationally expensive VAE decoding. This pixel-space approach incurs substantial memory overhead and increased training time, and its late-stage optimization lacks early-stage supervision, refining only visual quality rather than fundamental motion dynamics and structural coherence. In this work, we show that pre-trained video generation models are naturally suited for reward modeling in the noisy latent space, as they are explicitly designed to process noisy latent representations at arbitrary timesteps and inherently preserve temporal information through their sequential modeling capabilities. Accordingly, we propose Process Reward Feedback Learning~(PRFL), a framework that conducts preference optimization entirely in latent space, enabling efficient gradient backpropagation throughout the full denoising chain without VAE decoding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRFL significantly improves alignment with human preferences, while achieving substantial reductions in memory consumption and training time compared to RGB ReFL.

Motivation: 多视图3D重建中的光照不一致性是一个基本挑战，现有数据集要么缺乏有意义的光照多样性，要么包含几何和语义变化，无法孤立研究光照鲁棒性。

Conclusion: UAVLight为开发和基准测试在真实室外环境中具有光照鲁棒性的3D重建方法提供了可靠基础。

Abstract: Illumination inconsistency is a fundamental challenge in multi-view 3D reconstruction. Variations in sunlight direction, cloud cover, and shadows break the constant-lighting assumption underlying both classical multi-view stereo (MVS) and structure from motion (SfM) pipelines and recent neural rendering methods, leading to geometry drift, color inconsistency, and shadow imprinting. This issue is especially critical in UAV-based reconstruction, where long flight durations and outdoor environments make lighting changes unavoidable. However, existing datasets either restrict capture to short time windows, thus lacking meaningful illumination diversity, or span months and seasons, where geometric and semantic changes confound the isolated study of lighting robustness. We introduce UAVLight, a controlled-yet-real benchmark for illumination-robust 3D reconstruction. Each scene is captured along repeatable, geo-referenced flight paths at multiple fixed times of day, producing natural lighting variation under consistent geometry, calibration, and viewpoints. With standardized evaluation protocols across lighting conditions, UAVLight provides a reliable foundation for developing and benchmarking reconstruction methods that are consistent, faithful, and relightable in real outdoor environments.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose a significant threat to learning-based 3D point cloud models, critically undermining their reliability in security-sensitive applications. Existing defense methods often suffer from (1) high computational overhead and (2) poor generalization ability across diverse attack types. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel yet efficient teacher-student framework, namely Multimodal Robust Prompt Distillation (MRPD) for distilling robust 3D point cloud model. It learns lightweight prompts by aligning student point cloud model's features with robust embeddings from three distinct teachers: a vision model processing depth projections, a high-performance 3D model, and a text encoder. To ensure a reliable knowledge transfer, this distillation is guided by a confidence-gated mechanism which dynamically balances the contribution of all input modalities. Notably, since the distillation is all during the training stage, there is no additional computational cost at inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MRPD substantially outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods against a wide range of white-box and black-box attacks, while even achieving better performance on clean data. Our work presents a new, practical paradigm for building robust 3D vision systems by efficiently harnessing multimodal knowledge.

Abstract: Automated landmark detection offers an efficient approach for medical professionals to understand patient anatomic structure and positioning using intra-operative imaging. While current detection methods for pelvic fluoroscopy demonstrate promising accuracy, most assume a fixed Antero-Posterior view of the pelvis. However, orientation often deviates from this standard view, either due to repositioning of the imaging unit or of the target structure itself. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that incorporates 2D/3D landmark registration into the training of a U-Net landmark prediction model. We analyze the performance difference by comparing landmark detection accuracy between the baseline U-Net, U-Net trained with Pose Estimation Loss, and U-Net fine-tuned with Pose Estimation Loss under realistic intra-operative conditions where patient pose is variable.

Conclusion: Harmony通过机制性地强制音频-视频同步，有效解决了联合扩散过程中的根本挑战，为同步音频-视觉内容合成提供了创新解决方案。

Abstract: The synthesis of synchronized audio-visual content is a key challenge in generative AI, with open-source models facing challenges in robust audio-video alignment. Our analysis reveals that this issue is rooted in three fundamental challenges of the joint diffusion process: (1) Correspondence Drift, where concurrently evolving noisy latents impede stable learning of alignment; (2) inefficient global attention mechanisms that fail to capture fine-grained temporal cues; and (3) the intra-modal bias of conventional Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), which enhances conditionality but not cross-modal synchronization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Harmony, a novel framework that mechanistically enforces audio-visual synchronization. We first propose a Cross-Task Synergy training paradigm to mitigate drift by leveraging strong supervisory signals from audio-driven video and video-driven audio generation tasks. Then, we design a Global-Local Decoupled Interaction Module for efficient and precise temporal-style alignment. Finally, we present a novel Synchronization-Enhanced CFG (SyncCFG) that explicitly isolates and amplifies the alignment signal during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Harmony establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming existing methods in both generation fidelity and, critically, in achieving fine-grained audio-visual synchronization.

Abstract: Oral cancer is highly common across the globe and is mostly diagnosed during the later stages due to the close visual similarity to benign, precancerous, and malignant lesions in the oral cavity. Implementing computer aided diagnosis systems early on has the potential to greatly improve clinical outcomes. This research intends to use deep learning to build a multiclass classifier for sixteen different oral lesions. To overcome the challenges of limited and imbalanced datasets, the proposed technique combines stratified data splitting and advanced data augmentation and oversampling to perform the classification. The experimental results, which achieved 83.33 percent accuracy, 89.12 percent precision, and 77.31 percent recall, demonstrate the superiority of the suggested model over state of the art methods now in use. The suggested model effectively conveys the effectiveness of oversampling and augmentation strategies in situations where the minority class classification performance is noteworthy. As a first step toward trustworthy computer aided diagnostic systems for the early detection of oral cancer in clinical settings, the suggested framework shows promise.

Motivation: 现有视频扩散模型在帧级保真度上表现良好，但在运动连贯性、动态性和真实性方面存在不足，常产生抖动、重影或不合理的动态效果。标准的去噪MSE目标缺乏对时间一致性的直接监督。

Method: 基于3步蒸馏的视频扩散模型，训练基于DiT的光学流判别器来区分真实与生成的运动，结合分布匹配正则化器保持视觉保真度。

Result: 在VBench上，MoGAN比50步教师模型提升运动得分7.3%，比3步DMD模型提升13.3%；在VideoJAM-Bench上分别提升7.4%和8.8%，同时保持相当或更好的美学和图像质量得分。人类研究也证实MoGAN在运动质量上更受偏好。

Conclusion: MoGAN在不牺牲视觉保真度或效率的前提下，显著提升了运动真实性，为快速高质量视频生成提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Video diffusion models achieve strong frame-level fidelity but still struggle with motion coherence, dynamics and realism, often producing jitter, ghosting, or implausible dynamics. A key limitation is that the standard denoising MSE objective provides no direct supervision on temporal consistency, allowing models to achieve low loss while still generating poor motion. We propose MoGAN, a motion-centric post-training framework that improves motion realism without reward models or human preference data. Built atop a 3-step distilled video diffusion model, we train a DiT-based optical-flow discriminator to differentiate real from generated motion, combined with a distribution-matching regularizer to preserve visual fidelity. With experiments on Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B, MoGAN substantially improves motion quality across benchmarks. On VBench, MoGAN boosts motion score by +7.3% over the 50-step teacher and +13.3% over the 3-step DMD model. On VideoJAM-Bench, MoGAN improves motion score by +7.4% over the teacher and +8.8% over DMD, while maintaining comparable or even better aesthetic and image-quality scores. A human study further confirms that MoGAN is preferred for motion quality (52% vs. 38% for the teacher; 56% vs. 29% for DMD). Overall, MoGAN delivers significantly more realistic motion without sacrificing visual fidelity or efficiency, offering a practical path toward fast, high-quality video generation.

Abstract: Interactive segmentation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) have demonstrated remarkable generalization on natural images, but perform suboptimally on remote sensing imagery (RSI) due to severe domain shift and the scarcity of dense annotations. To address this, we propose a self-prompting, point-supervised framework that adapts SAM to RSIs using only sparse point annotations. Our method employs a Refine-Requery-Reinforce loop, where coarse pseudo-masks are generated from initial points (Refine), improved with self-constructed box prompts (Requery), and embeddings are aligned across iterations to reduce confirmation bias (Reinforce). Without relying on full-mask supervision, our approach progressively enhances SAM's segmentation quality and domain robustness through self-guided prompt adaptation . We evaluate our proposed method on three RSI benchmark datasets, including WHU, HRSID, and NWPU VHR-10, showing that our method consistently surpasses pretrained SAM and recent point-supervised segmentation methods. Our results demonstrate that self-prompting and semantic alignment provide an efficient path towards scalable, point-level adaptation of foundation segmentation models for remote sensing applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种标签高效的图卷积网络模型，通过对抗策略选择信息丰富的样本进行标注，并引入双向稳定GCN架构来改进骨架动作识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图卷积网络在骨架动作识别中依赖大量标注数据，但在实际应用中标注数据往往稀缺，需要开发标签高效的模型。

Method: 1. 开发新颖的采集函数，使用对抗策略选择代表性、多样性和不确定性平衡的紧凑样本集进行标注；2. 引入双向稳定GCN架构，改进环境空间和潜在数据空间之间的映射。

Result: 在两个具有挑战性的骨架动作识别基准测试中，与先前工作相比取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: 提出的标签高效GCN模型在减少标注数据需求的同时，显著提升了骨架动作识别的性能。

Abstract: Despite the notable success of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in skeleton-based action recognition, their performance often depends on large volumes of labeled data, which are frequently scarce in practical settings. To address this limitation, we propose a novel label-efficient GCN model. Our work makes two primary contributions. First, we develop a novel acquisition function that employs an adversarial strategy to identify a compact set of informative exemplars for labeling. This selection process balances representativeness, diversity, and uncertainty. Second, we introduce bidirectional and stable GCN architectures. These enhanced networks facilitate a more effective mapping between the ambient and latent data spaces, enabling a better understanding of the learned exemplar distribution. Extensive evaluations on two challenging skeleton-based action recognition benchmarks reveal significant improvements achieved by our label-efficient GCNs compared to prior work.

TL;DR: Qwen3-VL是Qwen系列中最强大的视觉语言模型，在多项多模态基准测试中表现优异，支持256K token的交错上下文，集成了文本、图像和视频处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能够处理长上下文、支持多种模态输入、并在文本理解和多模态推理方面表现卓越的视觉语言模型，以满足现实工作流程中的图像推理、智能决策和多模态代码智能需求。

Method: 采用增强的交错MRoPE进行时空建模，集成DeepStack以利用多级ViT特征加强视觉语言对齐，使用基于文本的时间对齐技术进行视频处理，并提供密集和混合专家两种架构变体。

Result: 在MMMU、MathVista和MathVision等综合评估中取得领先性能，在纯文本理解、长上下文理解和多模态推理方面均表现优异。

Conclusion: Qwen3-VL作为一个基础引擎，有望在图像推理、智能决策和多模态代码智能等现实工作流程中发挥重要作用。

Abstract: We introduce Qwen3-VL, the most capable vision-language model in the Qwen series to date, achieving superior performance across a broad range of multimodal benchmarks. It natively supports interleaved contexts of up to 256K tokens, seamlessly integrating text, images, and video. The model family includes both dense (2B/4B/8B/32B) and mixture-of-experts (30B-A3B/235B-A22B) variants to accommodate diverse latency-quality trade-offs. Qwen3-VL delivers three core pillars: (i) markedly stronger pure-text understanding, surpassing comparable text-only backbones in several cases; (ii) robust long-context comprehension with a native 256K-token window for both text and interleaved multimodal inputs, enabling faithful retention, retrieval, and cross-referencing across long documents and videos; and (iii) advanced multimodal reasoning across single-image, multi-image, and video tasks, demonstrating leading performance on comprehensive evaluations such as MMMU and visual-math benchmarks (e.g., MathVista and MathVision). Architecturally, we introduce three key upgrades: (i) an enhanced interleaved-MRoPE for stronger spatial-temporal modeling across images and video; (ii) DeepStack integration, which effectively leverages multi-level ViT features to tighten vision-language alignment; and (iii) text-based time alignment for video, evolving from T-RoPE to explicit textual timestamp alignment for more precise temporal grounding. Under comparable token budgets and latency constraints, Qwen3-VL achieves superior performance in both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. We envision Qwen3-VL serving as a foundational engine for image-grounded reasoning, agentic decision-making, and multimodal code intelligence in real-world workflows.

TL;DR: 提出了一种在资源受限设备上通过小样本学习纠正AI误分类的新系统，使用服务器端基础模型训练和设备端原型分类相结合的方法，实现高效错误纠正。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI模型在日常设备中的普及凸显了一个关键挑战：预测错误会降低用户体验。现有解决方案主要关注错误检测，但很少提供有效的纠正机制，特别是在资源受限设备上。

Method: 系统包含两个关键组件：(1) 服务器端管道利用知识蒸馏将鲁棒特征表示从基础模型转移到设备兼容架构；(2) 设备端机制通过原型适配实现超高效错误纠正，使用原型更新而非模型重训练。

Result: 在图像分类和物体检测任务中，在Food-101和Flowers-102数据集上的一样本场景中实现了超过50%的错误纠正率，同时保持极低的遗忘率（小于0.02%）和可忽略的计算开销。

Conclusion: 通过Android演示应用验证了系统在实际场景中的实用性，证明了该方法在资源受限设备上高效纠正AI错误的可行性。

Abstract: The proliferation of AI models in everyday devices has highlighted a critical challenge: prediction errors that degrade user experience. While existing solutions focus on error detection, they rarely provide efficient correction mechanisms, especially for resource-constrained devices. We present a novel system enabling users to correct AI misclassifications through few-shot learning, requiring minimal computational resources and storage. Our approach combines server-side foundation model training with on-device prototype-based classification, enabling efficient error correction through prototype updates rather than model retraining. The system consists of two key components: (1) a server-side pipeline that leverages knowledge distillation to transfer robust feature representations from foundation models to device-compatible architectures, and (2) a device-side mechanism that enables ultra-efficient error correction through prototype adaptation. We demonstrate our system's effectiveness on both image classification and object detection tasks, achieving over 50% error correction in one-shot scenarios on Food-101 and Flowers-102 datasets while maintaining minimal forgetting (less than 0.02%) and negligible computational overhead. Our implementation, validated through an Android demonstration app, proves the system's practicality in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: CaFlow是一个用于长期动作质量评估的统一框架，结合了反事实去混淆和双向时间条件流，通过因果反事实正则化和双向流模块提升长期动作评估的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长期动作质量评估（如花样滑冰或艺术体操）面临挑战，需要建模长期时间动态并保持对上下文混淆因素的鲁棒性。现有方法依赖昂贵标注或单向时间建模，容易受到伪相关性和不稳定长期表示的影响。

Method: 提出CaFlow框架，包含两个核心模块：1）因果反事实正则化（CCR）模块，以自监督方式解耦因果特征和混淆特征，通过反事实干预增强因果鲁棒性；2）BiT-Flow模块，建模前向和后向动态，通过循环一致性约束产生更平滑和连贯的表示。

Result: 在多个长期AQA基准测试上的广泛实验表明，CaFlow达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: CaFlow通过结合因果反事实正则化和双向时间建模，有效解决了长期动作质量评估中的挑战，在多个基准测试上表现出色。

Abstract: Action Quality Assessment (AQA) predicts fine-grained execution scores from action videos and is widely applied in sports, rehabilitation, and skill evaluation. Long-term AQA, as in figure skating or rhythmic gymnastics, is especially challenging since it requires modeling extended temporal dynamics while remaining robust to contextual confounders. Existing approaches either depend on costly annotations or rely on unidirectional temporal modeling, making them vulnerable to spurious correlations and unstable long-term representations. To this end, we propose CaFlow, a unified framework that integrates counterfactual de-confounding with bidirectional time-conditioned flow. The Causal Counterfactual Regularization (CCR) module disentangles causal and confounding features in a self-supervised manner and enforces causal robustness through counterfactual interventions, while the BiT-Flow module models forward and backward dynamics with a cycle-consistency constraint to produce smoother and more coherent representations. Extensive experiments on multiple long-term AQA benchmarks demonstrate that CaFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at https://github.com/Harrison21/CaFlow

TL;DR: Multi-Crit是一个评估多模态模型作为评判者能力的基准，测试模型遵循多样化细粒度评估标准的能力，发现现有模型在遵循多元标准方面仍有困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型越来越多地被用作多模态评估系统的评判者，但它们遵循多样化、细粒度评估标准的能力尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 通过严格的数据整理流程构建Multi-Crit基准，收集具有多标准人工标注的挑战性响应对，并引入三个新指标系统评估多元标准遵循能力。

Result: 对25个LMMs的综合分析显示：专有模型在遵循多元标准方面仍存在困难；开源模型在灵活遵循多样化标准方面更落后；基于整体判断信号的批评微调无法泛化到多元标准级判断。

Conclusion: Multi-Crit为构建可靠和可操控的多模态AI评估奠定了基础，揭示了当前多模态评判者的局限性。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) are increasingly adopted as judges in multimodal evaluation systems due to their strong instruction following and consistency with human preferences. However, their ability to follow diverse, fine-grained evaluation criteria remains underexplored. We develop Multi-Crit, a benchmark for evaluating multimodal judges on their capacity to follow pluralistic criteria and produce reliable criterion-level judgments. Covering both open-ended generation and verifiable reasoning tasks, Multi-Crit is built through a rigorous data curation pipeline that gathers challenging response pairs with multi-criterion human annotations. It further introduces three novel metrics for systematically assessing pluralistic adherence, criterion-switching flexibility, and the ability to recognize criterion-level preference conflicts. Comprehensive analysis of 25 LMMs reveals that 1) proprietary models still struggle to maintain consistent adherence to pluralistic criteria--especially in open-ended evaluation; 2) open-source models lag further behind in flexibly following diverse criteria; and 3) critic fine-tuning with holistic judgment signals enhances visual grounding but fails to generalize to pluralistic criterion-level judgment. Additional analyses on reasoning fine-tuning, test-time scaling, and boundary consistency between open-source and proprietary models further probe the limits of current multimodal judges. As a pioneering study, Multi-Crit lays the foundation for building reliable and steerable multimodal AI evaluation.

TL;DR: ADVLA是一种针对视觉-语言-动作(VLA)模型的对抗攻击框架，通过在视觉编码器到文本特征空间的投影特征上直接应用对抗扰动，实现高效、低幅度且局部稀疏的攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法需要昂贵的端到端训练，且通常生成明显的扰动斑块，因此需要开发更高效、更隐蔽的攻击方法。

Method: ADVLA框架在视觉编码器投影到文本特征空间的特征上直接应用对抗扰动，结合注意力引导使扰动集中且稀疏，采用三种策略增强敏感性、强制稀疏性和集中扰动。

Result: 在L∞=4/255约束下，ADVLA结合Top-K掩码修改不到10%的斑块，攻击成功率接近100%，扰动集中在关键区域，整体图像几乎不可察觉，单步迭代仅需约0.06秒。

Conclusion: ADVLA在低幅度和局部稀疏条件下有效削弱VLA模型的下游动作预测，避免了传统斑块攻击的高训练成本和明显扰动，对攻击VLA特征空间具有独特有效性和实用价值。

Abstract: In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in embodied intelligence have developed rapidly. However, existing adversarial attack methods require costly end-to-end training and often generate noticeable perturbation patches. To address these limitations, we propose ADVLA, a framework that directly applies adversarial perturbations on features projected from the visual encoder into the textual feature space. ADVLA efficiently disrupts downstream action predictions under low-amplitude constraints, and attention guidance allows the perturbations to be both focused and sparse. We introduce three strategies that enhance sensitivity, enforce sparsity, and concentrate perturbations. Experiments demonstrate that under an $L_{\infty}=4/255$ constraint, ADVLA combined with Top-K masking modifies less than 10% of the patches while achieving an attack success rate of nearly 100%. The perturbations are concentrated on critical regions, remain almost imperceptible in the overall image, and a single-step iteration takes only about 0.06 seconds, significantly outperforming conventional patch-based attacks. In summary, ADVLA effectively weakens downstream action predictions of VLA models under low-amplitude and locally sparse conditions, avoiding the high training costs and conspicuous perturbations of traditional patch attacks, and demonstrates unique effectiveness and practical value for attacking VLA feature spaces.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胶质瘤具有高死亡率，早期准确诊断对治疗干预至关重要。传统方法在处理高维3D MRI数据和关注临床相关特征方面存在局限。

Method: 开发混合深度学习框架：U-Net分割网络精确定位肿瘤区域，DenseNet-VGG混合分类网络结合多头注意力和空间通道注意力机制，通过预处理步骤（归一化、重采样、数据增强）处理3D MRI数据。

Result: 分割性能：Dice系数98%，平均交并比优秀；分类性能：准确率99%，精确率、召回率和F1分数均表现优异，超越传统CNN模型和无注意力方法。

Conclusion: 该混合框架在胶质瘤诊断和分级方面具有巨大潜力，通过注意力机制增强了对临床重要特征的关注，提高了可解释性和准确性，有助于改善患者治疗规划。

Abstract: Gliomas are brain tumor types that have a high mortality rate which means early and accurate diagnosis is important for therapeutic intervention for the tumors. To address this difficulty, the proposed research will develop a hybrid deep learning model which integrates U-Net based segmentation and a hybrid DenseNet-VGG classification network with multihead attention and spatial-channel attention capabilities. The segmentation model will precisely demarcate the tumors in a 3D volume of MRI data guided by spatial and contextual information. The classification network which combines a branch of both DenseNet and VGG, will incorporate the demarcated tumor on which features with attention mechanisms would be focused on clinically relevant features. High-dimensional 3D MRI data could successfully be utilized in the model through preprocessing steps which are normalization, resampling, and data augmentation. Through a variety of measures the framework is evaluated: measures of performance in segmentation are Dice coefficient and Mean Intersection over Union (IoU) and measures of performance in classification are accuracy precision, recall, and F1-score. The hybrid framework that has been proposed has demonstrated through physical testing that it has the capability of obtaining a Dice coefficient of 98% in tumor segmentation, and 99% on classification accuracy, outperforming traditional CNN models and attention-free methods. Utilizing multi-head attention mechanisms enhances notions of priority in aspects of the tumor that are clinically significant, and enhances interpretability and accuracy. The results suggest a great potential of the framework in facilitating the timely and reliable diagnosis and grading of glioma by clinicians is promising, allowing for better planning of patient treatment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索是否可以不依赖像素内容，仅通过相机运动轨迹来理解视频内容，这是一个看似不可能但具有重要价值的问题。

Method: 提出对比学习框架训练CamFormer编码器，将相机姿态轨迹投影到联合嵌入空间，与自然语言对齐。

Result: 相机轨迹是揭示视频内容的强有力信号，CamFormer嵌入在跨模态对齐、分类和时间分析等任务中表现优异，且对不同的相机姿态估计方法具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 相机轨迹是一种轻量级、鲁棒且多功能的感知视频内容的模态。

Abstract: Can one perceive a video's content without seeing its pixels, just from the camera trajectory-the path it carves through space? This paper is the first to systematically investigate this seemingly implausible question. Towards this end, we propose a contrastive learning framework to train CamFormer, a dedicated encoder that projects camera pose trajectories into a joint embedding space, aligning them with natural language. We find that, contrary to its apparent simplicity, the camera trajectory is a remarkably informative signal to uncover video content. In other words, "how you move" can indeed reveal "what you are doing" (egocentric) or "observing" (exocentric). We demonstrate the versatility of our learned CamFormer embeddings on a diverse suite of downstream tasks, ranging from cross-modal alignment to classification and temporal analysis. Importantly, our representations are robust across diverse camera pose estimation methods, including both high-fidelity multi-sensored and standard RGB-only estimators. Our findings establish camera trajectory as a lightweight, robust, and versatile modality for perceiving video content.

Conclusion: Canvas-to-Image通过统一的多控制框架，实现了跨多个控制模态的推理，在推理时能很好地泛化到多控制场景。

Abstract: While modern diffusion models excel at generating high-quality and diverse images, they still struggle with high-fidelity compositional and multimodal control, particularly when users simultaneously specify text prompts, subject references, spatial arrangements, pose constraints, and layout annotations. We introduce Canvas-to-Image, a unified framework that consolidates these heterogeneous controls into a single canvas interface, enabling users to generate images that faithfully reflect their intent. Our key idea is to encode diverse control signals into a single composite canvas image that the model can directly interpret for integrated visual-spatial reasoning. We further curate a suite of multi-task datasets and propose a Multi-Task Canvas Training strategy that optimizes the diffusion model to jointly understand and integrate heterogeneous controls into text-to-image generation within a unified learning paradigm. This joint training enables Canvas-to-Image to reason across multiple control modalities rather than relying on task-specific heuristics, and it generalizes well to multi-control scenarios during inference. Extensive experiments show that Canvas-to-Image significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity preservation and control adherence across challenging benchmarks, including multi-person composition, pose-controlled composition, layout-constrained generation, and multi-control generation.

TL;DR: 论文主张重新定义LLM效率，从追求大规模复杂技术转向注重简单性、可持续性和公平性，提出新的研究方向来降低LLM部署成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流LLM效率技术（MoE、推测解码、复杂RAG）只适用于拥有庞大基础设施的科技巨头，而普通机构无法受益，导致技术不平等和碳浪费问题。

Method: 提出新的研究议程：无需重新训练即可改造预训练模型架构、轻量级微调、经济推理、轻量知识管理，并采用Overhead-Aware Efficiency作为标准基准。

Result: 通过重新定义效率概念，将采用成本、可持续性和公平性纳入考量，可以促进LLM技术的民主化部署。

Conclusion: LLM效率优化的未来方向应该是简单性、可持续性和公平性，而非单纯追求大规模复杂技术，这样才能真正减少不平等和碳浪费。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become indispensable, but the most celebrated efficiency methods -- mixture-of-experts (MoE), speculative decoding, and complex retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) -- were built for hyperscale providers with vast infrastructure and elite teams. Outside that context, their benefits collapse into overhead, fragility, and wasted carbon. The result is that a handful of Big Tech companies benefit, while thousands of hospitals, schools, governments, and enterprises are left without viable options. We argue that the next frontier is not greater sophistication at scale, but robust simplicity: efficiency that thrives under modest resources and minimal expertise. We propose a new research agenda: retrofitting pretrained models with more efficient architectures without retraining, inventing lightweight fine-tuning that preserves alignment, making reasoning economical despite long chains of thought, enabling dynamic knowledge management without heavy RAG pipelines, and adopting Overhead-Aware Efficiency (OAE) as a standard benchmark. By redefining efficiency to include adoption cost, sustainability, and fairness, we can democratize LLM deployment -- ensuring that optimization reduces inequality and carbon waste rather than amplifying them.

Motivation: 开发一种不依赖统计共现或优化的透明高效嵌入方法，证明有意义的语义关系可以从确定性几何中产生。

Method: 将每个token的Unicode整数表示解析为谐波轨迹，建立符号与连续向量空间的双射可逆映射，通过几何对齐估计语义相似度。

Result: 在STS-B基准测试中达到Spearman相关性0.68，在10种语言中保持稳定性能，计算成本极低，每句对延迟低于毫秒级。

Conclusion: 确定性几何可以产生有意义的语义关系，为数据驱动嵌入提供了透明高效的替代方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Harmonic Token Projection (HTP), a reversible and deterministic framework for generating text embeddings without training, vocabularies, or stochastic parameters. Unlike neural embeddings that rely on statistical co-occurrence or optimization, HTP encodes each token analytically as a harmonic trajectory derived from its Unicode integer representation, establishing a bijective and interpretable mapping between discrete symbols and continuous vector space. The harmonic formulation provides phase-coherent projections that preserve both structure and reversibility, enabling semantic similarity estimation from purely geometric alignment. Experimental evaluation on the Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark (STS-B) and its multilingual extension shows that HTP achieves a Spearman correlation of \r{ho} = 0.68 in English, maintaining stable performance across ten languages with negligible computational cost and sub-millisecond latency per sentence pair. This demonstrates that meaningful semantic relations can emerge from deterministic geometry, offering a transparent and efficient alternative to data-driven embeddings. Keywords: Harmonic Token Projection, reversible embedding, deterministic encoding, semantic similarity, multilingual representation.

Result: 在8968个票证123个类别上，性能与SVM相当（层次F1: 0.731 vs 0.727），训练速度快5.9倍，增量更新快152倍，推理速度快8.6-8.8倍

Conclusion: 该方法适合生产环境，在保持性能的同时提供可解释性和操作效率

Abstract: Text classification with hierarchical taxonomies is a fundamental requirement in IT Service Management (ITSM) systems, where support tickets must be categorized into tree-structured taxonomies. We present a dual-embedding centroid-based classification framework that maintains separate semantic and lexical centroid representations per category, combining them through reciprocal rank fusion at inference time. The framework achieves performance competitive with Support Vector Machines (hierarchical F1: 0.731 vs 0.727) while providing interpretability through centroid representations. Evaluated on 8,968 ITSM tickets across 123 categories, this method achieves 5.9 times faster training and up to 152 times faster incremental updates. With 8.6-8.8 times speedup across batch sizes (100-1000 samples) when excluding embedding computation. These results make the method suitable for production ITSM environments prioritizing interpretability and operational efficiency.

Motivation: 传统判别式奖励模型数据效率低且容易受到奖励过优化的影响，需要改进训练方法来提升模型对齐人类偏好的效果。

Method: 采用三种策略：1) 将问答对重构为偏好指令；2) 聚合多样化偏好任务的奖励；3) 在不同dropout率下平均价值头输出以稳定奖励。

Conclusion: PIRA训练范式能够有效解决奖励模型的数据效率低和奖励过优化问题，提升模型与人类偏好的对齐效果。

Abstract: Reward models are crucial for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences but face two representative challenges. First, traditional discriminative reward models usually concatenate questions and responses directly as input, resulting in low data efficiency. Second, reward models are vulnerable to reward overoptimization. We propose PIRA, a training paradigm addressing these issues through three strategies: (1) Reformulating question-answer pairs into preference-based instructions for clearer and more explicit task specification, (2) aggregating rewards from diverse preference tasks to reduce bias and improve robustness, and (3) averaging value-head outputs under varying dropout rates to stabilize rewards. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of PIRA.

Despite this, they often struggle in specialized areas like law, mainly because they lack domain-specific pretraining. The legal field presents unique challenges, as legal documents are generally long and intricate, making it hard for models to process the full text efficiently. Previous studies have examined in-context approaches to address the knowledge gap, boosting model performance in new domains without full domain alignment. In our paper, we analyze model behavior on legal tasks by conducting experiments in three areas: (i) reorganizing documents based on rhetorical roles to assess how structured information affects long context processing and model decisions, (ii) defining rhetorical roles to familiarize the model with legal terminology, and (iii) emulating the step-by-step reasoning of courts regarding rhetorical roles to enhance model reasoning. These experiments are conducted in a zero-shot setting across three Indian legal judgment prediction datasets. Our results reveal that organizing data or explaining key legal terms significantly boosts model performance, with a minimum increase of ~1.5% and a maximum improvement of 4.36% in F1 score compared to the baseline.

TL;DR: 提出了MindSET数据集，这是一个来自Reddit的13M标注帖子的心理健康分析新基准，涵盖7种心理健康状况，通过严格预处理确保数据质量，在诊断检测任务中表现优于现有基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有心理健康分析基准数据集已过时，存在数据量有限、清洗不足、内容多样性（多语言和有害内容）等问题，需要新的高质量基准来支持社交媒体心理健康研究。

Method: 从Reddit收集自报告诊断数据，应用严格预处理（语言过滤、NSFW内容移除、去重），使用LIWC进行语言分析，并进行了基于微调语言模型和词袋特征的二元分类实验。

Result: MindSET包含超过1300万标注帖子，是之前基准的两倍多。在诊断检测实验中，使用MindSET训练的模型表现优于现有基准，自闭症检测F1得分提升高达18个百分点。

Conclusion: MindSET为社交媒体与心理健康交叉研究提供了坚实基础，支持早期风险检测和新兴心理趋势的深入分析。

Abstract: Social media data has become a vital resource for studying mental health, offering real-time insights into thoughts, emotions, and behaviors that traditional methods often miss. Progress in this area has been facilitated by benchmark datasets for mental health analysis; however, most existing benchmarks have become outdated due to limited data availability, inadequate cleaning, and the inherently diverse nature of social media content (e.g., multilingual and harmful material). We present a new benchmark dataset, \textbf{MindSET}, curated from Reddit using self-reported diagnoses to address these limitations. The annotated dataset contains over \textbf{13M} annotated posts across seven mental health conditions, more than twice the size of previous benchmarks. To ensure data quality, we applied rigorous preprocessing steps, including language filtering, and removal of Not Safe for Work (NSFW) and duplicate content. We further performed a linguistic analysis using LIWC to examine psychological term frequencies across the eight groups represented in the dataset. To demonstrate the dataset utility, we conducted binary classification experiments for diagnosis detection using both fine-tuned language models and Bag-of-Words (BoW) features. Models trained on MindSET consistently outperformed those trained on previous benchmarks, achieving up to an \textbf{18-point} improvement in F1 for Autism detection. Overall, MindSET provides a robust foundation for researchers exploring the intersection of social media and mental health, supporting both early risk detection and deeper analysis of emerging psychological trends.

TL;DR: FlexCode是一个流行度感知的生成推荐框架，通过自适应分配协作过滤和语义编码本的固定token预算，解决了现有方法使用单一编码本处理热门和长尾项目的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成推荐方法使用单一均匀编码本编码所有项目，忽视了热门项目（富含协作信号）和长尾项目（依赖语义理解）之间的固有不平衡，这种统一处理限制了表示效率并阻碍泛化能力。

Method: 引入FlexCode框架，自适应分配固定token预算到协作过滤编码本和语义编码本；使用轻量级MoE动态平衡CF精度和语义泛化；通过对齐和平滑目标在流行度谱系中保持一致性。

Result: 在公共和工业规模数据集上的实验表明，FlexCode始终优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: FlexCode为生成推荐器中的token表示提供了新机制，实现了更强的准确性和尾部鲁棒性，为基于token的推荐模型中平衡记忆和泛化提供了新视角。

Abstract: Generative recommendation has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm that unifies retrieval and generation, representing items as discrete semantic tokens and enabling flexible sequence modeling with autoregressive models. Despite its success, existing approaches rely on a single, uniform codebook to encode all items, overlooking the inherent imbalance between popular items rich in collaborative signals and long-tail items that depend on semantic understanding. We argue that this uniform treatment limits representational efficiency and hinders generalization. To address this, we introduce FlexCode, a popularity-aware framework that adaptively allocates a fixed token budget between a collaborative filtering (CF) codebook and a semantic codebook. A lightweight MoE dynamically balances CF-specific precision and semantic generalization, while an alignment and smoothness objective maintains coherence across the popularity spectrum. We perform experiments on both public and industrial-scale datasets, showing that FlexCode consistently outperform strong baselines. FlexCode provides a new mechanism for token representation in generative recommenders, achieving stronger accuracy and tail robustness, and offering a new perspective on balancing memorization and generalization in token-based recommendation models.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了首个阿拉伯语跨领域上下文相关文本到SQL数据集Ar-SParC，包含3,450个相关问题的序列，共10,225个问题及其SQL查询。使用GPT模型进行40个实验，开发了GAT校正器方法，在零样本和上下文学习设置下均提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前大多数文本到SQL的研究和数据集都是针对英语和中文的，阿拉伯语领域尚未有相关工作。为了填补这一空白，作者创建了首个阿拉伯语跨领域上下文相关文本到SQL数据集。

Method: 构建Ar-SParC数据集，包含3,450个相关问题的序列。使用GPT-3.5-turbo和GPT-4.5-turbo进行40个实验，应用10种不同的提示工程技术。开发了GAT校正器方法，并通过消融研究验证其有效性。

Result: GAT校正器在所有40个实验中均提升了性能：零样本设置下执行准确率(EX)平均提升1.9%，交互准确率(IX)平均提升1.9%；上下文学习设置下EX平均提升1.72%，IX平均提升0.92%。

Conclusion: Ar-SParC是首个阿拉伯语跨领域上下文相关文本到SQL数据集，GAT校正器方法在阿拉伯语文本到SQL任务中表现出色，特别适合阿拉伯语言特点。

Abstract: In recent years, the task of cross-domain, context-dependent text-to-SQL has received significant attention. Enables users with no prior knowledge of SQL to have a conversation with databases using natural language. However, most of the available datasets and research have been conducted in English, along with some work in Chinese. To this date, no effort has been made to address this task in the Arabic language. In this paper, we introduce Ar-SParC, the first Arabic cross-domain, context-dependent text-to-SQL dataset. The dataset consists of 3,450 sequences of interrelated questions, each sequence containing an average of approximately three questions, which results in a total of 10225 questions along with their corresponding SQL queries. We conducted 40 experiments on the Ar-SParC dataset using two large language models, GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4.5-turbo, applying 10 different prompt engineering techniques, including four question representation methods and six in-context learning techniques. Furthermore, we developed a novel approach named GAT corrector, which enhanced the performance across all 40 experiments, yielding an average improvement of 1.9% in execution accuracy (EX) and 1.9% in interaction accuracy (IX) under zero-shot settings, and an average increase of 1.72% EX and 0.92% IX under in-context learning settings. Finally, we conducted an ablation study with two more experiments to explain why the GAT corrector outperformed the previous GAT verifier technique, particularly for the Arabic language.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在临床基准测试中表现良好，但它们可能通过错误推理得出正确结论，这种失败模式在肿瘤学决策支持中具有安全影响，而基于准确性的评估无法捕捉到这一点。

Method: 开发了一个层次化的推理错误分类法，从GPT-4对真实肿瘤学笔记的思维链响应中提取，并在前列腺癌咨询笔记上进行验证，模拟提取、分析和临床推荐任务。

Result: 23%的解释中存在推理错误，确认偏差和锚定偏差最常见。推理失败与指南不一致和潜在有害建议相关，特别是在晚期疾病管理中。自动化评估器能检测错误存在但无法可靠分类子类型。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在推理存在缺陷时可能提供流畅但临床不安全的建议。该分类法为临床部署前评估和改进推理保真度提供了可推广的框架。

Abstract: Despite high performance on clinical benchmarks, large language models may reach correct conclusions through faulty reasoning, a failure mode with safety implications for oncology decision support that is not captured by accuracy-based evaluation. In this two-cohort retrospective study, we developed a hierarchical taxonomy of reasoning errors from GPT-4 chain-of-thought responses to real oncology notes and tested its clinical relevance. Using breast and pancreatic cancer notes from the CORAL dataset, we annotated 600 reasoning traces to define a three-tier taxonomy mapping computational failures to cognitive bias frameworks. We validated the taxonomy on 822 responses from prostate cancer consult notes spanning localized through metastatic disease, simulating extraction, analysis, and clinical recommendation tasks. Reasoning errors occurred in 23 percent of interpretations and dominated overall errors, with confirmation bias and anchoring bias most common. Reasoning failures were associated with guideline-discordant and potentially harmful recommendations, particularly in advanced disease management. Automated evaluators using state-of-the-art language models detected error presence but could not reliably classify subtypes. These findings show that large language models may provide fluent but clinically unsafe recommendations when reasoning is flawed. The taxonomy provides a generalizable framework for evaluating and improving reasoning fidelity before clinical deployment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出动态模板选择(DTS)方法，根据查询复杂度自适应选择响应模板，在保持响应质量的同时显著降低token成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型部署采用统一的提示策略，对复杂分析任务和简单事实问题都使用冗长的响应模式，导致token效率低下，而输出token成本比输入token高4-8倍。

Method: 比较了两种路由方法：使用预计算嵌入的简单MLP和微调的RoBERTa变换器，通过MMLU数据集进行评估。

Result: MLP路由在测试数据上达到90.5%的路由准确率，略高于RoBERTa(89.5%)，但参数少1.25亿。在三个主要LLM提供商上验证，token减少32.6%-33.9%。

Conclusion: 动态模板选择能有效降低token成本，路由决策在不同提供商间具有通用性，为LLM部署提供了成本优化的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Contemporary large language model deployments typically employ uniform prompting strategies across diverse query types, applying verbose response patterns to both complex analytical tasks and straightforward factual questions. This one-size-fits-all methodology leads to substantial token inefficiency, a concern amplified by the significant cost differential between input and output tokens--the latter commanding 4-8x higher prices across major providers. We present Dynamic Template Selection (DTS), which adaptively matches response templates to query complexity, achieving significant cost reductions without compromising response quality.
  We compared two routing approaches: a simple MLP that uses pre-computed embeddings and a more complex fine-tuned RoBERTa transformer. Through comprehensive evaluation on 1,000 MMLU questions, we find that the MLP router achieves 90.5% routing accuracy on held-out test data, marginally exceeding RoBERTa's performance (89.5%) despite utilizing 125M fewer parameters. Notably, our empirical analysis reveals provider-agnostic behavior in template selection--routing decisions generalize effectively across 3 major LLM providers (OpenAI GPT-4, Google Gemini, and Anthropic Claude), as validated through 9,000 production API calls. While routing accuracy remains consistent at 90.5% across providers, observed token reductions vary from 32.6% to 33.9%, reflecting provider-specific generation characteristics.
  This work contributes several key elements: formal problem formulation with theoretical grounding in machine learning, four algorithms with corresponding complexity analyses, and extensive empirical validation across production systems.

Motivation: 现有记忆化定义存在不足，无法全面捕捉大语言模型中的训练数据记忆现象，尤其是在对齐模型中，这带来了隐私和版权风险。

Method: 引入多前缀记忆框架，核心观点是记忆序列深度编码，可通过大量不同前缀检索。定义序列被记忆的条件是外部对抗搜索能找到足够数量的不同前缀来引出该序列。

Result: 实验表明，多前缀定义能可靠区分记忆化和非记忆化数据，为审计LLM数据泄露提供了稳健实用的工具。

Conclusion: 多前缀记忆框架提供了一个更全面、实用的方法来识别和量化语言模型中的记忆化现象，有助于解决隐私和版权问题。

Abstract: Large language models, trained on massive corpora, are prone to verbatim memorization of training data, creating significant privacy and copyright risks. While previous works have proposed various definitions for memorization, many exhibit shortcomings in comprehensively capturing this phenomenon, especially in aligned models. To address this, we introduce a novel framework: multi-prefix memorization. Our core insight is that memorized sequences are deeply encoded and thus retrievable via a significantly larger number of distinct prefixes than non-memorized content. We formalize this by defining a sequence as memorized if an external adversarial search can identify a target count of distinct prefixes that elicit it. This framework shifts the focus from single-path extraction to quantifying the robustness of a memory, measured by the diversity of its retrieval paths. Through experiments on open-source and aligned chat models, we demonstrate that our multi-prefix definition reliably distinguishes memorized from non-memorized data, providing a robust and practical tool for auditing data leakage in LLMs.

Conclusion: SAGE框架通过主动的、基于智能体的方法，有效提升了稀疏自编码器特征解释的质量和可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their internal mechanisms remain largely opaque, posing a significant challenge to their safe and reliable deployment. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising tool for decomposing LLM representations into more interpretable features, but explaining the features captured by SAEs remains a challenging task. In this work, we propose SAGE (SAE AGentic Explainer), an agent-based framework that recasts feature interpretation from a passive, single-pass generation task into an active, explanation-driven process. SAGE implements a rigorous methodology by systematically formulating multiple explanations for each feature, designing targeted experiments to test them, and iteratively refining explanations based on empirical activation feedback. Experiments on features from SAEs of diverse language models demonstrate that SAGE produces explanations with significantly higher generative and predictive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art baselines.an agent-based framework that recasts feature interpretation from a passive, single-pass generation task into an active, explanationdriven process.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了DSPy+HELM框架，通过结构化提示方法（包括推理引导）来更准确地评估语言模型性能。研究发现传统HELM基准会低估模型性能4%，导致排行榜排名错误，而引入推理能减少对提示设计的敏感性。

Motivation: 现有基准测试框架如HELM依赖固定提示，无法跨模型泛化，导致性能估计不准确。需要估计每个语言模型的上限性能，避免低估其真实能力。

Method: 开发了可复现的DSPy+HELM框架，使用四种提示方法评估四个前沿语言模型在七个基准测试上的表现，并与现有HELM基线进行比较。

Result: 研究发现：HELM低估语言模型性能4%；性能估计在不同基准间差异更大；排行榜排名在3/7基准上发生反转；引入推理能降低对提示设计的敏感性。

Conclusion: 这是首个大规模实证研究，表明可扩展的性能上限估计能创建更有决策价值的基准测试，开源了DSPy+HELM集成和提示优化流程。

Abstract: As language models (LMs) are increasingly adopted across domains, high-quality benchmarking frameworks that accurately estimate performance are essential for guiding deployment decisions. While frameworks such as Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM) enable broad evaluation across tasks, they often rely on fixed prompts that fail to generalize across LMs, yielding unrepresentative performance estimates. Unless we estimate each LM's ceiling (maximum achievable via changes to the prompt), we risk underestimating performance. Declarative prompting frameworks, such as DSPy, offer a scalable alternative to manual prompt engineering by crafting structured prompts that can be optimized per task. However, such frameworks have not been systematically evaluated across established benchmarks. We present a reproducible DSPy+HELM framework that introduces structured prompting methods which elicit reasoning, enabling more accurate LM benchmarking. Using four prompting methods, we evaluate four frontier LMs across seven benchmarks (general/medical domain) against existing HELM baseline scores. We find that without structured prompting: (i) HELM underestimates LM performance (by 4% average), (ii) performance estimates vary more across benchmarks (+2% standard deviation), (iii) performance gaps are misrepresented (leaderboard rankings flip on 3/7 benchmarks), and (iv) introducing reasoning (chain-of-thought) reduces LM sensitivity to prompt design (smaller Δ across prompts). To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale benchmarking study to empirically characterize LM behavior across benchmarks and prompting methods, showing that scalable performance ceiling estimation enables more decision-useful benchmarks. We open-source (i) DSPy+HELM Integration (https://github.com/stanford-crfm/helm/pull/3893) and (ii) Prompt Optimization Pipeline (https://github.com/StanfordMIMI/dspy-helm).

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Length-MAX的新分词器，通过最小化平均字符数来减少训练和推理所需的token数量，相比BPE在10K-50K词汇量下减少14-18%的token，训练步骤减少17-18%，推理延迟降低13-14%，同时提升下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分词器如BPE主要基于频率优化，但未充分考虑token长度对效率的影响。本文旨在通过优化平均token长度来提高语言模型的训练和推理效率。

Method: 将长度加权目标最大化建模为图划分问题，开发贪心近似算法来获取词汇表，构建Length-MAX分词器。

Result: 在FineWeb和多个领域上，相比BPE减少14-18%的token；GPT-2模型训练步骤减少17-18%；推理延迟降低13-14%；下游任务LAMBADA困惑度降低11.7%，HellaSwag准确率提升4.3%；词汇覆盖率达99.62%。

Conclusion: 优化平均token长度而非仅频率，可有效提高语言模型效率而不牺牲下游性能，且兼容生产系统，推理时减少18%的嵌入和KV缓存内存。

Abstract: We introduce a new tokenizer for language models that minimizes the average tokens per character, thereby reducing the number of tokens needed to represent text during training and to generate text during inference. Our method, which we refer to as the Length-MAX tokenizer, obtains its vocabulary by casting a length-weighted objective maximization as a graph partitioning problem and developing a greedy approximation algorithm. On FineWeb and diverse domains, it yields 14--18\% fewer tokens than Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) across vocabulary sizes from 10K to 50K, and the reduction is 13.0\% when the size is 64K. Training GPT-2 models at 124M, 355M, and 1.3B parameters from scratch with five runs each shows 18.5\%, 17.2\%, and 18.5\% fewer steps, respectively, to reach a fixed validation loss, and 13.7\%, 12.7\%, and 13.7\% lower inference latency, together with a 16\% throughput gain at 124M, while consistently improving on downstream tasks including reducing LAMBADA perplexity by 11.7\% and enhancing HellaSwag accuracy by 4.3\%. Moreover, the Length-MAX tokenizer achieves 99.62\% vocabulary coverage and the out-of-vocabulary rate remains low at 0.12\% on test sets. These results demonstrate that optimizing for average token length, rather than frequency alone, offers an effective approach to more efficient language modeling without sacrificing -- and often improving -- downstream performance. The tokenizer is compatible with production systems and reduces embedding and KV-cache memory by 18\% at inference.

Abstract: Statefulness is essential for large language model (LLM) agents to perform long-term planning and problem-solving. This makes memory a critical component, yet its management and evolution remain largely underexplored. Existing evaluations mostly focus on static conversational settings, where memory is passively retrieved from dialogue to answer queries, overlooking the dynamic ability to accumulate and reuse experience across evolving task streams. In real-world environments such as interactive problem assistants or embodied agents, LLMs are required to handle continuous task streams, yet often fail to learn from accumulated interactions, losing valuable contextual insights, a limitation that calls for test-time evolution, where LLMs retrieve, integrate, and update memory continuously during deployment. To bridge this gap, we introduce Evo-Memory, a comprehensive streaming benchmark and framework for evaluating self-evolving memory in LLM agents. Evo-Memory structures datasets into sequential task streams, requiring LLMs to search, adapt, and evolve memory after each interaction. We unify and implement over ten representative memory modules and evaluate them across 10 diverse multi-turn goal-oriented and single-turn reasoning and QA datasets. To better benchmark experience reuse, we provide a baseline method, ExpRAG, for retrieving and utilizing prior experience, and further propose ReMem, an action-think-memory refine pipeline that tightly integrates reasoning, task actions, and memory updates to achieve continual improvement.

Abstract: Argument mining is a subfield of natural language processing to identify and extract the argument components, like premises and conclusions, within a text and to recognize the relations between them. It reveals the logical structure of texts to be used in tasks like knowledge extraction. This paper aims at utilizing a cross-lingual approach to argument mining for low-resource languages, by constructing three training scenarios. We examine the models on English, as a high-resource language, and Persian, as a low-resource language. To this end, we evaluate the models based on the English Microtext corpus \citep{PeldszusStede2015}, and its parallel Persian translation. The learning scenarios are as follow: (i) zero-shot transfer, where the model is trained solely with the English data, (ii) English-only training enhanced by synthetic examples generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), and (iii) a cross-lingual model that combines the original English data with manually translated Persian sentences. The zero-shot transfer model attains F1 scores of 50.2\% on the English test set and 50.7\% on the Persian test set. LLM-based augmentation model improves the performance up to 59.2\% on English and 69.3\% on Persian. The cross-lingual model, trained on both languages but evaluated solely on the Persian test set, surpasses the LLM-based variant, by achieving a F1 of 74.8\%. Results indicate that a lightweight cross-lingual blend can outperform considerably the more resource-intensive augmentation pipelines, and it offers a practical pathway for the argument mining task to overcome data resource shortage on low-resource languages.

Conclusion: LLM形成紧凑、因果隔离的抽象语义结构机制，这些机制在不同规模和架构间存在部分迁移。

Abstract: Despite displaying semantic competence, large language models' internal mechanisms that ground abstract semantic structure remain insufficiently characterised. We propose a method integrating role-cross minimal pairs, temporal emergence analysis, and cross-model comparison to study how LLMs implement semantic roles. Our analysis uncovers: (i) highly concentrated circuits (89-94% attribution within 28 nodes); (ii) gradual structural refinement rather than phase transitions, with larger models sometimes bypassing localised circuits; and (iii) moderate cross-scale conservation (24-59% component overlap) alongside high spectral similarity. These findings suggest that LLMs form compact, causally isolated mechanisms for abstract semantic structure, and these mechanisms exhibit partial transfer across scales and architectures.

TL;DR: Chatty-KG是一个用于知识图谱对话问答的多智能体系统，结合了RAG式检索和结构化SPARQL查询执行，在单轮和多轮对话中都显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在局限性：LLM无法直接访问私有动态知识图谱，RAG系统会序列化图结构且难以处理多轮上下文，传统KGQA系统仅支持单轮问答且延迟高。

Method: 采用模块化多智能体架构，通过任务专用LLM智能体协作实现上下文解释、对话跟踪、实体关系链接和高效查询规划，将自然语言问题转换为可执行的SPARQL查询。

Result: 在大型多样化知识图谱上的实验显示，Chatty-KG在单轮和多轮设置下均显著优于最先进基线方法，获得更高的F1和P@1分数。

Conclusion: Chatty-KG统一了对话灵活性和结构化知识图谱基础，为可靠的多轮KGQA提供了可扩展和可扩展的方法，无需微调或预处理即可支持演进的知识图谱。

Abstract: Conversational Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs (KGs) combines the factual grounding of KG-based QA with the interactive nature of dialogue systems. KGs are widely used in enterprise and domain applications to provide structured, evolving, and reliable knowledge. Large language models (LLMs) enable natural and context-aware conversations, but lack direct access to private and dynamic KGs. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems can retrieve graph content but often serialize structure, struggle with multi-turn context, and require heavy indexing. Traditional KGQA systems preserve structure but typically support only single-turn QA, incur high latency, and struggle with coreference and context tracking. To address these limitations, we propose Chatty-KG, a modular multi-agent system for conversational QA over KGs. Chatty-KG combines RAG-style retrieval with structured execution by generating SPARQL queries through task-specialized LLM agents. These agents collaborate for contextual interpretation, dialogue tracking, entity and relation linking, and efficient query planning, enabling accurate and low-latency translation of natural questions into executable queries. Experiments on large and diverse KGs show that Chatty-KG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both single-turn and multi-turn settings, achieving higher F1 and P@1 scores. Its modular design preserves dialogue coherence and supports evolving KGs without fine-tuning or pre-processing. Evaluations with commercial (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0) and open-weight (e.g., Phi-4, Gemma 3) LLMs confirm broad compatibility and stable performance. Overall, Chatty-KG unifies conversational flexibility with structured KG grounding, offering a scalable and extensible approach for reliable multi-turn KGQA.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs在定义类问题上表现最佳，但在举例类问题上表现最差，且对高频知识的复述倾向更强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在除定义类查询外的其他类型问题上的性能下降，研究预训练数据对LLMs回答多样化语言查询的影响。

Method: 使用TrackList分析管道和RefoMed-EN数据集，通过句法语义相似度、统计相关性和嵌入等方法评估LLM输出质量。

Result: LLMs在定义类问题上的任务性能最高，举例类问题最低；对于定义类问题，LLMs更倾向于复述流行和频繁的知识，而对尾部和技术知识复述较少。

Conclusion: LLMs在处理非定义类查询时存在性能差距，特别是在专业文本中，对技术知识的处理能力有限。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven efficient in giving definition-type answers to user input queries. While for humans giving various types of answers, such as examples and paraphrases, is an easy task, LLMs struggle to provide correct answers for other than definition-type queries. In this study, we evaluated this drop in performance using TrackList, a fine-grained linguistic and statistical analysis pipeline to investigate the impact of the pre-training data on LLMs answers to diverse linguistic queries. We also introduce RefoMed-EN, an English dataset consisting of 6170 human-annotated medical terms alongside their corresponding definitions, denominations, exemplifications, explanations, or paraphrases. We studied whether the high frequency of a concept (head) or low frequency (tail) impacts the language model's performance. We evaluated the quality of the LLM's output using syntactic and semantic similarity metrics, statistical correlations and embeddings. Results showed that the LLM's task performance for definition type questions is the highest, while for the exemplification type it is the lowest. Additionally, we showed that for definition-type questions, large language models are prone to paraphrase more on popular and frequent knowledge and less on tail and technical knowledge, especially in the expert texts.

### [138] [Semantic Anchors in In-Context Learning: Why Small LLMs Cannot Flip Their Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21038)
*Anantha Padmanaban Krishna Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究表明上下文学习无法覆盖预训练的标签语义，而是主要调整输入如何映射到预训练期间学习的稳定语义方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究上下文学习是否能覆盖预训练标签语义，还是仅仅细化已有的语义骨干。

Method: 将LLMs视为提示诱导分类器，对比自然演示（正确标签）和反转演示（系统翻转标签含义）下的行为，引入语义覆盖率和三个对齐指标。

Result: 在8个分类任务和8个开源LLMs上，发现上下文学习无法学习连贯的反语义分类器，语义覆盖率在少样本设置中保持为零。

Conclusion: 上下文学习主要调整输入在稳定语义方向上的投影，而非灵活重映射标签含义，表明覆盖标签语义需要超越上下文学习的干预措施。

Abstract: Can in-context learning (ICL) override pre-trained label semantics, or does it merely refine an existing semantic backbone? We address this question by treating LLMs as prompt-induced classifiers and contrasting their behavior under \emph{natural} demonstrations (with correct labels) and \emph{inverted} demonstrations (systematically flipping label meanings). We decompose ICL behavior into three alignment metrics (truth, prior, and prompt alignment) and introduce a semantic override rate, defined as correctness under flipped semantics. Across eight classification tasks and eight open-source LLMs (1--12B parameters), we find consistent evidence for a semantic anchor view. With natural demonstrations, ICL improves accuracy while maintaining strong prior alignment; most correct predictions coincide with zero-shot behavior, even when the prior is weak. With inverted demonstrations, models cannot learn coherent anti-semantic classifiers: prompt alignment increases only by sacrificing accuracy, and semantic override rates remain exactly zero in our few-shot 1--12B setting. Rather than flexibly remapping label meanings, ICL primarily adjusts how inputs project onto stable semantic directions learned during pre-training, clarifying fundamental limits of few-shot prompting and suggesting that overriding label semantics at these scales requires interventions beyond ICL.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合检索上下文信息的讽刺检测方法，通过外部知识检索和模型内部知识提取两种策略，显著提升了LLMs在讽刺检测任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 讽刺检测在NLP中仍然具有挑战性，现有PLMs和LLMs在处理复杂讽刺文本时表现不佳，特别是面对语言多样性和文化差异时。模型缺乏必要的背景知识导致检测不可靠。

Method: 基于PMP方法，引入检索感知方法：1) 非参数知识检索：当模型缺乏背景时添加基于网络的检索信息；2) 自知识感知策略：激发模型内部知识。在三个数据集上进行评估。

Result: 非参数检索在Twitter Indonesia Sarcastic数据集上比原始PMP方法提升9.87% macro-F1；自知识检索在Semeval和MUStARD上分别提升3.29%和4.08% macro-F1。

Conclusion: 上下文信息对提升LLMs在讽刺检测任务中的性能至关重要，特别是涉及文化特定俚语、引用或LLMs未知术语时。未来工作将优化相关上下文信息的检索质量。

Abstract: Detecting sarcasm remains a challenging task in the areas of Natural Language Processing (NLP) despite recent advances in neural network approaches. Currently, Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) are the preferred approach for sarcasm detection. However, the complexity of sarcastic text, combined with linguistic diversity and cultural variation across communities, has made the task more difficult even for PLMs and LLMs. Beyond that, those models also exhibit unreliable detection of words or tokens that require extra grounding for analysis. Building on a state-of-the-art prompting method in LLMs for sarcasm detection called Pragmatic Metacognitive Prompting (PMP), we introduce a retrieval-aware approach that incorporates retrieved contextual information for each target text. Our pipeline explores two complementary ways to provide context: adding non-parametric knowledge using web-based retrieval when the model lacks necessary background, and eliciting the model's own internal knowledge for a self-knowledge awareness strategy. We evaluated our approach with three datasets, such as Twitter Indonesia Sarcastic, SemEval-2018 Task 3, and MUStARD. Non-parametric retrieval resulted in a significant 9.87% macro-F1 improvement on Twitter Indonesia Sarcastic compared to the original PMP method. Self-knowledge retrieval improves macro-F1 by 3.29% on Semeval and by 4.08% on MUStARD. These findings highlight the importance of context in enhancing LLMs performance in sarcasm detection task, particularly the involvement of culturally specific slang, references, or unknown terms to the LLMs. Future work will focus on optimizing the retrieval of relevant contextual information and examining how retrieval quality affects performance.

*Thura Aung,Eaint Kay Khaing Kyaw,Ye Kyaw Thu,Thazin Myint Oo,Thepchai Supnithi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 在缅甸语等低资源语言分类任务中，使用Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs)作为分类头替代传统的MLPs，在多种嵌入表示上表现出竞争力或更优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言分类任务通常只微调最终分类层，而保持预训练编码器权重冻结。传统MLPs的固定非线性限制了表达能力并增加了计算成本，因此探索KANs作为替代方案。

Method: 评估了三种KAN变体：基于傅里叶的FourierKAN、基于样条的EfficientKAN和基于网格的FasterKAN，在多种嵌入表示（TF-IDF、fastText、多语言transformers）上进行实验。

Result: KAN-based分类头与MLPs竞争或更优：EfficientKAN与fastText组合获得最高F1分数（0.928），FasterKAN在速度和准确性之间提供最佳权衡。在transformer嵌入上，EfficientKAN与mBERT匹配或略微优于MLPs（0.917 F1）。

Conclusion: KANs是MLPs在低资源语言分类中的表达能力强、高效的替代方案。

Abstract: In low-resource languages like Burmese, classification tasks often fine-tune only the final classification layer, keeping pre-trained encoder weights frozen. While Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) are commonly used, their fixed non-linearity can limit expressiveness and increase computational cost. This work explores Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as alternative classification heads, evaluating Fourier-based FourierKAN, Spline-based EfficientKAN, and Grid-based FasterKAN-across diverse embeddings including TF-IDF, fastText, and multilingual transformers (mBERT, Distil-mBERT). Experimental results show that KAN-based heads are competitive with or superior to MLPs. EfficientKAN with fastText achieved the highest F1-score (0.928), while FasterKAN offered the best trade-off between speed and accuracy. On transformer embeddings, EfficientKAN matched or slightly outperformed MLPs with mBERT (0.917 F1). These findings highlight KANs as expressive, efficient alternatives to MLPs for low-resource language classification.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文评估了28种不同架构的大语言模型在58个需要字符级约束满足的单词谜题上的表现，发现架构差异比参数规模扩展对约束满足能力的影响更大，模型在处理拼写异常但约束有效的模式时存在系统性失败。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在受控文本生成中必须满足硬性拼写约束，但目前缺乏跨架构的系统性评估。研究旨在了解不同模型架构在字符级约束满足任务上的表现差异。

Method: 评估了三个模型家族（Qwen3、Claude Haiku-4.5、GPT-5-mini）共28种配置在58个单词谜题上的表现，使用10,000名人类解谜者的难度评级作为基准。

Result: 架构差异产生的性能差距（2.0-2.2倍，F1=0.761 vs. 0.343）远大于家族内参数规模扩展的收益（83%增益）。模型在拼写异常的常见词上存在系统性失败（人类成功率86-95%，模型失败率89-96%）。

Conclusion: 约束满足可能需要专门的架构特征或训练目标，而不仅仅是标准语言模型扩展。模型过度依赖分布合理性，惩罚了拼写异常但约束有效的模式，表明需要超越简单参数扩展的架构创新。

Abstract: Large language models must satisfy hard orthographic constraints during controlled text generation, yet systematic cross-architecture evaluation remains limited. We evaluate 28 configurations spanning three model families (Qwen3, Claude Haiku-4.5, GPT-5-mini) on 58 word puzzles requiring character-level constraint satisfaction. Architectural differences produce substantially larger performance gaps (2.0-2.2x, F1=0.761 vs. 0.343) than parameter scaling within families (83% gain from eightfold scaling), suggesting that constraint satisfaction may require specialized architectural features or training objectives beyond standard language model scaling. Thinking budget sensitivity proves heterogeneous: high-capacity models show strong returns (+0.102 to +0.136 F1), while mid-sized variants saturate or degrade. These patterns are inconsistent with uniform compute benefits. Using difficulty ratings from 10,000 human solvers per puzzle, we establish modest but consistent calibration (r=0.24-0.38) across all families, yet identify systematic failures on common words with unusual orthography ("data", "poop", "loll": 86-95% human success, 89-96% model miss rate). These failures reveal over-reliance on distributional plausibility that penalizes orthographically atypical but constraint-valid patterns, suggesting architectural innovations may be required beyond simply scaling parameters or computational budgets.

Result: 提出的AEC模型将ASR模型的平均WER从51.56降至39.82（增强前）和43.59（增强后），chrF++分数从0.5864提升至0.627。

Conclusion: 结果证明了AEC的鲁棒性，以及在低资源环境中特征设计对改善ASR输出的重要性。

Abstract: This paper investigates sequence-to-sequence Transformer models for automatic speech recognition (ASR) error correction in low-resource Burmese, focusing on different feature integration strategies including IPA and alignment information. To our knowledge, this is the first study addressing ASR error correction specifically for Burmese. We evaluate five ASR backbones and show that our ASR Error Correction (AEC) approaches consistently improve word- and character-level accuracy over baseline outputs. The proposed AEC model, combining IPA and alignment features, reduced the average WER of ASR models from 51.56 to 39.82 before augmentation (and 51.56 to 43.59 after augmentation) and improving chrF++ scores from 0.5864 to 0.627, demonstrating consistent gains over the baseline ASR outputs without AEC. Our results highlight the robustness of AEC and the importance of feature design for improving ASR outputs in low-resource settings.

Conclusion: 双专家架构结合指令残差技术有效解决了专业领域大语言模型在保持指令跟随能力的同时增强领域知识的挑战，在抵押贷款金融领域取得了显著性能提升。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional capabilities across general domains, yet their application to specialized sectors such as mortgage finance requires domain-specific knowledge augmentation while preserving instruction-following fidelity. We present MortgageLLM, a novel domain-specific large language model that addresses this dual challenge. It is developed using a dual-track specialization framework from a single base model (LLaMA-3.1-8B). We opted for this dual-expert approach as a single multi-task model suffers from performance trade-offs, where optimizing for structured tasks (via SFT) degrades conversational fidelity (via DPO). Our dual-track method solves this by creating two specialists, allowing each to be optimally trained for its distinct capability. Our approach applies the instruction residual technique to restore instruction-following capabilities post-domain adaptation without supervised fine-tuning. We contribute: (1) application of this residual technique to the highly specialized mortgage finance domain; (2) a dual-expert architecture combining a conversational Q&A model and a structured task model for classification and summarization; and (3) an intelligent task routing mechanism using few-shot classification performed by one of the expert models itself. We validate our approach on domain-specific benchmarks, where our final model (MLM v2) significantly outperforms the base LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct, achieving an LLM-as-a-Judge summarization score of 4.58 (vs. 3.99), a Q&A score of 4.09 (vs. 4.0), and a classification score of 2.6 (vs. 1.2). On semantic similarity, our model achieved a BERTScore of 0.77 for summarization (vs. 0.74), 0.68 for Q&A (vs. 0.58), and 0.75 for classification (vs. 0.73), substantially outperforming baseline approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理模型在复杂推理任务中表现出色，但其面对对抗性越狱提示时的安全性仍面临挑战。这类提示具有隐蔽性和欺骗性，能绕过内置安全机制导致有害内容生成，需要自适应安全对齐方法。

Method: SGASA框架包含两个关键阶段：数据预合成（生成安全准则和增强提示）和对齐微调（使用监督微调和直接偏好优化将准则嵌入模型）。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，SGASA显著提高了模型安全性，验证了其自适应和可扩展的有效性。

Conclusion: SGASA框架通过内部化模型生成的安全准则，有效增强了模型对抗有害对抗性提示的鲁棒性，同时最小化对良性请求的不必要拒绝。

Abstract: Reasoning models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks. However, ensuring their safety against adversarial jailbreak prompts remains a critical challenge. Due to the covert and deceptive nature of such prompts, they can often evade built-in safety mechanisms and lead to the generation of harmful content. This underscores the need for an adaptive safety alignment approach that enables models to autonomously reinforce their defenses in response to adversarial inputs. This paper introduces the Synthesized Guideline-based Adaptive Safety Alignment (SGASA) framework, which internalizes model-generated safety guidelines to strengthen models' ability to enhance robustness against harmful adversarial prompts while minimizing unnecessary refusals of benign requests. SGASA consists of two key stages: Data Pre-synthesis, which generates safety guidelines and augmented prompts; and Alignment Fine-tuning, which leverages Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to embed these guidelines into the model. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that SGASA significantly improves model safety, validating its adaptive and scalable effectiveness.

TL;DR: 研究表明，在少量人类调查数据上微调LLM可以改善模拟结果的异质性、对齐性和信念-行为一致性，但即使最佳微调模型也无法复现原始研究的回归系数，因此LLM生成的数据仍不适合替代人类参与者进行正式推断分析。

Method: 使用信息披露行为实验，比较人类和LLM生成的反应，评估分布差异、子群体对齐、信念-行为一致性和回归系数恢复等多个维度。

Result: 在少量人类样本上微调显著改善了异质性、对齐性和信念-行为一致性，但无法复现原始研究的回归系数。

Conclusion: LLM生成的数据不适合替代人类参与者进行正式推断分析，尽管微调可以改善某些方面的模拟效果。

Abstract: There is ongoing debate about whether large language models (LLMs) can serve as substitutes for human participants in survey and experimental research. While recent work in fields such as marketing and psychology has explored the potential of LLM-based simulation, a growing body of evidence cautions against this practice: LLMs often fail to align with real human behavior, exhibiting limited diversity, systematic misalignment for minority subgroups, insufficient within-group variance, and discrepancies between stated beliefs and actions. This study examines an important and distinct question in this domain: whether fine-tuning on a small subset of human survey data, such as that obtainable from a pilot study, can mitigate these issues and yield realistic simulated outcomes. Using a behavioral experiment on information disclosure, we compare human and LLM-generated responses across multiple dimensions, including distributional divergence, subgroup alignment, belief-action coherence, and the recovery of regression coefficients. We find that fine-tuning on small human samples substantially improves heterogeneity, alignment, and belief-action coherence relative to the base model. However, even the best-performing fine-tuned models fail to reproduce the regression coefficients of the original study, suggesting that LLM-generated data remain unsuitable for replacing human participants in formal inferential analyses.

Conclusion: 通过发布这一开放式资源，旨在促进包容性AI发展，支持对代表性不足语言的研究，并为解决对话语音建模中的语言和技术挑战提供基础。

Abstract: This paper introduces the development of the first open conversational speech dataset for the Isan language, the most widely spoken regional dialect in Thailand. Unlike existing speech corpora that are primarily based on read or scripted speech, this dataset consists of natural speech, thereby capturing authentic linguistic phenomena such as colloquials, spontaneous prosody, disfluencies, and frequent code-switching with central Thai. A key challenge in building this resource lies in the lack of a standardized orthography for Isan. Current writing practices vary considerably, due to the different lexical tones between Thai and Isan. This variability complicates the design of transcription guidelines and poses questions regarding consistency, usability, and linguistic authenticity. To address these issues, we establish practical transcription protocols that balance the need for representational accuracy with the requirements of computational processing. By releasing this dataset as an open resource, we aim to contribute to inclusive AI development, support research on underrepresented languages, and provide a basis for addressing the linguistic and technical challenges inherent in modeling conversational speech.

Result: 建立了全面的PEFT方法评估框架，能够系统比较不同PEFT方法的性能表现和效率权衡。

Conclusion: PEFT-Bench填补了当前PEFT方法评估的空白，提供了可复现的统一评估标准，有助于更全面地理解和选择适合的PEFT方法。

Abstract: Despite the state-of-the-art performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) achieved on many tasks, their massive scale often leads to high computational and environmental costs, limiting their accessibility. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods address this challenge by reducing the number of trainable parameters while maintaining strong downstream performance. Despite the increased development in PEFT methods, current evaluations remain limited (in terms of evaluated models and datasets) and difficult to reproduce. To bridge this gap, we introduce PEFT-Bench, a unified end-to-end benchmark for evaluating diverse PEFT methods on autoregressive LLMs. We demonstrate its usage across 27 NLP datasets and 6 PEFT methods. To account for different PEFT training and inference factors, we also introduce the PEFT Soft Score Penalties (PSCP) metric, which takes trainable parameters, inference speed, and training memory usage into account.

Motivation: 探究神经网络语言模型在训练过程中是否以及如何发展出符合人类语言规律的特征，特别是Martin定律这种词频与多义性的经验关系。

Method: 使用DBSCAN聚类上下文嵌入来操作化词义，分析4个Pythia模型（70M-1B参数）在30个训练检查点上的表现。

Result: Martin定律在检查点100左右出现，在104达到峰值相关（r>0.6），在105下降；小模型在后期出现灾难性语义崩溃，大模型则呈现优雅退化；频率-特异性权衡在所有模型中保持稳定（r≈-0.3）。

Conclusion: 语言模型对语言规律的遵循并非随训练单调增加，而是遵循平衡轨迹，存在最佳语义窗口；建立了评估神经网络语言模型中涌现语言结构的新方法。

Abstract: We present the first systematic investigation of Martin's Law - the empirical relationship between word frequency and polysemy - in text generated by neural language models during training. Using DBSCAN clustering of contextualized embeddings as an operationalization of word senses, we analyze four Pythia models (70M-1B parameters) across 30 training checkpoints. Our results reveal a non-monotonic developmental trajectory: Martin's Law emerges around checkpoint 100, reaches peak correlation (r > 0.6) at checkpoint 104, then degrades by checkpoint 105. Smaller models (70M, 160M) experience catastrophic semantic collapse at late checkpoints, while larger models (410M, 1B) show graceful degradation. The frequency-specificity trade-off remains stable (r $\approx$ -0.3) across all models. These findings suggest that compliance with linguistic regularities in LLM-generated text is not monotonically increasing with training, but instead follows a balanced trajectory with an optimal semantic window. This work establishes a novel methodology for evaluating emergent linguistic structure in neural language models.

### [149] [Training Introspective Behavior: Fine-Tuning Induces Reliable Internal State Detection in a 7B Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21399)
*Joshua Fonseca Rivera*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过微调训练，使7B参数模型从几乎完全失败（0.4%准确率）转变为可靠检测注入的激活模式（85%准确率，0%误报），证明内省能力可以直接训练获得。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Lindsey研究中提出的开放性问题：训练内省能力是否能消除跨模型差异，探索AI透明度的构建路径。

Method: 通过对瞬时单令牌注入进行微调，训练模型检测和识别注入的"思想"激活模式。

Result: 模型从0.4%准确率提升到85%准确率，误报率从6.7%降至0%，能够检测单令牌位置的瞬时"思想"并保留信息。

Conclusion: 至少部分内省行为可以直接诱导，为构建内置AI透明度提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Lindsey (2025) investigates introspective awareness in language models through four experiments, finding that models can sometimes detect and identify injected activation patterns -- but unreliably (~20% success in the best model). We focus on the first of these experiments -- self-report of injected "thoughts" -- and ask whether this capability can be directly trained rather than waiting for emergence. Through fine-tuning on transient single-token injections, we transform a 7B parameter model from near-complete failure (0.4% accuracy, 6.7% false positive rate) to reliable detection (85% accuracy on held-out concepts at α=40, 0% false positives). Our model detects fleeting "thoughts" injected at a single token position, retains that information, and reports the semantic content across subsequent generation steps. On this task, our trained model satisfies three of Lindsey's criteria: accuracy (correct identification), grounding (0/60 false positives), and internality (detection precedes verbalization). Generalization to unseen concept vectors (7.5pp gap) demonstrates the model learns a transferable skill rather than memorizing specific vectors, though this does not establish metacognitive representation in Lindsey's sense. These results address an open question raised by Lindsey: whether "training for introspection would help eliminate cross-model differences." We show that at least one component of introspective behavior can be directly induced, offering a pathway to built-in AI transparency.

*Antonín Jarolím,Martin Fajčík,Lucia Makaiová*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文创建了捷克语和斯洛伐克语细粒度证据提取数据集，评估了LLMs在此任务上的表现，发现LLMs常无法逐字复制证据，且模型大小与性能不成正比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线新闻评论中经常传播错误信息，需要有效方法检测事实错误信息，为此需要识别相关文档并精确定位支持或反驳每个主张的确切文本片段。

Method: 创建了由付费标注人员标注的双向细粒度证据数据集，并在该数据集上评估了多个大型语言模型与人类标注的一致性。

Result: LLMs经常无法从源文本逐字复制证据，导致无效输出。llama3.1:8b模型尽管规模较小但正确输出比例高，而gpt-oss-120b模型参数虽多但表现不佳。qwen3:14b、deepseek-r1:32b和gpt-oss:20b在模型大小与人类标注一致性之间达到有效平衡。

Conclusion: LLMs在细粒度证据提取任务中表现存在局限性，模型大小与性能不成正比，需要开发更有效的方法来改善证据提取的准确性。

Abstract: Misinformation frequently spreads in user comments under online news articles, highlighting the need for effective methods to detect factually incorrect information. To strongly support or refute claims extracted from such comments, it is necessary to identify relevant documents and pinpoint the exact text spans that justify or contradict each claim. This paper focuses on the latter task -- fine-grained evidence extraction for Czech and Slovak claims. We create new dataset, containing two-way annotated fine-grained evidence created by paid annotators. We evaluate large language models (LLMs) on this dataset to assess their alignment with human annotations. The results reveal that LLMs often fail to copy evidence verbatim from the source text, leading to invalid outputs. Error-rate analysis shows that the {llama3.1:8b model achieves a high proportion of correct outputs despite its relatively small size, while the gpt-oss-120b model underperforms despite having many more parameters. Furthermore, the models qwen3:14b, deepseek-r1:32b, and gpt-oss:20b demonstrate an effective balance between model size and alignment with human annotations.

*Zhifeng Hao,Qibin Song,Ruichu Cai,Boyan Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DSR-SQL是一个双状态推理框架，通过上下文状态和生成状态的交互来解决复杂企业数据库中的Text-to-SQL问题，无需后训练或上下文示例即可达到竞争性性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的分治推理方法在处理复杂企业数据库时，由于上下文容量有限、模式链接不可靠和数据库语义基础薄弱，难以保持连贯推理。

Method: 引入双状态推理框架：自适应上下文状态通过精炼大型模式并选择相关结构来构建紧凑的语义忠实环境；渐进生成状态将SQL合成形式化为反馈引导的状态转换，使模型能够自我纠正并与用户意图对齐。

Result: 在Spider 2.0-Snow上达到35.28%的执行准确率，在BIRD开发集上达到68.32%的执行准确率。

Conclusion: DSR-SQL框架有效克服了复杂企业数据库中Text-to-SQL的挑战，实现了竞争性性能，且无需额外训练或示例。

Abstract: Recent divide-and-conquer reasoning approaches, particularly those based on Chain-of-Thought (CoT), have substantially improved the Text-to-SQL capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, when applied to complex enterprise databases, such methods struggle to maintain coherent reasoning due to limited context capacity, unreliable schema linking, and weak grounding in database semantics. To overcome these issues, we introduce DSR-SQL, a \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{S}tate \textbf{R}easoning framework that models Text-to-SQL as an interaction between an adaptive context state and a progressive generation state. The first constructs a compact, semantically faithful environment by refining large schemas and selecting relevant structures, while the second formalizes SQL synthesis as feedback-guided state transitions, enabling the model to self-correct and align with user intent. Without any post-training or in-context examples, DSR-SQL achieves competitive performance, reaching 35.28\% execution accuracy on Spider 2.0-Snow and 68.32\% on BIRD development set. Our implementation will be open-sourced at: https://github.com/DMIRLAB-Group/DSR-SQL.

*Kaifeng Hong,Yinglong Zhang,Xiaoying Hong,Xuewen Xia,Xing Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Odin是一个新的文本属性图模型架构，通过定向双模块机制在特定Transformer层注入图结构，避免了GNN的过平滑问题和Transformer忽略图拓扑的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么依赖GNN（存在过平滑和跳数依赖扩散问题），要么使用Transformer（忽略图拓扑，将节点视为孤立序列），需要一种能有效结合文本理解和结构推理的方法。

Method: 提出Odin架构，在特定Transformer层通过定向双模块机制注入图结构，多跳结构在模型语义层次的不同层级进行集成。还提出了轻量级变体Light Odin，保持相同的层对齐结构抽象。

Result: 在多个文本丰富图基准测试中，Odin实现了最先进的准确率，Light Odin以显著降低的计算成本提供竞争性性能。

Conclusion: Odin和Light Odin形成了一个统一的、无跳数的框架，用于原则性的结构-文本集成，其表达能力严格包含纯Transformer和GNN。

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs require models to effectively combine strong textual understanding with structurally informed reasoning. Existing approaches either rely on GNNs--limited by over-smoothing and hop-dependent diffusion--or employ Transformers that overlook graph topology and treat nodes as isolated sequences. We propose Odin (Oriented Dual-module INtegration), a new architecture that injects graph structure into Transformers at selected depths through an oriented dual-module mechanism.Unlike message-passing GNNs, Odin does not rely on multi-hop diffusion; instead, multi-hop structures are integrated at specific Transformer layers, yielding low-, mid-, and high-level structural abstraction aligned with the model's semantic hierarchy. Because aggregation operates on the global [CLS] representation, Odin fundamentally avoids over-smoothing and decouples structural abstraction from neighborhood size or graph topology. We further establish that Odin's expressive power strictly contains that of both pure Transformers and GNNs.To make the design efficient in large-scale or low-resource settings, we introduce Light Odin, a lightweight variant that preserves the same layer-aligned structural abstraction for faster training and inference. Experiments on multiple text-rich graph benchmarks show that Odin achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, while Light Odin delivers competitive performance with significantly reduced computational cost. Together, Odin and Light Odin form a unified, hop-free framework for principled structure-text integration. The source code of this model has been released at https://github.com/hongkaifeng/Odin.

TL;DR: 对六种最先进的模型合并方法在大型语言模型上进行大规模系统评估，发现最简单的方法Task Arithmetic是唯一能可靠提升性能的方法，其他方法通常导致显著性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模型合并无需额外训练即可将多个微调检查点合并为单一模型，但尚不清楚较小模型和分类器上的优势是否能推广到LLMs。

Method: 对六种最先进的合并方法（包括子空间方法）进行大规模系统评估，涵盖四个开源权重LLMs、每个基础模型十二个微调检查点和十六个标准LLM基准测试。

Result: Task Arithmetic是唯一能可靠提升LLM性能的方法，其他干扰感知和子空间合并方法通常导致显著性能下降。

Conclusion: 当前合并技术不能直接迁移到现代LLMs，需要设计LLM特定的合并算法和合并感知的微调方法。

Abstract: Model merging combines multiple fine-tuned checkpoints into a single model without additional training, offering an attractive approach to reusing models and efficiently improving performance. However, it remains unclear whether the advantages reported for smaller models and classifiers generalize to LLMs. We present a large-scale, systematic evaluation of six state-of-the-art merging methods, including recent subspace methods, across four open-weight LLMs, twelve fine-tuned checkpoints per base model, and sixteen standard LLM benchmarks. Evaluating through standardized benchmarks, we measure both the probability that a merged model outperforms the base model and relative gains over the best individual checkpoint. Our results show that the oldest and simplest method, Task Arithmetic, is the only approach that reliably yields performance gains on LLMs. Other interference-aware and subspace merging methods typically result in significant performance drops. Our findings indicate that current merging techniques do not directly transfer to modern LLMs. This motivates the design of LLM-specific merging algorithms and merging-aware fine-tuning methods. Code will be released upon acceptance of this paper.

TL;DR: 提出了一种双向可读性评估机制，通过捕捉上下文信息识别文本中语义丰富区域，预测句子级可读性，并利用这些标签辅助预测文档整体可读性。同时引入成对排序算法建模可读性级别间的序数关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习在可读性评估中的应用大多未能同时考虑文本长度和可读性标签的序数关系，需要一种更全面的方法来解决这些问题。

Method: 双向可读性评估机制，通过上下文信息识别语义丰富区域预测句子级可读性；成对排序算法通过标签减法建模可读性级别的序数关系。

Result: 在中文和英文数据集上的实验结果表明，该模型取得了有竞争力的性能，并优于其他基线模型。

Conclusion: 提出的双向可读性评估机制和成对排序算法能够有效提升可读性评估的准确性，特别是在处理文本长度和序数关系方面表现出色。

Abstract: Readability assessment aims to evaluate the reading difficulty of a text. In recent years, while deep learning technology has been gradually applied to readability assessment, most approaches fail to consider either the length of the text or the ordinal relationship of readability labels. This paper proposes a bidirectional readability assessment mechanism that captures contextual information to identify regions with rich semantic information in the text, thereby predicting the readability level of individual sentences. These sentence-level labels are then used to assist in predicting the overall readability level of the document. Additionally, a pairwise sorting algorithm is introduced to model the ordinal relationship between readability levels through label subtraction. Experimental results on Chinese and English datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves competitive performance and outperforms other baseline models.

TL;DR: 研究语音翻译模型中性别分配机制，发现模型不简单复制训练数据中的性别关联，而是学习更广泛的男性主导模式，并揭示模型通过第一人称代词将性别化术语与说话者链接，利用频谱分布而非集中音高的性别信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音传达说话者性别信息，在语音翻译中可能导致误性别化问题，但语音翻译模型如何做出性别分配决策的机制尚不清楚。

Method: 研究三个语言对（英-西/法/意）中语音翻译模型为说话者指称术语分配性别的机制，分析训练数据模式、内部语言模型偏见和声学信息的相互作用，使用对比性特征归因分析频谱图。

Result: 模型不简单复制训练数据中的术语特定性别关联，而是学习更广泛的男性主导模式；内部语言模型表现出强烈男性偏见，但模型能基于声学输入覆盖这些偏好；性别准确率更高的模型使用第一人称代词将性别化术语链接回说话者，利用频谱分布而非集中音高的性别信息。

Conclusion: 语音翻译模型通过复杂机制分配性别，涉及训练数据模式、内部语言模型偏见和声学信息的相互作用，揭示了模型使用第一人称代词和分布式频谱信息进行性别分配的新机制。

Abstract: Unlike text, speech conveys information about the speaker, such as gender, through acoustic cues like pitch. This gives rise to modality-specific bias concerns. For example, in speech translation (ST), when translating from languages with notional gender, such as English, into languages where gender-ambiguous terms referring to the speaker are assigned grammatical gender, the speaker's vocal characteristics may play a role in gender assignment. This risks misgendering speakers, whether through masculine defaults or vocal-based assumptions. Yet, how ST models make these decisions remains poorly understood. We investigate the mechanisms ST models use to assign gender to speaker-referring terms across three language pairs (en-es/fr/it), examining how training data patterns, internal language model (ILM) biases, and acoustic information interact. We find that models do not simply replicate term-specific gender associations from training data, but learn broader patterns of masculine prevalence. While the ILM exhibits strong masculine bias, models can override these preferences based on acoustic input. Using contrastive feature attribution on spectrograms, we reveal that the model with higher gender accuracy relies on a previously unknown mechanism: using first-person pronouns to link gendered terms back to the speaker, accessing gender information distributed across the frequency spectrum rather than concentrated in pitch.

TL;DR: RoParQ是一个评估LLMs在转述问题中一致性的基准，通过XParaCon指标和针对性微调策略提升模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在回答转述问题时表现出不一致性，表明其依赖表层模式而非真正的语义理解。

Method: 从标准数据集构建RoParQ基准，生成转述问题；提出XParaCon评估指标；实施基于推理的转述感知SFT策略。

Result: 针对性微调显著提升了模型鲁棒性，轻量级微调模型达到与大型预训练模型相当的一致性水平。

Conclusion: 该方法有效减轻了表层记忆依赖，促进了更鲁棒可靠的LLMs发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit inconsistent behavior when answering paraphrased questions, suggesting a reliance on surface-level patterns rather than true semantic understanding. To address this limitation, we introduce RoParQ, a benchmark specifically constructed to evaluate cross-paraphrase consistency in closed-book multiple-choice QA. This benchmark is derived from standard datasets by generating paraphrases via proprietary models and selectively retaining examples that elicit inconsistent confidence from a judge model. We further propose XParaCon, a novel evaluation metric that quantifies a model's robustness by measuring the standard deviation of accuracies across question variants. Additionally, we implement a reasoning-based, paraphrase-aware Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) strategy designed to align models toward semantic invariance. Our experiments demonstrate that this targeted alignment significantly enhances robustness. Notably, fine-tuned lightweight models achieved consistency levels comparable to much larger pre-trained models. These results highlight the efficacy of our approach in mitigating superficial memorization and fostering more robust, reliable LLMs.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种简单有效的方式来理解大语言模型的内部工作机制，有助于揭示模型决策过程中的潜在捷径和技能编码模式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks, yet their internal mechanisms remain largely opaque. In this paper, we introduce a simple, lightweight, and broadly applicable method with a focus on isolating neurons that encode specific skills. Building upon prior work that identified "skill neurons" via soft prompt training on classification tasks, our approach extends the analysis to complex scenarios involving multiple skills. We correlate neuron activations with auxiliary metrics -- such as external labels and the model's own confidence score -- thereby uncovering interpretable and task-specific behaviors without the need for manual token aggregation. We empirically validate our method on tasks spanning open-ended text generation and natural language inference, demonstrating its ability to detect neurons that not only drive known skills but also reveal previously unidentified shortcuts in arithmetic reasoning on BigBench.

Result: 发现细粒度信息编码的元数据（如文档质量指标）能有效加速预训练，元数据追加和可学习元标记都能提高训练效率。

Conclusion: 提供了整合元数据以改进LLM预训练效率和效果的实用指南，揭示了元数据通过诱导质量感知的潜在结构来加速学习。

Abstract: Incorporating metadata in Large Language Models (LLMs) pretraining has recently emerged as a promising approach to accelerate training. However prior work highlighted only one useful signal-URLs, leaving open the question of whether other forms of metadata could yield greater benefits. In this study, we investigate a wider range of metadata types and find other types of metadata, such as fine-grained indicators of document quality that can also accelerate pretraining when prepended. We identify a common feature among effective metadata: they encode information at a finer granularity. We further introduce metadata appending as a means of improving training efficiency, where predicting an appropriate metadata as auxiliary task can help speed up pretraining. In addition, learnable meta-tokens trained with masked loss can recover part of the speedup by inducing quality-aware latent structure. Using probing, we analyze latent representations to understand how metadata shapes learning. Together, these results yield practical guidelines for integrating metadata to improve both the efficiency and effectiveness of LLM pretraining.

Motivation: 当前AI生成诗歌研究主要集中在英语，本研究探讨在形态复杂、资源较少的斯拉夫语言（捷克语）中，AI诗歌的识别度和美学评价。

Method: 让捷克母语者识别和评价AI与人类创作的诗歌，使用逻辑回归模型分析识别准确率与美学评价的关系。

Result: 参与者识别准确率接近随机水平，AI诗歌美学评分与人类相当或更高，但存在作者偏见影响评价。诗歌熟悉度或文学背景不影响识别准确率。

Conclusion: AI能在捷克语等复杂低资源语言中生成令人信服的诗歌，读者对作者身份的信念与诗歌美学评价密切相关。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly capable of producing creative texts, yet most studies on AI-generated poetry focus on English -- a language that dominates training data. In this paper, we examine the perception of AI- and human-written Czech poetry. We ask if Czech native speakers are able to identify it and how they aesthetically judge it. Participants performed at chance level when guessing authorship (45.8\% correct on average), indicating that Czech AI-generated poems were largely indistinguishable from human-written ones. Aesthetic evaluations revealed a strong authorship bias: when participants believed a poem was AI-generated, they rated it as less favorably, even though AI poems were in fact rated equally or more favorably than human ones on average. The logistic regression model uncovered that the more the people liked a poem, the less probable was that they accurately assign the authorship. Familiarity with poetry or literary background had no effect on recognition accuracy. Our findings show that AI can convincingly produce poetry even in a morphologically complex, low-resource (with respect of the training data of AI models) Slavic language such as Czech. The results suggest that readers' beliefs about authorship and the aesthetic evaluation of the poem are interconnected.

Motivation: 现有的多智能体合成框架依赖中央编排器导致可扩展性瓶颈，或针对特定领域硬编码限制了灵活性，需要一种更高效、灵活的数据生成解决方案。

Method: 采用去中心化的对等设计，将控制和数据流表示为通过分布式队列传递的序列化消息，轻量级智能体独立处理任务，计算密集型操作由分布式服务处理，基于Ray构建。

Result: 在多种合成场景（多智能体协作对话、基于网络的推理数据提取、客户服务环境中的工具使用轨迹生成）中，Matrix在相同硬件资源下实现了2-15倍的数据生成吞吐量提升，且不牺牲输出质量。

Conclusion: Matrix提供了一个模块化、可配置的去中心化框架，能够轻松适应广泛的数据生成工作流，显著提升了多智能体合成数据生成的效率和可扩展性。

Abstract: Synthetic data has become increasingly important for training large language models, especially when real data is scarce, expensive, or privacy-sensitive. Many such generation tasks require coordinated multi-agent workflows, where specialized agents collaborate to produce data that is higher quality, more diverse, and structurally richer. However, existing frameworks for multi-agent synthesis often depend on a centralized orchestrator, creating scalability bottlenecks, or are hardcoded for specific domains, limiting flexibility. We present \textbf{Matrix}, a decentralized framework that represents both control and data flow as serialized messages passed through distributed queues. This peer-to-peer design eliminates the central orchestrator. Each task progresses independently through lightweight agents, while compute-intensive operations, such as LLM inference or containerized environments, are handled by distributed services. Built on Ray, Matrix scales to tens of thousands of concurrent agentic workflows and provides a modular, configurable design that enables easy adaptation to a wide range of data generation workflows. We evaluate Matrix across diverse synthesis scenarios, such as multi-agent collaborative dialogue, web-based reasoning data extraction, and tool-use trajectory generation in customer service environments. In all cases, Matrix achieves $2$--$15\times$ higher data generation throughput under identical hardware resources, without compromising output quality.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在处理深度复杂问题时概念挑战大、计算成本高的问题，通过小型编排器管理其他模型和工具来提升智能上限和效率。

Method: 使用强化学习训练小型编排器，包含结果感知、效率感知和用户偏好感知的奖励机制，协调多种智能工具。

Result: 8B参数的Orchestrator模型在HLE上得分37.1%，超越GPT-5(35.1%)，成本降低2.5倍；在tau2-Bench和FRAMES上大幅超越GPT-5，仅用约30%成本。

Conclusion: 使用轻量级编排模型组合多样化工具比现有方法更高效有效，为实用可扩展的工具增强推理系统铺平道路。

Abstract: Large language models are powerful generalists, yet solving deep and complex problems such as those of the Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) remains both conceptually challenging and computationally expensive. We show that small orchestrators managing other models and a variety of tools can both push the upper bound of intelligence and improve efficiency in solving difficult agentic tasks. We introduce ToolOrchestra, a method for training small orchestrators that coordinate intelligent tools. ToolOrchestra explicitly uses reinforcement learning with outcome-, efficiency-, and user-preference-aware rewards. Using ToolOrchestra, we produce Orchestrator, an 8B model that achieves higher accuracy at lower cost than previous tool-use agents while aligning with user preferences on which tools are to be used for a given query. On HLE, Orchestrator achieves a score of 37.1%, outperforming GPT-5 (35.1%) while being 2.5x more efficient. On tau2-Bench and FRAMES, Orchestrator surpasses GPT-5 by a wide margin while using only about 30% of the cost. Extensive analysis shows that Orchestrator achieves the best trade-off between performance and cost under multiple metrics, and generalizes robustly to unseen tools. These results demonstrate that composing diverse tools with a lightweight orchestration model is both more efficient and more effective than existing methods, paving the way for practical and scalable tool-augmented reasoning systems.

*Yeganeh Kordi,Nihal V. Nayak,Max Zuo,Ilana Nguyen,Stephen H. Bach*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过系统评估LLM在不同难度任务上的泛化能力，发现跨难度泛化有限，训练数据需要包含多种难度级别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对训练数据难度（简单或困难）对LLM性能的影响存在分歧，需要更客观、大规模的分析来理解LLM在不同难度任务上的泛化能力。

Method: 使用数千个不同LLM的输出和项目反应理论(IRT)对六个数据集中的示例进行难度排序，基于LLM能力而非人类主观判断来确定难度评级。

Result: 跨难度泛化通常有限，仅使用简单或困难数据训练无法在所有难度范围内实现一致的性能提升。

Conclusion: LLM的训练和评估数据需要包含多种难度级别，在难度选择上走捷径存在风险。

Abstract: We investigate how well large language models (LLMs) generalize across different task difficulties, a key question for effective data curation and evaluation. Existing research is mixed regarding whether training on easier or harder data leads to better results, and whether those gains come on easier or harder test data. We address this question by conducting a systematic evaluation of LLMs' generalization across models, datasets, and fine-grained groups of example difficulty. We rank examples in six datasets using the outputs of thousands of different LLMs and Item Response Theory (IRT), a well-established difficulty metric in educational testing. Unlike prior work, our difficulty ratings are therefore determined solely by the abilities of many different LLMs, excluding human opinions of difficulty. With a more objective, larger-scale, and finer-grained analysis, we show that cross-difficulty generalization is often limited; training on either easy or hard data cannot achieve consistent improvements across the full range of difficulties. These results show the importance of having a range of difficulties in both training and evaluation data for LLMs, and that taking shortcuts with respect to difficulty is risky.

*Lorenzo De Rebotti,Emanuele Giacomini,Giorgio Grisetti,Luca Di Giammarino*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于方差自适应的多分辨率体素网格方法，通过动态调整体素大小和平面空间哈希表，实现了高效实时的3D表面重建，比固定分辨率方法快13倍且内存使用减少4倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于固定分辨率体素网格或八叉树的体积方法存在内存效率低、计算开销大和缺乏GPU支持的问题，特别是在实时和资源受限场景下。

Method: 使用方差自适应的多分辨率体素网格，根据有符号距离场观测的局部方差动态调整体素大小，采用平面空间哈希表存储所有体素块，支持恒定时间访问和完全GPU并行化。

Result: 开源CUDA/C++实现相比固定分辨率基线实现了13倍加速和4倍内存使用降低，在重建精度方面表现相当。

Conclusion: 该方法为高性能3D重建提供了一个实用且可扩展的解决方案，具有高内存效率和实时可扩展性。

Abstract: Efficient and scalable 3D surface reconstruction from range data remains a core challenge in computer graphics and vision, particularly in real-time and resource-constrained scenarios. Traditional volumetric methods based on fixed-resolution voxel grids or hierarchical structures like octrees often suffer from memory inefficiency, computational overhead, and a lack of GPU support. We propose a novel variance-adaptive, multi-resolution voxel grid that dynamically adjusts voxel size based on the local variance of signed distance field (SDF) observations. Unlike prior multi-resolution approaches that rely on recursive octree structures, our method leverages a flat spatial hash table to store all voxel blocks, supporting constant-time access and full GPU parallelism. This design enables high memory efficiency and real-time scalability. We further demonstrate how our representation supports GPU-accelerated rendering through a parallel quad-tree structure for Gaussian Splatting, enabling effective control over splat density. Our open-source CUDA/C++ implementation achieves up to 13x speedup and 4x lower memory usage compared to fixed-resolution baselines, while maintaining on par results in terms of reconstruction accuracy, offering a practical and extensible solution for high-performance 3D reconstruction.

### [165] [Minimizing Hyperbolic Embedding Distortion with LLM-Guided Hierarchy Restructuring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20679)
*Melika Ayoughi,Pascal Mettes,Paul Groth*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究使用大语言模型自动重构层次结构以优化双曲嵌入质量，实验表明LLM重构的层次结构在多个标准指标上都能产生更高质量的双曲嵌入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双曲嵌入的质量与输入层次结构紧密相关，而现有层次结构往往来自知识图谱或本体，不一定满足高分支因子和单继承等最优嵌入标准。需要帮助知识工程师重新组织层次知识。

Method: 提出基于提示的方法，使用大语言模型根据双曲嵌入的理想标准来转换现有层次结构。在16个不同层次结构上进行实验验证。

Result: 实验结果显示，LLM重构的层次结构在多个标准嵌入质量指标上都能一致地产生更高质量的双曲嵌入。

Conclusion: LLM引导的层次结构重构不仅提高了双曲嵌入质量，还提供了可解释的重组过程，能够为知识工程师提供合理的重组理由。

Abstract: Hyperbolic geometry is an effective geometry for embedding hierarchical data structures. Hyperbolic learning has therefore become increasingly prominent in machine learning applications where data is hierarchically organized or governed by hierarchical semantics, ranging from recommendation systems to computer vision. The quality of hyperbolic embeddings is tightly coupled to the structure of the input hierarchy, which is often derived from knowledge graphs or ontologies. Recent work has uncovered that for an optimal hyperbolic embedding, a high branching factor and single inheritance are key, while embedding algorithms are robust to imbalance and hierarchy size. To assist knowledge engineers in reorganizing hierarchical knowledge, this paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) have the ability to automatically restructure hierarchies to meet these criteria. We propose a prompt-based approach to transform existing hierarchies using LLMs, guided by known desiderata for hyperbolic embeddings. Experiments on 16 diverse hierarchies show that LLM-restructured hierarchies consistently yield higher-quality hyperbolic embeddings across several standard embedding quality metrics. Moreover, we show how LLM-guided hierarchy restructuring enables explainable reorganizations, providing justifications to knowledge engineers.

Motivation: 当前的安全数据集主要是英语中心的，无法捕捉非英语社会文化背景（如韩语）中的特定风险，且通常仅限于文本模态。

Method: 首先定义了35种AI风险因素的分类法，然后构建了包含11,480个实例的韩语多模态数据集，采用两阶段构建（专家引导播种和众包扩展）、三重独立标注和迭代专家红队循环的质量控制流程。

Result: 试点研究验证了AssurAI在评估最新LLM安全性方面的有效性。

Conclusion: AssurAI的发布将促进为韩语社区开发更安全可靠的生成式AI系统。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of generative AI necessitates robust safety evaluations. However, current safety datasets are predominantly English-centric, failing to capture specific risks in non-English, socio-cultural contexts such as Korean, and are often limited to the text modality. To address this gap, we introduce AssurAI, a new quality-controlled Korean multimodal dataset for evaluating the safety of generative AI. First, we define a taxonomy of 35 distinct AI risk factors, adapted from established frameworks by a multidisciplinary expert group to cover both universal harms and relevance to the Korean socio-cultural context. Second, leveraging this taxonomy, we construct and release AssurAI, a large-scale Korean multimodal dataset comprising 11,480 instances across text, image, video, and audio. Third, we apply the rigorous quality control process used to ensure data integrity, featuring a two-phase construction (i.e., expert-led seeding and crowdsourced scaling), triple independent annotation, and an iterative expert red-teaming loop. Our pilot study validates AssurAI's effectiveness in assessing the safety of recent LLMs. We release AssurAI to the public to facilitate the development of safer and more reliable generative AI systems for the Korean community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法严重依赖手动预定义的操作符，限制了泛化性和可扩展性，需要开发完全自动化的智能体工作流生成方法。

Method: 采用三阶段操作符提取过程：基于案例的初始操作符生成、操作符聚类和初步抽象、深度提取抽象执行操作符，并引入操作符记忆机制增强工作流搜索。

Result: 在通用和具身基准测试中，A²Flow相比最先进基线平均性能提升2.4%和19.3%，资源使用减少37%。

Conclusion: A²Flow通过完全自动化的操作符提取和工作流构建，显著提升了智能体工作流的性能和效率，为自动化工作流生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong potential in automating the design of agentic workflows. However, existing methods still rely heavily on manually predefined operators, limiting generalization and scalability. To address this issue, we propose $A^2Flow$, a fully automated framework for agentic workflow generation based on self-adaptive abstraction operators. $A^2Flow$ employs a three-stage operator extraction process: 1) Case-based Initial Operator Generation: leveraging expert demonstrations and LLM reasoning to generate case-specific operators; 2) Operator Clustering and Preliminary Abstraction: grouping similar operators across tasks to form preliminary abstractions; and 3) Deep Extraction for Abstract Execution Operators: applying long chain-of-thought prompting and multi-path reasoning to derive compact and generalizable execution operators. These operators serve as reusable building blocks for workflow construction without manual predefinition. Furthermore, we enhance node-level workflow search with an operator memory mechanism, which retains historical outputs to enrich context and improve decision-making. Experiments on general and embodied benchmarks show that $A^2Flow$ achieves a 2.4\% and 19.3\% average performance improvement and reduces resource usage by 37\% over state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: 多智能体工作流分解方法在复杂科学推理任务中具有优势，特别是在需要演绎推理的场景下。

Abstract: Scientific reasoning through Large Language Models in heliophysics involves more than just recalling facts: it requires incorporating physical assumptions, maintaining consistent units, and providing clear scientific formats through coordinated approaches. To address these challenges, we present Reasoning With a Star, a newly contributed heliophysics dataset applicable to reasoning; we also provide an initial benchmarking approach. Our data are constructed from National Aeronautics and Space Administration & University Corporation for Atmospheric Research Living With a Star summer school problem sets and compiled into a readily consumable question-and-answer structure with question contexts, reasoning steps, expected answer type, ground-truth targets, format hints, and metadata. A programmatic grader checks the predictions using unit-aware numerical tolerance, symbolic equivalence, and schema validation. We benchmark a single-shot baseline and four multi-agent patterns, finding that decomposing workflows through systems engineering principles outperforms direct prompting on problems requiring deductive reasoning rather than pure inductive recall.

Abstract: Emerging from NASA's spacecraft simulations in the 1960s, digital twin technology has advanced through industrial adoption to spark a healthcare transformation. A digital twin is a dynamic, data-driven virtual counterpart of a physical system, continuously updated through real-time data streams and capable of bidirectional interaction. In medicine, digital twin integrates imaging, biosensors, and computational models to generate patient-specific simulations that support diagnosis, treatment planning, and drug development. Representative applications include cardiac digital twin for predicting arrhythmia treatment outcomes, oncology digital twin for tracking tumor progression and optimizing radiotherapy, and pharmacological digital twin for accelerating drug discovery. Despite rapid progress, major challenges, including interoperability, data privacy, and model fidelity, continue to limit widespread clinical integration. Emerging solutions such as explainable AI, federated learning, and harmonized regulatory frameworks offer promising pathways forward. Looking ahead, advances in multi-organ digital twin, genomics integration, and ethical governance will be essential to ensure that digital twin shifts healthcare from reactive treatment to predictive, preventive, and truly personalized medicine.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多模态思维链方法在科学问答之外的多样化领域（如常识推理）的泛化能力，当前研究主要局限于科学问答基准。

Method: 采用Zhang等人提出的两阶段框架，将理由生成与答案推理分离，通过门控融合机制整合视觉特征与基于T5的语言模型，并进行系统的消融研究。

Result: 视觉特征整合显著减少了理由生成中的幻觉，但思维链推理效果在不同问题类型间差异很大，常识推理尤其具有挑战性。

Conclusion: 为研究者实施多模态推理系统提供了实用见解，并确定了跨领域泛化中需要改进的关键领域。

Abstract: While recent work has extended CoT to multimodal settings, achieving state-of-the-art results on science question answering benchmarks like ScienceQA, the generalizability of these approaches across diverse domains remains underexplored. This work presents a comprehensive analysis of Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (Multimodal-CoT) reasoning, evaluating its effectiveness on the A-OKVQA, OKVQA and ChartQA datasets, which requires broad commonsense and world knowledge beyond scientific reasoning. We implement the two-stage framework proposed by Zhang et al. [3], which separates rationale generation from answer inference and integrates vision features through a gated fusion mechanism with T5-based language models. Through systematic ablation studies, we analyze the contributions of vision features, rationale quality, and architectural choices. Our findings reveal that while vision integration significantly reduces hallucination in rationale generation, the effectiveness of CoT reasoning varies substantially across question types, with commonsense reasoning presenting particular challenges. This work provides practical insights for researchers implementing multimodal reasoning systems and identifies key areas for future improvement in cross-domain generalization.

Motivation: 现有多接入点协调协议依赖静态规则，无法适应动态网络条件（如变化的干扰水平和拓扑结构），限制了在密集Wi-Fi环境中的性能表现。

Method: 将每个接入点建模为自主的大型语言模型代理，通过包含记忆、反思和工具使用的认知工作流程，进行自然语言对话来协作推理网络状态并协商自适应协调策略。

Result: 综合仿真结果表明，该代理框架成功适应了多样化和动态的网络环境，显著优于最先进的空间复用基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架验证了作为未来无线网络稳健智能解决方案的潜力，展示了AI代理在动态网络协调中的有效性。

Abstract: Multi-access point coordination (MAPC) is a key technology for enhancing throughput in next-generation Wi-Fi within dense overlapping basic service sets. However, existing MAPC protocols rely on static, protocol-defined rules, which limits their ability to adapt to dynamic network conditions such as varying interference levels and topologies. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Agentic AI Wi-Fi framework where each access point, modeled as an autonomous large language model agent, collaboratively reasons about the network state and negotiates adaptive coordination strategies in real time. This dynamic collaboration is achieved through a cognitive workflow that enables the agents to engage in natural language dialogue, leveraging integrated memory, reflection, and tool use to ground their decisions in past experience and environmental feedback. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that our agentic framework successfully learns to adapt to diverse and dynamic network environments, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art spatial reuse baseline and validating its potential as a robust and intelligent solution for future wireless networks.

TL;DR: OpenApps是一个轻量级开源生态系统，包含6个可配置应用，用于评估多模态UI代理在不同应用变体中的可靠性。研究发现代理在固定应用中的可靠性相对稳定，但在不同应用变体间成功率波动可达50%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估方法依赖固定环境，无法衡量代理在不同应用设计和内容变体中的可靠性，而实际部署时会遇到各种应用变体影响任务完成能力。

Method: 开发OpenApps生态系统，包含6个可配置应用（消息、日历、地图等），只需单个CPU即可运行，能够生成和部署数千个应用版本。进行了超过10,000次独立评估，研究7个领先多模态代理的可靠性。

Result: 代理在固定应用中的可靠性相对稳定，但在应用变体间可靠性差异显著。许多代理的任务成功率在不同应用版本间波动超过50%，如Kimi-VL-3B的平均成功率从63%降至4%。代理行为（如循环或幻觉操作）也随环境配置大幅变化。

Conclusion: 测量代理在应用变体维度上的可靠性至关重要，OpenApps为此提供了有效工具，突显了当前评估方法的局限性。

Abstract: Reliability is key to realizing the promise of autonomous UI-Agents, multimodal agents that directly interact with apps in the same manner as humans, as users must be able to trust an agent to complete a given task. Current evaluations rely on fixed environments, often clones of existing apps, which are limited in that they can only shed light on whether or how often an agent can complete a task within a specific environment. When deployed however, agents are likely to encounter variations in app design and content that can affect an agent's ability to complete a task. To address this blind spot of measuring agent reliability across app variations, we develop OpenApps, a light-weight open-source ecosystem with six apps (messenger, calendar, maps, etc.) that are configurable in appearance and content. OpenApps requires just a single CPU to run, enabling easy generation and deployment of thousands of versions of each app. Specifically, we run more than 10,000 independent evaluations to study reliability across seven leading multimodal agents. We find that while standard reliability within a fixed app is relatively stable, reliability can vary drastically when measured across app variations. Task success rates for many agents can fluctuate by more than $50\%$ across app variations. For example, Kimi-VL-3B's average success across all tasks fluctuates from $63\%$ to just $4\%$ across app versions. We also find agent behaviors such as looping or hallucinating actions can differ drastically depending on the environment configuration. These initial findings highlight the importance of measuring reliability along this new dimension of app variations. OpenApps is available at https://facebookresearch.github.io/OpenApps/

TL;DR: RILKE是一种在表示空间进行干预的终身知识控制方法，通过低维子空间更新和查询自适应路由，实现复杂非结构化知识的细粒度控制，同时保持基础模型权重冻结。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型经常产生错误或过时的内容，如何在终身学习环境中高效准确地更新知识而不需要昂贵的重新训练是一个重大挑战。

Method: RILKE在模型的表示空间进行干预，学习抗释义和编辑局部化的模块，将每个更新限制在低维子空间以减少交叉编辑干扰，推理时通过查询自适应路由选择适当的模块。

Result: 在LLaMA和Qwen模型的知识编辑基准测试中，RILKE能够扩展到大规模数据集，展现出高编辑成功率、强释义泛化能力，并以适度的内存开销保持通用效用。

Conclusion: RILKE是LLM中终身知识控制的有效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often produce incorrect or outdated content. Updating their knowledge efficiently and accurately without costly retraining is a major challenge. This problem is especially hard for complex, unstructured knowledge in a lifelong setting, where many edits must coexist without interference. We introduce RILKE (Representation Intervention for Lifelong KnowledgE Control), a robust and scalable method that treats knowledge control as interventions within the model's representation space. Leveraging representation-space expressiveness, we identify two properties enabling RILKE to deliver fine-grained control over complex, unstructured knowledge while maintaining general utility with frozen base weights. During training, RILKE learns paraphrase-robust and edit-localized modules that limit each update to a low-dimensional subspace to minimize cross-edit interference. In inference, a query-adaptive router selects the appropriate module to guide the model's generation. In evaluation on knowledge editing benchmarks with LLaMA and Qwen models, RILKE is scalable to large-scale datasets, demonstrating high edit success, strong paraphrase generalization, and preserving general utility with modest memory overhead. These results show RILKE is an effective and scalable solution for lifelong knowledge control in LLMs.

Conclusion: 该框架首次实现了保证最优的组合解释计算，揭示了现有方法的次优性问题，并提供了更灵活高效的替代方案。

Abstract: While neurons are the basic units of deep neural networks, it is still unclear what they learn and if their knowledge is aligned with that of humans. Compositional explanations aim to answer this question by describing the spatial alignment between neuron activations and concepts through logical rules. These logical descriptions are typically computed via a search over all possible concept combinations. Since computing the spatial alignment over the entire state space is computationally infeasible, the literature commonly adopts beam search to restrict the space. However, beam search cannot provide any theoretical guarantees of optimality, and it remains unclear how close current explanations are to the true optimum. In this theoretical paper, we address this gap by introducing the first framework for computing guaranteed optimal compositional explanations. Specifically, we propose: (i) a decomposition that identifies the factors influencing the spatial alignment, (ii) a heuristic to estimate the alignment at any stage of the search, and (iii) the first algorithm that can compute optimal compositional explanations within a feasible time. Using this framework, we analyze the differences between optimal and non-optimal explanations in the most popular settings for compositional explanations, the computer vision domain and Convolutional Neural Networks. In these settings, we demonstrate that 10-40 percent of explanations obtained with beam search are suboptimal when overlapping concepts are involved. Finally, we evaluate a beam-search variant guided by our proposed decomposition and heuristic, showing that it matches or improves runtime over prior methods while offering greater flexibility in hyperparameters and computational resources.

Motivation: 探索现代视觉语言模型是否表现出具身认知的迹象，即智能是否源于传感器运动交互而非被动观察。

Method: 将具身认知评估构建为部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程中的世界建模问题，使用从机器人仿真合成的问答对，包含正向世界建模（根据动作重排观察序列）和逆向世界建模（根据观察重排动作序列）两个任务。

Result: 前沿视觉语言模型与人类之间存在性能差距，且随着交互时间跨度增加而扩大；模型在逆向任务上表现更好，并表现出人类中心偏见。

Conclusion: 现代视觉语言模型在具身认知能力方面仍存在局限，需要进一步发展才能达到人类水平的具身智能。

Abstract: Embodied cognition argues that intelligence arises from sensorimotor interaction rather than passive observation. It raises an intriguing question: do modern vision-language models (VLMs), trained largely in a disembodied manner, exhibit signs of embodied cognition? We introduce ENACT, a benchmark that casts evaluation of embodied cognition as world modeling from egocentric interaction in a visual question answering (VQA) format. Framed as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) whose actions are scene graph changes, ENACT comprises two complementary sequence reordering tasks: forward world modeling (reorder shuffled observations given actions) and inverse world modeling (reorder shuffled actions given observations). While conceptually simple, solving these tasks implicitly demands capabilities central to embodied cognition-affordance recognition, action-effect reasoning, embodied awareness, and interactive, long-horizon memory from partially observable egocentric input, while avoiding low-level image synthesis that could confound the evaluation. We provide a scalable pipeline that synthesizes QA pairs from robotics simulation (BEHAVIOR) and evaluates models on 8,972 QA pairs spanning long-horizon home-scale activities. Experiments reveal a performance gap between frontier VLMs and humans that widens with interaction horizon. Models consistently perform better on the inverse task than the forward one and exhibit anthropocentric biases, including a preference for right-handed actions and degradation when camera intrinsics or viewpoints deviate from human vision.

*Rahul Dass,Thomas Bowlin,Zebing Li,Xiao Jin,Ashok Goel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Ivy是一个AI辅导系统，通过将符号化的任务-方法-知识(TMK)模型与生成式解释层结合，提供结构化、多步骤的解释，以改进程序技能学习中的解释质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在程序技能学习中，教学解释不仅要传达步骤，还要传达背后的因果、目标导向和组合逻辑。大型语言模型(LLMs)通常产生流畅但浅层的回答，缺乏这种结构。

Method: 结合符号化的TMK模型与生成式解释层，TMK编码因果转换、目标层次和问题分解，在明确的结构边界内指导LLM构建解释。

Result: 与GPT和检索增强GPT基线相比，Ivy在三个推理维度上通过专家和独立注释评估，显示符号约束持续提高了"如何"和"为什么"问题解释的结构质量。

Conclusion: 这项研究展示了一种可扩展的AI教育方法，通过符号约束增强了AI生成解释在教学辅导系统中的教育价值。

Abstract: In procedural skill learning, instructional explanations must convey not just steps, but the causal, goal-directed, and compositional logic behind them. Large language models (LLMs) often produce fluent yet shallow responses that miss this structure. We present Ivy, an AI coaching system that delivers structured, multi-step explanations by combining symbolic Task-Method-Knowledge (TMK) models with a generative interpretation layer-an LLM that constructs explanations while being constrained by TMK structure. TMK encodes causal transitions, goal hierarchies, and problem decompositions, and guides the LLM within explicit structural bounds. We evaluate Ivy against responses against GPT and retrieval-augmented GPT baselines using expert and independent annotations across three inferential dimensions. Results show that symbolic constraints consistently improve the structural quality of explanations for "how" and "why" questions. This study demonstrates a scalable AI for education approach that strengthens the pedagogical value of AI-generated explanations in intelligent coaching systems.

*Jinpeng Wang,Chao Li,Ting Ye,Mengyuan Zhang,Wei Liu,Jian Luan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出ICPO方法，通过利用LLM生成不同响应的概率来反映其推理过程的自我评估，结合偏好优势分数和可验证奖励来提升推理能力，解决现有RLVR方法中的粗粒度奖励、奖励噪声和低效探索问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法存在粗粒度奖励、奖励噪声和低效探索等问题，导致训练不稳定和熵崩溃，需要改进以提升LLM的推理能力。

Method: ICPO方法通过计算多个响应在相同输入提示下的相对生成概率来获得偏好优势分数，并将该分数与可验证奖励结合指导探索过程。

Result: 在四个通用领域基准和三个数学基准上的综合实验表明，ICPO相比GRPO能稳定提升推理能力。

Conclusion: ICPO能有效缓解粗粒度奖励和奖励噪声问题，抑制过度自信错误，增强被低估高质量响应的相对优势，防止模型过拟合特定策略，促进更彻底的探索。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) demonstrates significant potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing RLVR methods are often constrained by issues such as coarse-grained rewards, reward noise, and inefficient exploration, which lead to unstable training and entropy collapse. To address this challenge, we propose the Intrinsic Confidence-Driven Group Relative Preference Optimization method (ICPO). The intuition behind it lies in the fact that the probabilities of an LLM generating different responses can inherently and directly reflect its self-assessment of the reasoning process. Inspired by the idea of preference modeling, ICPO calculates a preference advantage score for each response by comparing the relative generation probabilities of multiple responses under the same input prompt, and integrates this score with verifiable rewards to guide the exploration process. We have discovered that the preference advantage score not only alleviates the issues of coarse-grained rewards and reward noise but also effectively curbs overconfident errors, enhances the relative superiority of undervalued high-quality responses, and prevents the model from overfitting to specific strategies, thereby facilitating more thorough exploration. Comprehensive experiments across four general-domain benchmarks and three mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that ICPO steadily boosts reasoning compared to GRPO.

*Linze Chen,Yufan Cai,Zhe Hou,Jinsong Dong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: L4M是一个结合对抗性LLM代理和SMT求解器验证的法律推理框架，将自然语言的解释灵活性与符号验证的严谨性相结合，在公共基准测试中超越了先进LLM和法律AI基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的系统擅长表面文本分析，但缺乏原则性法理学所需的保证。法律理性表现为实质理性（结果公平性）和形式理性（遵循明确规则），需要将自然语言的灵活性与符号验证的严谨性统一起来。

Method: 三阶段流程：1) 法规形式化：将法律条款转换为逻辑公式；2) 双重事实和法规提取：检察官和辩护方对齐的LLM独立提取事实元组和法规；3) 求解器中心裁决：自动形式化器将双方论证编译为逻辑约束，通过不满足核心触发迭代自我批评，最终由法官LLM将可满足公式转化为透明判决。

Result: 在公共基准测试中，该系统超越了GPT-4-mini、DeepSeek-V3、Claude 4等先进LLM以及最先进的法律AI基线，同时提供严格且可解释的符号论证。

Conclusion: L4M框架成功地将对抗性LLM代理与SMT求解器验证相结合，为法律决策提供了兼具解释灵活性和形式严谨性的解决方案，实现了超越现有方法的性能，同时保证了推理过程的透明性和可解释性。

Abstract: The rationality of law manifests in two forms: substantive rationality, which concerns the fairness or moral desirability of outcomes, and formal rationality, which requires legal decisions to follow explicitly stated, general, and logically coherent rules. Existing LLM-based systems excel at surface-level text analysis but lack the guarantees required for principled jurisprudence. We introduce L4M, a novel framework that combines adversarial LLM agents with SMT-solver-backed proofs to unite the interpretive flexibility of natural language with the rigor of symbolic verification. The pipeline consists of three phases: (1) Statute Formalization, where domain-specific prompts convert legal provisions into logical formulae; (2) Dual Fact and Statute Extraction, in which prosecutor- and defense-aligned LLMs independently map case narratives to fact tuples and statutes, ensuring role isolation; and (3) Solver-Centric Adjudication, where an autoformalizer compiles both parties' arguments into logic constraints, and unsat cores trigger iterative self-critique until a satisfiable formula is achieved, which is then verbalized by a Judge-LLM into a transparent verdict and optimized sentence. Experimental results on public benchmarks show that our system surpasses advanced LLMs including GPT-o4-mini, DeepSeek-V3, and Claude 4 as well as state-of-the-art Legal AI baselines, while providing rigorous and explainable symbolic justifications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OVOD-Agent将开放词汇目标检测从被动类别匹配转变为主动视觉推理和自我进化的检测过程，通过视觉思维链和弱马尔可夫决策过程建模，在有限监督下实现更好的检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开放词汇目标检测方法虽然使用多模态预训练，但推理仍局限于固定类别名称，导致训练和推理之间存在差距。文本空间仍有待充分探索，改进文本表示能显著提升检测性能。

Method: 提出OVOD-Agent框架，将文本优化过程扩展为可解释的视觉思维链。将视觉上下文转换建模为八个状态空间上的弱马尔可夫决策过程，使用Bandit模块生成探索信号，并集成马尔可夫转移矩阵与Bandit轨迹进行自监督奖励模型优化。

Result: 在COCO和LVIS数据集上的实验表明，OVOD-Agent在不同骨干网络上均提供了一致的性能提升，特别是在稀有类别上表现突出。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架通过主动视觉推理和自我进化检测机制，有效提升了开放词汇目标检测的性能，特别是在处理稀有类别时表现出色。

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD) aims to enable detectors to generalize across categories by leveraging semantic information. Although existing methods are pretrained on large vision-language datasets, their inference is still limited to fixed category names, creating a gap between multimodal training and unimodal inference. Previous work has shown that improving textual representation can significantly enhance OVOD performance, indicating that the textual space is still underexplored. To this end, we propose OVOD-Agent, which transforms passive category matching into proactive visual reasoning and self-evolving detection. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigm, OVOD-Agent extends the textual optimization process into an interpretable Visual-CoT with explicit actions. OVOD's lightweight nature makes LLM-based management unsuitable; instead, we model visual context transitions as a Weakly Markovian Decision Process (w-MDP) over eight state spaces, which naturally represents the agent's state, memory, and interaction dynamics. A Bandit module generates exploration signals under limited supervision, helping the agent focus on uncertain regions and adapt its detection policy. We further integrate Markov transition matrices with Bandit trajectories for self-supervised Reward Model (RM) optimization, forming a closed loop from Bandit exploration to RM learning. Experiments on COCO and LVIS show that OVOD-Agent provides consistent improvements across OVOD backbones, particularly on rare categories, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

TL;DR: 本文对Halpern和Pearl的因果定义进行抽象化，提取关键特征，使其能应用于任何定义了反事实的模型，从而扩展了因果分析的应用范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Halpern和Pearl的因果定义局限于因果模型，无法处理包含析取、否定、信念和嵌套反事实的复杂公式，需要更通用的定义框架。

Method: 通过抽象化Halpern-Pearl因果定义的关键特征，构建一个可在任何反事实定义模型中应用的通用因果定义框架。

Result: 新定义不仅能应用于更广泛的模型（包括允许回溯的模型），还能处理复杂逻辑公式的因果分析，并能扩展到解释的定义。

Conclusion: 抽象化方法扩展了因果定义的应用范围，提供了对因果定义特征的更深理解，并为跨模型的解释定义奠定了基础。

Abstract: Perhaps the most prominent current definition of (actual) causality is due to Halpern and Pearl.  It is defined using causal models (also known as structural equations models).  We abstract the definition, extracting its key features, so that it can be applied to any other model where counterfactuals are defined. By abstracting the definition, we gain a number of benefits. Not only can we apply the definition in a wider range of models, including ones that allow, for example, backtracking, but we can apply the definition to determine if A is a cause of B  even if A and B are formulas involving disjunctions, negations, beliefs, and nested counterfactuals (none of which can be handled by the Halpern-Pearl definition). Moreover, we can extend the ideas to getting an abstract definition of explanation that can be applied beyond causal models. Finally, we gain a deeper understanding of features of the definition  even in causal models.

*Jiayuan Zhang,Kaiquan Chen,Zhihao Lu,Enshen Zhou,Qian Yu,Jing Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Prune4Web是一个新颖的网页自动化范式，通过将DOM处理从资源密集的LLM读取转向高效的程序化剪枝，解决了复杂网页DOM结构过大的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM网页代理在处理复杂真实网页时面临DOM结构过大（1万到10万token）的挑战，现有策略要么依赖粗糙的DOM截断（可能丢失关键信息），要么使用低效的启发式方法和单独排名模型，无法在精度和可扩展性之间达到最佳平衡。

Method: 提出DOM树剪枝编程方法，让LLM生成可执行的Python评分脚本来基于分解子任务的语义线索动态过滤DOM元素。该方法无需LLM读取原始庞大DOM，而是将遍历和评分委托给轻量级、可解释的程序。

Result: 实现了25倍到50倍的候选元素减少，便于精确的动作定位并减轻注意力稀释。在低级别接地任务上，准确率从46.8%显著提升到88.28%。

Conclusion: Prune4Web通过程序化剪枝方法有效解决了网页自动化中的DOM处理瓶颈，在真实世界网页自动化中表现出卓越效能。

Abstract: Web automation employs intelligent agents to execute high-level tasks by mimicking human interactions with web interfaces. Despite the capabilities of recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents, navigating complex, real-world webpages efficiently remains a significant hurdle due to the prohibitively large size of Document Object Model (DOM) structures, often ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 tokens. Existing strategies typically rely on crude DOM truncation -- risking the loss of critical information -- or employ inefficient heuristics and separate ranking models, failing to achieve an optimal balance between precision and scalability. To address these challenges, we introduce Prune4Web, a novel paradigm that shifts DOM processing from resource-intensive LLM reading to efficient programmatic pruning. Central to our approach is DOM Tree Pruning Programming, where an LLM generates executable Python scoring scripts to dynamically filter DOM elements based on semantic cues from decomposed sub-tasks. This mechanism eliminates the need for LLMs to ingest raw, massive DOMs, instead delegating traversal and scoring to lightweight, interpretable programs. This methodology achieves a 25x to 50x reduction in candidate elements for grounding, thereby facilitating precise action localization while mitigating attention dilution. Furthermore, we propose a specialized data annotation pipeline and a two-turn dialogue training strategy that jointly optimizes the Planner, Programmatic Filter, and Grounder within a unified framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Notably, on our low-level grounding task, Prune4Web dramatically improves accuracy from 46.8% to 88.28%, underscoring its efficacy in real-world web automation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统药物重定位预测需要多领域专家协作，但现有工具碎片化且数据异构，工作流集成困难。需要开发能让临床专家直接使用的系统。

Method: 基于NeDRex知识图谱构建多智能体系统，包括查询路由、数据检索、算法执行、结果可视化等专门智能体，配备推理模块检测幻觉。

Result: 系统实现了自然语言访问生物医学KG，集成网络分析、药物重定位、功能一致性评估、文献挖掘等智能体，支持复杂分析流程。

Conclusion: ChatDRex民主化了生物信息学访问，使临床专家能生成假设并探索药物重定位机会，加速新疗法发现和转化研究。

Abstract: Repurposing approved drugs offers a time-efficient and cost-effective alternative to traditional drug development. However, in silico prediction of repurposing candidates is challenging and requires the effective collaboration of specialists in various fields, including pharmacology, medicine, biology, and bioinformatics. Fragmented, specialized algorithms and tools often address only narrow aspects of the overall problem, and heterogeneous, unstructured data landscapes require specialized users to be involved. Hence, these data services do not integrate smoothly across workflows. With ChatDRex, we present a conversation-based, multi-agent system that facilitates the execution of complex bioinformatic analyses aiming for network-based drug repurposing prediction. It builds on the integrated systems medicine knowledge graph NeDRex. ChatDRex provides natural language access to its extensive biomedical KG and integrates bioinformatics agents for network analysis and drug repurposing, complemented by agents for functional coherence evaluation for in silico validation, as well as agents for literature mining and for discussing the obtained results in a scientific context. Its flexible multi-agent design assigns specific tasks to specialized agents, including query routing, data retrieval, algorithm execution, and result visualization. A dedicated reasoning module keeps the user in the loop and allows for hallucination detection. By enabling physicians and researchers without computer science expertise to control complex analyses in natural language, ChatDRex democratizes access to bioinformatics as an important resource for drug repurposing. It enables clinical experts to generate hypotheses and explore drug repurposing opportunities, ultimately accelerating the discovery of novel therapies and advancing personalized medicine and translational research.

Abstract: Extreme weather events pose escalating risks to global society, underscoring the urgent need to unravel their underlying physical mechanisms. Yet the prevailing expert-driven, labor-intensive diagnostic paradigm has created a critical analytical bottleneck, stalling scientific progress. While AI for Earth Science has achieved notable advances in prediction, the equally essential challenge of automated diagnostic reasoning remains largely unexplored. We present the Extreme Weather Expert (EWE), the first intelligent agent framework dedicated to this task. EWE emulates expert workflows through knowledge-guided planning, closed-loop reasoning, and a domain-tailored meteorological toolkit. It autonomously produces and interprets multimodal visualizations from raw meteorological data, enabling comprehensive diagnostic analyses. To catalyze progress, we introduce the first benchmark for this emerging field, comprising a curated dataset of 103 high-impact events and a novel step-wise evaluation metric. EWE marks a step toward automated scientific discovery and offers the potential to democratize expertise and intellectual resources, particularly for developing nations vulnerable to extreme weather.

Motivation: 现有方法存在计算成本高或过度拒绝安全指令的问题，需要解决在家庭环境中确保具身AI代理任务规划安全性的挑战。

Method: 使用多LLM代理对指令安全性进行辩论，由关键评估器基于逻辑性、风险识别、证据质量和清晰度评分，通过迭代审议和共识投票达成决策。

Result: 在AI2-THOR和VirtualHome上的实验显示，该方法对不安全任务的拒绝率超过90%，同时保持低安全任务拒绝率，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该工作为构建可信赖的具身代理提供了可扩展、模型无关的解决方案。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of embodied AI agents during task planning is critical for real-world deployment, especially in household environments where dangerous instructions pose significant risks. Existing methods often suffer from either high computational costs due to preference alignment training or over-rejection when using single-agent safety prompts. To address these limitations, we propose MADRA, a training-free Multi-Agent Debate Risk Assessment framework that leverages collective reasoning to enhance safety awareness without sacrificing task performance. MADRA employs multiple LLM-based agents to debate the safety of a given instruction, guided by a critical evaluator that scores responses based on logical soundness, risk identification, evidence quality, and clarity. Through iterative deliberation and consensus voting, MADRA significantly reduces false rejections while maintaining high sensitivity to dangerous tasks. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical cognitive collaborative planning framework that integrates safety, memory, planning, and self-evolution mechanisms to improve task success rates through continuous learning. We also contribute SafeAware-VH, a benchmark dataset for safety-aware task planning in VirtualHome, containing 800 annotated instructions. Extensive experiments on AI2-THOR and VirtualHome demonstrate that our approach achieves over 90% rejection of unsafe tasks while ensuring that safe-task rejection is low, outperforming existing methods in both safety and execution efficiency. Our work provides a scalable, model-agnostic solution for building trustworthy embodied agents.

Motivation: 现有基准过度简化空间认知，将其简化为单一维度指标，无法捕捉空间能力的层次结构和相互依赖关系，需要更系统的评估框架。

Method: 构建分层空间认知框架（五个认知层次），开发SpatialBench大规模细粒度基准（15个任务），引入高层能力导向的统一评估指标。

Result: 实验显示MLLMs在不同认知层次上表现分层：感知基础强，但在符号推理、因果推断和规划方面受限；人类进行选择性目标导向抽象，而MLLMs倾向于过度关注表面细节。

Conclusion: 建立了首个系统测量MLLMs分层空间认知的框架，为未来空间智能系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Spatial cognition is fundamental to real-world multimodal intelligence, allowing models to effectively interact with the physical environment. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant strides, existing benchmarks often oversimplify spatial cognition, reducing it to a single-dimensional metric, which fails to capture the hierarchical structure and interdependence of spatial abilities. To address this gap, we propose a hierarchical spatial cognition framework that decomposes spatial intelligence into five progressively complex levels from basic observation to high-level planning. Building upon this taxonomy, we construct SpatialBench, a large-scale, fine-grained benchmark covering 15 tasks aligned with these cognitive levels. To provide a unified evaluation across heterogeneous tasks, we further introduce a high-level capability-oriented metric that reliably assesses a model's overall spatial reasoning ability. Extensive experiments over massive MLLMs reveal distinct performance stratification across cognitive levels: models exhibit strong perceptual grounding yet remain limited in symbolic reasoning, causal inference, and planning. Additional human tests demonstrate that humans perform selective, goal-directed abstraction, while MLLMs tend to over-attend to surface details without coherent spatial intent. Our work establishes the first systematic framework for measuring hierarchical spatial cognition in MLLMs, laying the foundation for future spatially intelligent systems.

Result: 显著提升多个数学验证基准性能，token效率超过扩展长链思维，且发现数据集中存在标注错误导致性能被低估

Conclusion: 悲观验证能有效提升语言模型数学输出的可靠性，对实现长视野数学任务至关重要

Abstract: The key limitation of the verification performance lies in the ability of error detection. With this intuition we designed several variants of pessimistic verification, which are simple workflows that could significantly improve the verification of open-ended math questions. In pessimistic verification we construct multiple parallel verifications for the same proof, and the proof is deemed incorrect if any one of them reports an error. This simple technique significantly improves the performance across many math verification benchmarks without incurring substantial computational resources. Its token efficiency even surpassed extended long-CoT in test-time scaling. Our case studies further indicate that the majority of false negatives in stronger models are actually caused by annotation errors in the original dataset, so our method's performance is in fact underestimated. Self-verification for mathematical problems can effectively improve the reliability and performance of language model outputs, and it also plays a critical role in enabling long-horizon mathematical tasks. We believe that research on pessimistic verification will help enhance the mathematical capabilities of language models across a wide range of tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型在专业角色扮演中能否可靠披露AI身份，因为如果模型无法在专家语境中表明自身能力边界，用户可能过度信任其虚假专业知识而受到伤害。

Method: 采用共同花园设计，对16个开源模型（4B-671B参数）进行19,200次试验审计，使用贝叶斯验证和Rogan-Gladen校正确保测量稳健性。

Result: 模型表现出显著的领域特定不一致性：金融顾问角色初始披露率为30.8%，而神经外科医生角色仅为3.5%；披露率范围从2.8%到73.6%；推理优化在某些模型中主动抑制了自我透明度。

Conclusion: 透明度反映的是训练因素而非规模，组织不能假设安全属性会转移到部署环境，需要刻意设计行为和实证验证。

Abstract: If a language model cannot reliably disclose its AI identity in expert contexts, users cannot trust its competence boundaries. This study examines self-transparency in models assigned professional personas within high-stakes domains where false expertise risks user harm. Using a common-garden design, sixteen open-weight models (4B--671B parameters) were audited across 19,200 trials. Models exhibited sharp domain-specific inconsistency: a Financial Advisor persona elicited 30.8% disclosure initially, while a Neurosurgeon persona elicited only 3.5%. This creates preconditions for a "Reverse Gell-Mann Amnesia" effect, where transparency in some domains leads users to overgeneralize trust to contexts where disclosure fails. Disclosure ranged from 2.8% to 73.6%, with a 14B model reaching 61.4% while a 70B produced just 4.1%. Model identity predicted behavior better than parameter count ($ΔR_{adj}^{2} = 0.359$ vs 0.018). Reasoning optimization actively suppressed self-transparency in some models, with reasoning variants showing up to 48.4% lower disclosure than base counterparts. Bayesian validation with Rogan--Gladen correction confirmed robustness to measurement error ($κ= 0.908$). These findings demonstrate transparency reflects training factors rather than scale. Organizations cannot assume safety properties transfer to deployment contexts, requiring deliberate behavior design and empirical verification.

Abstract: In an era marked by rapid technological advancements and complex global challenges, responsible foresight has emerged as an essential framework for policymakers aiming to navigate future uncertainties and shape the future. Responsible foresight entails the ethical anticipation of emerging opportunities and risks, with a focus on fostering proactive, sustainable, and accountable future design. This paper coins the term "responsible computational foresight", examining the role of human-centric artificial intelligence and computational modeling in advancing responsible foresight, establishing a set of foundational principles for this new field and presenting a suite of AI-driven foresight tools currently shaping it. AI, particularly in conjunction with simulations and scenario analysis, enhances policymakers' ability to address uncertainty, evaluate risks, and devise strategies geared toward sustainable, resilient futures. However, responsible foresight extends beyond mere technical forecasting; it demands a nuanced understanding of the interdependencies within social, environmental, economic and political systems, alongside a commitment to ethical, long-term decision-making that supports human intelligence. We argue that AI will play a role as a supportive tool in responsible, human-centered foresight, complementing rather than substituting policymaker judgment to enable the proactive shaping of resilient and ethically sound futures. This paper advocates for the thoughtful integration of AI into foresight practices to empower policymakers and communities as they confront the grand challenges of the 21st century.

*Charles Schepanowski,Charles Ling*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs在8拼图任务中表现出规划能力不足，即使有反馈和验证器辅助，仍无法有效解决需要状态跟踪和目标导向规划的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在规划和状态推理方面的真实能力，不依赖代码执行等外部工具，通过经典的8拼图任务进行精确评估。

Method: 测试4个模型在零样本、思维链、算法思维等提示条件下，结合分层纠正反馈和外部移动验证器。

Result: 反馈能提高部分模型成功率，但成功运行通常冗长且计算昂贵。即使有移动验证器，所有模型都无法解决任何拼图。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在规划方面存在显著局限，需要显式状态维护和结构化搜索机制才能取得进一步进展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive results on many benchmarks, yet their capacity for planning and stateful reasoning remains unclear. We study these abilities directly, without code execution or other tools, using the 8-puzzle: a classic task that requires state tracking and goal-directed planning while allowing precise, step-by-step evaluation. Four models are tested under common prompting conditions (Zero-Shot, Chain-of-Thought, Algorithm-of-Thought) and with tiered corrective feedback. Feedback improves success rates for some model-prompt combinations, but many successful runs are long, computationally expensive, and indirect. We then examine the models with an external move validator that provides only valid moves. Despite this level of assistance, none of the models solve any puzzles in this setting. Qualitative analysis reveals two dominant deficits across all models: (1) brittle internal state representations, leading to frequent invalid moves, and (2) weak heuristic planning, with models entering loops or selecting actions that do not reduce the distance to the goal state. These findings indicate that, in the absence of external tools such as code interpreters, current LLMs have substantial limitations in planning and that further progress may require mechanisms for maintaining explicit state and performing structured search.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个将系统动力学和结构方程建模结合到统一数学框架中的方法，用于为数据科学和AI/ML应用开发更负责任的人工智能系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI/ML模型在解决复杂问题的同时会放大人类偏见，需要更丰富的因果模型来指导负责任AI的发展。但不同方法基于不同基本假设，难以整合。

Method: 将系统动力学和结构方程建模整合到一个共同的数学框架中，用于从分布生成系统、开发方法并比较结果。

Result: 建立了一个统一的数学框架，能够弥合系统动力学和结构方程建模之间的方法论差异。

Conclusion: 该框架可以为数据科学和AI/ML应用提供系统动力学的认识论基础，促进更负责任的人工智能发展。

Abstract: AI/ML models have rapidly gained prominence as innovations for solving previously unsolved problems and their unintended consequences from amplifying human biases. Advocates for responsible AI/ML have sought ways to draw on the richer causal models of system dynamics to better inform the development of responsible AI/ML. However, a major barrier to advancing this work is the difficulty of bringing together methods rooted in different underlying assumptions (i.e., Dana Meadow's "the unavoidable a priori"). This paper brings system dynamics and structural equation modeling together into a common mathematical framework that can be used to generate systems from distributions, develop methods, and compare results to inform the underlying epistemology of system dynamics for data science and AI/ML applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于轨迹的记忆方法存在简洁性偏差，逐渐丢失关键领域知识，且仅记录单模态行为轨迹，无法保存视觉注意力和逻辑推理如何共同贡献于解决方案，这与人类的多模态整合语义记忆不符。

Method: 采用双流记忆框架，分别编码视觉分心模式和逻辑推理错误，遵循增长与精炼原则，逐步积累和更新多模态语义知识，保持稳定可泛化策略同时避免灾难性遗忘。

Result: 在六个多模态基准测试中，ViLoMem持续提升pass@1准确率，显著减少重复的视觉和逻辑错误。消融实验证实了具有明确分心-幻觉分离的双流记忆的必要性。

Conclusion: 错误感知的多模态记忆对于终身和跨领域代理学习具有重要价值，ViLoMem框架有效解决了现有记忆方法的局限性。

Abstract: MLLMs exhibit strong reasoning on isolated queries, yet they operate de novo -- solving each problem independently and often repeating the same mistakes. Existing memory-augmented agents mainly store past trajectories for reuse. However, trajectory-based memory suffers from brevity bias, gradually losing essential domain knowledge. More critically, even in truly multimodal problem-solving settings, it records only a single-modality trace of past behavior, failing to preserve how visual attention and logical reasoning jointly contributed to the solution. This is fundamentally misaligned with human cognition: semantic memory is both multimodal and integrated, preserving visual and abstract knowledge through coordinated but distinct representational streams. We thus introduce ViLoMem, a dual-stream memory framework that constructs compact, schema-based memory. It separately encodes visual distraction patterns and logical reasoning errors, enabling MLLMs to learn from their successful and failed experiences. Following a grow-and-refine principle, the system incrementally accumulates and updates multimodal semantic knowledge -- preserving stable, generalizable strategies while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Across six multimodal benchmarks, ViLoMem consistently improves pass@1 accuracy and substantially reduces repeated visual and logical errors. Ablations confirm the necessity of dual-stream memory with explicit distraction--hallucination separation, demonstrating the value of error-aware multimodal memory for lifelong and cross-domain agentic learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出ProNECL框架，通过原型引导的非样本持续学习解决跨个体EEG解码中的灾难性遗忘问题，无需存储历史EEG数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于EEG信号存在显著的个体间变异性，在持续EEG解码任务中引入新受试者时，先前获得的知识容易被覆盖。现有方法依赖存储历史数据作为回放缓冲区，但隐私问题和内存限制使得这种方法不实用。

Method: 构建类级别原型来总结每个受试者的判别性表示，通过跨受试者特征对齐和知识蒸馏，增量地将新特征空间与全局原型记忆对齐。

Result: 在BCI Competition IV 2a和2b数据集上验证，框架有效平衡了知识保留和适应性，在跨受试者持续EEG解码任务中实现了优越性能。

Conclusion: ProNECL框架能够在无需访问历史EEG样本的情况下保留先验知识，为跨个体EEG解码提供了一种实用且有效的持续学习解决方案。

Abstract: Due to the significant variability in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals across individuals, knowledge acquired from previous subjects is often overwritten as new subjects are introduced in continual EEG decoding task. Current works mainly rely on storing the historical data of seen subjects as a replay buffer to prevent forgetting. However, privacy concerns or memory constraints make keeping such data impractical. Instead, we propose a Prototype-guided Non-Exemplar Continual Learning (ProNECL)framework that preserves prior knowledge without accessing any historical EEG samples. ProNECL constructs class-level prototypes to summarize discriminative representations from each subject and incrementally aligns new feature spaces with the global prototype memory through cross-subject feature alignment and knowledge distillation. Validated on the BCI Competition IV 2a and 2b datasets, our framework effectively balances knowledge retention and adaptability, achieving superior performance in cross-subject continual EEG decoding tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的注意力机制——现代Hopfield注意力(MHA)，通过将现代Hopfield网络(MHN)的隐藏状态引入自注意力机制，建立了Hopfield网络与Transformer之间更广义的对应关系。


<details>

Motivation: 现有研究指出现代Hopfield网络在绝热近似下的状态更新规则与Transformer的自注意力层一致，但作者希望超越这一近似，探索两者之间更深层次的关系。

Method: 在自注意力机制中添加现代Hopfield网络衍生的隐藏状态变量，构建现代Hopfield注意力(MHA)机制，使注意力分数能够从Transformer输入层继承到输出层。

Result: 理论和实验证明MHA隐藏状态显著改善了深度Transformer的秩塌陷和token均匀性问题，且在不增加训练参数的情况下提高了Vision Transformer和GPT的准确率。

Conclusion: Hopfield网络为改进Transformer架构提供了一个有用的新视角，现代Hopfield注意力机制能够系统性提升模型性能。

Abstract: Associative memory models based on Hopfield networks and self-attention based on key-value mechanisms have been popular approaches in the study of memory mechanisms in deep learning. It has been pointed out that the state update rule of the modern Hopfield network (MHN) in the adiabatic approximation is in agreement with the self-attention layer of Transformer. In this paper, we go beyond this approximation and investigate the relationship between MHN and self-attention. Our results show that the correspondence between Hopfield networks and Transformers can be established in a more generalized form by adding a new variable, the hidden state derived from the MHN, to self-attention. This new attention mechanism, modern Hopfield attention (MHA), allows the inheritance of attention scores from the input layer of the Transformer to the output layer, which greatly improves the nature of attention weights. In particular, we show both theoretically and empirically that MHA hidden states significantly improve serious problem of deep Transformers known as rank collapse and token uniformity. We also confirm that MHA can systematically improve accuracy without adding training parameters to the Vision Transformer or GPT. Our results provide a new case in which Hopfield networks can be a useful perspective for improving the Transformer architecture.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在隐私敏感领域，剪枝后模型精度下降但无法访问原始训练数据进行微调，需要解决模型压缩与数据隐私之间的冲突。

Method: 使用DeepInversion技术，通过反转批归一化统计量从预训练教师模型中合成隐私保护的图像，作为知识蒸馏的传输集，将知识从教师网络传递到剪枝后的学生网络。

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上的实验表明，该方法在不同架构上显著恢复了剪枝导致的精度损失，且无需任何真实数据点。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了隐私约束下的模型剪枝问题，为数据受限环境下的模型压缩提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Model pruning is a widely adopted technique to reduce the computational complexity and memory footprint of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, global unstructured pruning often leads to significant degradation in accuracy, typically necessitating fine-tuning on the original training dataset to recover performance. In privacy-sensitive domains such as healthcare or finance, access to the original training data is often restricted post-deployment due to regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA). This paper proposes a Data-Free Knowledge Distillation framework to bridge the gap between model compression and data privacy. We utilize DeepInversion to synthesize privacy-preserving ``dream'' images from the pre-trained teacher model by inverting Batch Normalization (BN) statistics. These synthetic images serve as a transfer set to distill knowledge from the original teacher to the pruned student network. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 across various architectures (ResNet, MobileNet, VGG) demonstrate that our method significantly recovers accuracy lost during pruning without accessing a single real data point.

Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病早期准确诊断至关重要，但机器学习模型开发面临标记数据有限、多站点异质性和类别不平衡等挑战。

Method: 使用类别条件DDPM在NACC数据集上生成平衡诊断类别的合成数据，通过模态特定图Transformer编码器在合成数据上预学习鲁棒表示，然后在原始NACC数据上训练神经网络分类器。

Conclusion: 基于扩散的合成预训练与图Transformer结合可以改善低样本、不平衡临床预测环境中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Early and accurate detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial for enabling timely intervention and improving outcomes. However, developing reliable machine learning (ML) models for AD diagnosis is challenging due to limited labeled data, multi-site heterogeneity, and class imbalance. We propose a Transformer-based diagnostic framework that combines diffusion-based synthetic data generation with graph representation learning and transfer learning. A class-conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) is trained on the real-world NACC dataset to generate a large synthetic cohort that mirrors multimodal clinical and neuroimaging feature distributions while balancing diagnostic classes. Modality-specific Graph Transformer encoders are first pretrained on this synthetic data to learn robust, class-discriminative representations and are then frozen while a neural classifier is trained on embeddings from the original NACC data. We quantify distributional alignment between real and synthetic cohorts using metrics such as Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), Frechet distance, and energy distance, and complement discrimination metrics with calibration and fixed-specificity sensitivity analyses. Empirically, our framework outperforms standard baselines, including early and late fusion deep neural networks and the multimodal graph-based model MaGNet, yielding higher AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity under subject-wise cross-validation on NACC. These results show that diffusion-based synthetic pretraining with Graph Transformers can improve generalization in low-sample, imbalanced clinical prediction settings.

Conclusion: RePS为使用预训练扩散模型解决逆问题提供了一个通用、高效且计算成本低的框架，在多种设置下表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Inverse problems are fundamental to science and engineering, where the goal is to infer an underlying signal or state from incomplete or noisy measurements. Recent approaches employ diffusion models as powerful implicit priors for such problems, owing to their ability to capture complex data distributions. However, existing diffusion-based methods for inverse problems often rely on strong approximations of the posterior distribution, require computationally expensive gradient backpropagation through the score network, or are restricted to linear measurement models.
  In this work, we propose Restart for Posterior Sampling (RePS), a general and efficient framework for solving both linear and non-linear inverse problems using pre-trained diffusion models. RePS builds on the idea of restart-based sampling, previously shown to improve sample quality in unconditional diffusion, and extends it to posterior inference. Our method employs a conditioned ODE applicable to any differentiable measurement model and introduces a simplified restart strategy that contracts accumulated approximation errors during sampling. Unlike some of the prior approaches, RePS avoids backpropagation through the score network, substantially reducing computational cost.
  We demonstrate that RePS achieves faster convergence and superior reconstruction quality compared to existing diffusion-based baselines across a range of inverse problems, including both linear and non-linear settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出主动切片发现方法，通过主动学习算法识别LLMs在特定数据子集上的系统性错误，显著减少人工标注需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在特定数据子集上存在系统性错误，手动识别这些错误切片需要大量标注工作，需要更高效的发现方法。

Method: 使用主动学习算法结合不同特征表示，通过有限的人工验证来分组可能属于同一错误切片的样本。

Result: 不确定性主动学习算法效果最佳，仅使用2-10%的切片成员信息即可达到竞争性准确率，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 主动切片发现是识别模型错误模式的有效方法，能够大幅减少人工标注成本，在毒性分类任务中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit systematic errors on specific subsets of data, known as error slices. For instance, a slice can correspond to a certain demographic, where a model does poorly in identifying toxic comments regarding that demographic. Identifying error slices is crucial to understanding and improving models, but it is also challenging. An appealing approach to reduce the amount of manual annotation required is to actively group errors that are likely to belong to the same slice, while using limited access to an annotator to verify whether the chosen samples share the same pattern of model mistake. In this paper, we formalize this approach as Active Slice Discovery and explore it empirically on a problem of discovering human-defined slices in toxicity classification. We examine the efficacy of active slice discovery under different choices of feature representations and active learning algorithms. On several slices, we find that uncertainty-based active learning algorithms are most effective, achieving competitive accuracy using 2-10% of the available slice membership information, while significantly outperforming baselines.

Motivation: PPO在多轮对话和推理任务中训练LLMs时性能不稳定且容易崩溃，主要问题在于token级重要性采样与多轮环境结构不匹配，以及离策略样本导致的优势估计不准确。

Method: 引入两种互补的稳定技术：1) 轮级重要性采样，使优化与多轮推理的自然结构对齐；2) 裁剪偏差校正，通过降低不可靠离策略样本的权重来归一化梯度。组合得到三种变体：Turn-PPO、S-PPO和ST-PPO。

Result: 在通用QA、多跳QA和医疗多选题基准测试中，ST-PPO和S-PPO能防止大模型训练中的性能崩溃，保持较低的裁剪率，并获得比标准token级PPO更高的任务性能。

Conclusion: 轮级重要性采样与裁剪偏差校正相结合，为稳定多轮LLM智能体训练提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: PPO has been widely adopted for training large language models (LLMs) at the token level in multi-turn dialogue and reasoning tasks. However, its performance is often unstable and prone to collapse. Through empirical analysis, we identify two main sources of instability in this setting: (1)~token-level importance sampling, which is misaligned with the natural granularity of multi-turn environments that have distinct turn-level stages, and (2) inaccurate advantage estimates from off-policy samples, where the critic has not learned to evaluate certain state-action pairs, resulting in high-variance gradients and unstable updates. To address these challenges, we introduce two complementary stabilization techniques: (1) turn-level importance sampling, which aligns optimization with the natural structure of multi-turn reasoning, and (2) clipping-bias correction, which normalizes gradients by downweighting unreliable, highly off-policy samples. Depending on how these components are combined, we obtain three variants: Turn-PPO (turn-level sampling only), S-PPO (clipping-bias correction applied to token-level PPO), and ST-PPO (turn-level sampling combined with clipping-bias correction). In our experiments, we primarily study ST-PPO and S-PPO, which together demonstrate how the two stabilization mechanisms address complementary sources of instability. Experiments on multi-turn search tasks across general QA, multi-hop QA, and medical multiple-choice QA benchmarks show that ST-PPO and S-PPO consistently prevent the performance collapses observed in large-model training, maintain lower clipping ratios throughout optimization, and achieve higher task performance than standard token-level PPO. These results demonstrate that combining turn-level importance sampling with clipping-bias correction provides a practical and scalable solution for stabilizing multi-turn LLM agent training.

Abstract: Autonomous driving faces critical challenges in rare long-tail events and complex multi-agent interactions, which are scarce in real-world data yet essential for robust safety validation. This paper presents a high-fidelity scenario generation framework that integrates a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) with a large language model (LLM). The CVAE encodes historical trajectories and map information from large-scale naturalistic datasets to learn latent traffic structures, enabling the generation of physically consistent base scenarios. Building on this, the LLM acts as an adversarial reasoning engine, parsing unstructured scene descriptions into domain-specific loss functions and dynamically guiding scenario generation across varying risk levels. This knowledge-driven optimization balances realism with controllability, ensuring that generated scenarios remain both plausible and risk-sensitive. Extensive experiments in CARLA and SMARTS demonstrate that our framework substantially increases the coverage of high-risk and long-tail events, improves consistency between simulated and real-world traffic distributions, and exposes autonomous driving systems to interactions that are significantly more challenging than those produced by existing rule- or data-driven methods. These results establish a new pathway for safety validation, enabling principled stress-testing of autonomous systems under rare but consequential events.

Abstract: Globally interpretable models are a promising approach for trustworthy AI in safety-critical domains. Alongside global explanations, detailed local explanations are a crucial complement to effectively support human experts during inference. This work proposes the Calibrated Hierarchical QPM (CHiQPM) which offers uniquely comprehensive global and local interpretability, paving the way for human-AI complementarity. CHiQPM achieves superior global interpretability by contrastively explaining the majority of classes and offers novel hierarchical explanations that are more similar to how humans reason and can be traversed to offer a built-in interpretable Conformal prediction (CP) method. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that CHiQPM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy as a point predictor, maintaining 99% accuracy of non-interpretable models. This demonstrates a substantial improvement, where interpretability is incorporated without sacrificing overall accuracy. Furthermore, its calibrated set prediction is competitively efficient to other CP methods, while providing interpretable predictions of coherent sets along its hierarchical explanation.

Abstract: Recent advances in mechanistic interpretability have revealed that large language models (LLMs) develop internal representations corresponding not only to concrete entities but also distinct, human-understandable abstract concepts and behaviour. Moreover, these hidden features can be directly manipulated to steer model behaviour. However, it remains an open question whether this phenomenon is unique to models trained on inherently structured data (ie. language, images) or if it is a general property of foundation models. In this work, we investigate the internal representations of a large physics-focused foundation model. Inspired by recent work identifying single directions in activation space for complex behaviours in LLMs, we extract activation vectors from the model during forward passes over simulation datasets for different physical regimes. We then compute "delta" representations between the two regimes. These delta tensors act as concept directions in activation space, encoding specific physical features. By injecting these concept directions back into the model during inference, we can steer its predictions, demonstrating causal control over physical behaviours, such as inducing or removing some particular physical feature from a simulation. These results suggest that scientific foundation models learn generalised representations of physical principles. They do not merely rely on superficial correlations and patterns in the simulations. Our findings open new avenues for understanding and controlling scientific foundation models and has implications for AI-enabled scientific discovery.

Conclusion: 该方法为飞行测试等高风险、不确定性和人机交互场景提供了有效的运行时安全监控解决方案，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: We develop a data-driven approach for runtime safety monitoring in flight testing, where pilots perform maneuvers on aircraft with uncertain parameters. Because safety violations can arise unexpectedly as a result of these uncertainties, pilots need clear, preemptive criteria to abort the maneuver in advance of safety violation. To solve this problem, we use offline stochastic trajectory simulation to learn a calibrated statistical model of the short-term safety risk facing pilots. We use flight testing as a motivating example for data-driven learning/monitoring of safety due to its inherent safety risk, uncertainty, and human-interaction. However, our approach consists of three broadly-applicable components: a model to predict future state from recent observations, a nearest neighbor model to classify the safety of the predicted state, and classifier calibration via conformal prediction. We evaluate our method on a flight dynamics model with uncertain parameters, demonstrating its ability to reliably identify unsafe scenarios, match theoretical guarantees, and outperform baseline approaches in preemptive classification of risk.

Motivation: 研究初始猜测偏差对神经网络早期训练动态的影响，特别是不同损失函数如何与这种偏差相互作用。

Method: 分析未经训练神经网络在随机初始化后的类别偏好行为，研究Blurry和Piecewise-zero等损失函数在这种偏差下的表现。

Result: 初始猜测偏差确实存在，损失函数的选择对早期训练动态有显著影响，某些损失函数在存在初始偏差时可能无法有效指导训练方向。

Conclusion: 需要仔细考虑初始猜测偏差如何与训练方案的各个组件相互作用，损失函数的选择对早期训练阶段至关重要。

Abstract: Untrained large neural networks, just after random initialization, tend to favour a small subset of classes, assigning high predicted probabilities to these few classes and approximately zero probability to all others. This bias, termed Initial Guessing Bias, affects the early training dynamics, when the model is fitting to the coarse structure of the data. The choice of loss function against which to train the model has a large impact on how these early dynamics play out. Two recent loss functions, Blurry and Piecewise-zero loss, were designed for robustness to label errors but can become unable to steer the direction of training when exposed to this initial bias. Results indicate that the choice of loss function has a dramatic effect on the early phase training of networks, and highlights the need for careful consideration of how Initial Guessing Bias may interact with various components of the training scheme.

Abstract: The solar wind, a continuous outflow of charged particles from the Sun's corona, shapes the heliosphere and impacts space systems near Earth. Accurate prediction of features such as high-speed streams and coronal mass ejections is critical for space weather forecasting, but traditional three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models are computationally expensive, limiting rapid exploration of boundary condition uncertainties. We introduce the first autoregressive machine learning surrogate for steady-state solar wind radial velocity using the Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO). By predicting a limited radial range and iteratively propagating the solution outward, the model improves accuracy in distant regions compared to a single-step approach. Compared with the numerical HUX surrogate, SFNO demonstrates superior or comparable performance while providing a flexible, trainable, and data-driven alternative, establishing a novel methodology for high-fidelity solar wind modeling.

TL;DR: Primal是一个确定性的特征映射框架，利用素数平方根的数论独立性构建可调谐的向量表示，提供静态和动态两种算法变体，在低频率下作为等距核映射，在高频率下作为最大熵单向哈希。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统随机投影方法（如随机傅里叶特征）存在随机性，作者希望开发一种确定性的特征映射框架，利用素数平方根的数学特性来构建更稳健、可调谐的向量表示。

Method: 提出两种算法变体：StaticPrime（生成接近Welch边界准正交性的时序位置编码）和DynamicPrime（通过单一缩放参数σ统一两种数学效用类别的可调谐投影层）。

Result: 经验评估显示该框架在正交性保持和分布紧致性方面优于归一化高斯基线，成为随机矩阵投影的计算高效、数学严谨的替代方案。

Conclusion: Primal框架提供了一个确定性的、数学严谨的特征映射方法，能够根据需求在等距核映射和最大熵哈希之间灵活切换，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: We present Primal, a deterministic feature mapping framework that harnesses the number-theoretic independence of prime square roots to construct robust, tunable vector representations. Diverging from standard stochastic projections (e.g., Random Fourier Features), our method exploits the Besicovitch property to create irrational frequency modulations that guarantee infinite non-repeating phase trajectories. We formalize two distinct algorithmic variants: (1) StaticPrime, a sequence generation method that produces temporal position encodings empirically approaching the theoretical Welch bound for quasi-orthogonality; and (2) DynamicPrime, a tunable projection layer for input-dependent feature mapping. A central novelty of the dynamic framework is its ability to unify two disparate mathematical utility classes through a single scaling parameter σ. In the low-frequency regime, the method acts as an isometric kernel map, effectively linearizing non-convex geometries (e.g., spirals) to enable high-fidelity signal reconstruction and compressive sensing. Conversely, the high-frequency regime induces chaotic phase wrapping, transforming the projection into a maximum-entropy one-way hash suitable for Hyperdimensional Computing and privacy-preserving Split Learning. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our framework yields superior orthogonality retention and distribution tightness compared to normalized Gaussian baselines, establishing it as a computationally efficient, mathematically rigorous alternative to random matrix projections.

TL;DR: 使用自监督学习预训练特征提取器，然后在噪声标签数据集上进行标准监督训练，可以提高模型对标签噪声的鲁棒性，无需干净标签子集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度网络在有噪声标签的数据上训练会导致泛化能力差和准确率下降，因为模型会过拟合到标签噪声。现有方法通常依赖干净数据子集，但实际中可能难以获得。

Method: 首先使用SimCLR和Barlow Twins等自监督学习方法无标签预训练特征提取器，然后在噪声数据集上进行标准监督训练。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上的实验表明，自监督预训练在所有噪声率下都能持续提高分类准确率和下游标签错误检测性能（F1和平衡准确率）。噪声率越高，性能提升越明显。

Conclusion: 自监督预训练方法在低噪声水平下与ImageNet预训练模型表现相当，在高噪声条件下显著优于ImageNet预训练模型，证明了其对标签噪声的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Training deep networks with noisy labels leads to poor generalization and degraded accuracy due to overfitting to label noise. Existing approaches for learning with noisy labels often rely on the availability of a clean subset of data. By pre-training a feature extractor backbone without labels using self-supervised learning (SSL), followed by standard supervised training on the noisy dataset, we can train a more noise robust model without requiring a subset with clean labels. We evaluate the use of SimCLR and Barlow~Twins as SSL methods on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 under synthetic and real world noise. Across all noise rates, self-supervised pre-training consistently improves classification accuracy and enhances downstream label-error detection (F1 and Balanced Accuracy). The performance gap widens as the noise rate increases, demonstrating improved robustness. Notably, our approach achieves comparable results to ImageNet pre-trained models at low noise levels, while substantially outperforming them under high noise conditions.

Motivation: 状态重置是模拟器的基本能力，但在复杂模拟器中实现非平凡，特别是当模拟器包含潜在变量时。现有方法需要从信念状态中采样，而如何仅通过采样访问来选择近似信念状态采样器是一个重要问题。

Method: 将问题简化为一般条件分布选择任务，在仅采样访问下开发新算法和分析。提出了两种信念状态选择方法：基于潜在状态的选择和基于观测的选择，并分析了它们与Single-Reset和Repeated-Reset两种roll-out方法的交互。

Result: 发现两种选择方法在下游roll-out方法中的保证不同：基于观测的选择在Single-Reset方法下可能失败，但在Repeated-Reset方法下具有保证。揭示了算法选择、理论细微差别和开放问题的丰富景观。

Conclusion: 这个看似简单的问题实际上包含了丰富的算法选择、理论细微差别和开放问题，特别是在分布偏移、采样策略选择等方面需要进一步研究。

Abstract: State resetting is a fundamental but often overlooked capability of simulators. It supports sample-based planning by allowing resets to previously encountered simulation states, and enables calibration of simulators using real data by resetting to states observed in real-system traces. While often taken for granted, state resetting in complex simulators can be nontrivial: when the simulator comes with latent variables (states), state resetting requires sampling from the posterior over the latent state given the observable history, a.k.a. the belief state (Silver and Veness, 2010). While exact sampling is often infeasible, many approximate belief-state samplers can be constructed, raising the question of how to select among them using only sampling access to the simulator.
  In this paper, we show that this problem reduces to a general conditional distribution-selection task and develop a new algorithm and analysis under sampling-only access. Building on this reduction, the belief-state selection problem admits two different formulations: latent state-based selection, which directly targets the conditional distribution of the latent state, and observation-based selection, which targets the induced distribution over the observation. Interestingly, these formulations differ in how their guarantees interact with the downstream roll-out methods: perhaps surprisingly, observation-based selection may fail under the most natural roll-out method (which we call Single-Reset) but enjoys guarantees under the less conventional alternative (which we call Repeated-Reset). Together with discussion on issues such as distribution shift and the choice of sampling policies, our paper reveals a rich landscape of algorithmic choices, theoretical nuances, and open questions, in this seemingly simple problem.

TL;DR: 提出了一种评估动态图表示完整性的框架，通过三个合成场景测试了42个候选指标，推荐了一个经过验证的指标来评估嵌入变化是否忠实反映图结构变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基准仅通过任务特定分数评估动态图学习器，很少关注嵌入本身是否能真实反映网络演化。需要衡量表示完整性来确保嵌入变化忠实跟随图变化。

Method: 形式化表示完整性概念，推导出一系列指标来衡量嵌入变化与图变化的一致性。使用三个合成场景（渐进合并、突然移动、周期性重连）筛选42个候选指标。

Result: 推荐了一个经过理论和实证验证的指标，该指标始终将可证明稳定的UASE和IPP模型排名最高。神经方法在特定场景下表现优势，且与一步链接预测AUC呈强正相关。

Conclusion: 提出的完整性框架为动态图表示质量提供了任务无关且可解释的评估工具，为模型选择和未来架构设计提供更明确的指导。

Abstract: Real-world systems ranging from airline routes to cryptocurrency transfers are naturally modelled as dynamic graphs whose topology changes over time. Conventional benchmarks judge dynamic-graph learners by a handful of task-specific scores, yet seldom ask whether the embeddings themselves remain a truthful, interpretable reflection of the evolving network. We formalize this requirement as representation integrity and derive a family of indexes that measure how closely embedding changes follow graph changes. Three synthetic scenarios, Gradual Merge, Abrupt Move, and Periodic Re-wiring, are used to screen forty-two candidate indexes. Based on which we recommend one index that passes all of our theoretical and empirical tests. In particular, this validated metric consistently ranks the provably stable UASE and IPP models highest. We then use this index to do a comparative study on representation integrity of common dynamic graph learning models. This study exposes the scenario-specific strengths of neural methods, and shows a strong positive rank correlation with one-step link-prediction AUC. The proposed integrity framework, therefore, offers a task-agnostic and interpretable evaluation tool for dynamic-graph representation quality, providing more explicit guidance for model selection and future architecture design.

Abstract: We study streaming data with categorical features where the vocabulary of categorical feature values is changing and can even grow unboundedly over time. Feature hashing is commonly used as a pre-processing step to map these categorical values into a feature space of fixed size before learning their embeddings. While these methods have been developed and evaluated for offline or batch settings, in this paper we consider online settings. We show that deterministic embeddings are sensitive to the arrival order of categories and suffer from forgetting in online learning, leading to performance deterioration. To mitigate this issue, we propose a probabilistic hash embedding (PHE) model that treats hash embeddings as stochastic and applies Bayesian online learning to learn incrementally from data. Based on the structure of PHE, we derive a scalable inference algorithm to learn model parameters and infer/update the posteriors of hash embeddings and other latent variables. Our algorithm (i) can handle an evolving vocabulary of categorical items, (ii) is adaptive to new items without forgetting old items, (iii) is implementable with a bounded set of parameters that does not grow with the number of distinct observed values on the stream, and (iv) is invariant to the item arrival order. Experiments in classification, sequence modeling, and recommendation systems in online learning setups demonstrate the superior performance of PHE while maintaining high memory efficiency (consumes as low as 2~4 memory of a one-hot embedding table).

Conclusion: 演化样本权重能产生更好的公平性-性能权衡，但优化目标的选择对效果有重要影响，准确率和人口统计均等差异的组合效果最佳。

Abstract: Machine learning models trained on real-world data may inadvertently make biased predictions that negatively impact marginalized communities. Reweighting is a method that can mitigate such bias in model predictions by assigning a weight to each data point used during model training. In this paper, we compare three methods for generating these weights: (1) evolving them using a Genetic Algorithm (GA), (2) computing them using only dataset characteristics, and (3) assigning equal weights to all data points. Model performance under each strategy was evaluated using paired predictive and fairness metrics, which also served as optimization objectives for the GA during evolution. Specifically, we used two predictive metrics (accuracy and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) and two fairness metrics (demographic parity difference and subgroup false negative fairness). Using experiments on eleven publicly available datasets (including two medical datasets), we show that evolved sample weights can produce models that achieve better trade-offs between fairness and predictive performance than alternative weighting methods. However, the magnitude of these benefits depends strongly on the choice of optimization objectives. Our experiments reveal that optimizing with accuracy and demographic parity difference metrics yields the largest number of datasets for which evolved weights are significantly better than other weighting strategies in optimizing both objectives.

Abstract: Existing studies on reinforcement learning (RL) for sepsis management have mostly followed an established problem setup, in which patient data are aggregated into 4-hour time steps. Although concerns have been raised regarding the coarseness of this time-step size, which might distort patient dynamics and lead to suboptimal treatment policies, the extent to which this is a problem in practice remains unexplored. In this work, we conducted empirical experiments for a controlled comparison of four time-step sizes ($Δt\!=\!1,2,4,8$ h) on this domain, following an identical offline RL pipeline. To enable a fair comparison across time-step sizes, we designed action re-mapping methods that allow for evaluation of policies on datasets with different time-step sizes, and conducted cross-$Δt$ model selections under two policy learning setups. Our goal was to quantify how time-step size influences state representation learning, behavior cloning, policy training, and off-policy evaluation. Our results show that performance trends across $Δt$ vary as learning setups change, while policies learned at finer time-step sizes ($Δt = 1$ h and $2$ h) using a static behavior policy achieve the overall best performance and stability. Our work highlights time-step size as a core design choice in offline RL for healthcare and provides evidence supporting alternatives beyond the conventional 4-hour setup.

Conclusion: 通过鼓励轴对齐的不连续性，Cliff方法成功地将理论原理转化为实用的无监督解缠标准，并在多个基准测试中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Recent theoretical work established the unsupervised identifiability of quantized factors under any diffeomorphism. The theory assumes that quantization thresholds correspond to axis-aligned discontinuities in the probability density of the latent factors. By constraining a learned map to have a density with axis-aligned discontinuities, we can recover the quantization of the factors. However, translating this high-level principle into an effective practical criterion remains challenging, especially under nonlinear maps. Here, we develop a criterion for unsupervised disentanglement by encouraging axis-aligned discontinuities. Discontinuities manifest as sharp changes in the estimated density of factors and form what we call cliffs. Following the definition of independent discontinuities from the theory, we encourage the location of the cliffs along a factor to be independent of the values of the other factors. We show that our method, Cliff, outperforms the baselines on all disentanglement benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in unsupervised disentanglement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BEC攻击造成巨大经济损失（每年29亿美元），存在显著的经济不对称性：漏报成本远高于误报成本（1:5480），需要开发有效的检测方案。

Method: 提出两种检测范式：1）法证心理语言学流使用CatBoost分析心理语言学特征；2）语义流使用DistilBERT进行深度学习上下文理解。在对抗性数据集（N=7,990）上评估，使用Tesla T4 GPU基础设施。

Conclusion: 有GPU基础设施的组织推荐使用DistilBERT获得更高精度；边缘部署或成本敏感环境推荐CatBoost，两者通过成本敏感学习优化后投资回报率均超过99.96%。

Abstract: Business Email Compromise (BEC) is a sophisticated social engineering threat that manipulates organizational hierarchies and exploits psychological vulnerabilities, leading to significant financial damage. According to the 2024 FBI Internet Crime Report, BEC accounts for over $2.9 billion in annual adjusted losses, presenting significant economic asymmetry: the cost of a False Negative (fraud loss) exceeds the cost of a False Positive (manual review) by orders of magnitude (approximately 1 to 5,480).
  This paper examines two detection paradigms for BEC: the Forensic Psycholinguistic Stream, which utilizes CatBoost to analyze psycholinguistic cues with high interpretability and low latency, and the Semantic Stream, which employs DistilBERT for deep learning-based contextual language understanding, offering superior accuracy at higher computational cost. We evaluated DistilBERT on an adversarially poisoned dataset (N = 7,990) generated via our Black Hole protocol, benchmarked on Tesla T4 GPU infrastructure, achieving superior detection (AUC = 1.0000, F1 = 0.9981) with acceptable real-time latency (7.403 milliseconds). CatBoost achieves competitive detection (AUC = 0.9905, F1 = 0.9486) at 8.4x lower latency (0.885 milliseconds), consuming negligible computational resources. For organizations with GPU infrastructure, DistilBERT offers superior accuracy. CatBoost is preferable for edge deployments or cost-sensitive environments due to comparable security and lower operational costs. Both approaches demonstrate return on investment exceeding 99.96% when optimized through cost-sensitive learning, by significantly reducing false negatives and associated financial losses.

Abstract: Behavior Cloning (BC) is a popular framework for training sequential decision policies from expert demonstrations via supervised learning. As these policies are increasingly being deployed in the real world, their robustness and potential vulnerabilities are an important concern. In this work, we perform the first analysis of the efficacy of clean-label backdoor attacks on BC policies. Our backdoor attacks poison a dataset of demonstrations by injecting a visual trigger to create a spurious correlation that can be exploited at test time. We evaluate how policy vulnerability scales with the fraction of poisoned data, the strength of the trigger, and the trigger type. We also introduce a novel entropy-based test-time trigger attack that substantially degrades policy performance by identifying critical states where test-time triggering of the backdoor is expected to be most effective at degrading performance. We empirically demonstrate that BC policies trained on even minimally poisoned datasets exhibit deceptively high, near-baseline task performance despite being highly vulnerable to backdoor trigger attacks during deployment. Our results underscore the urgent need for more research into the robustness of BC policies, particularly as large-scale datasets are increasingly used to train policies for real-world cyber-physical systems.

Conclusion: SGA-ACR通过结构化知识集成和多LLM协作规划，成功解决了LLM在强化学习中的规划-执行不对齐问题，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer strong high-level planning capabilities for reinforcement learning (RL) by decomposing tasks into subgoals. However, their practical utility is limited by poor planning-execution alignment, which reflects a critical gap between abstract plans and actionable, environment-compatible behaviors. This misalignment arises from two interrelated limitations: (1) LLMs often produce subgoals that are semantically plausible but infeasible or irrelevant in the target environment due to insufficient grounding in environment-specific knowledge, and (2) single-LLM planning conflates generation with self-verification, resulting in overconfident yet unreliable subgoals that frequently fail during execution. To address these challenges, we propose Subgoal Graph-Augmented Actor-Critic-Refiner (SGA-ACR), a framework that integrates an environment-specific subgoal graph and structured entity knowledge with a multi-LLM planning pipeline that explicitly separates generation, critique, and refinement to produce executable and verifiable subgoals. A subgoal tracker further monitors execution progress, provides auxiliary rewards, and adaptively updates the subgoal graph to maintain alignment between plans and actions. Experimental results on 22 diverse tasks in the open-world game "Crafter" demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Conclusion: FANoise通过特征自适应噪声注入有效缓解了噪声的负面影响，同时保留了其益处，为表示学习提供了理论支撑的改进框架。

Abstract: Representation learning is fundamental to modern machine learning, powering applications such as text retrieval and multimodal understanding. However, learning robust and generalizable representations remains challenging. While prior work has demonstrated that active noise injection, a form of data augmentation, can enhance encoding performance, most existing methods rely on heuristic or static noise, overlooking the dynamic nature of feature distributions during training. In this work, we systematically study the role of noise in representation learning from both gradient-based and feature distribution perspectives, using InfoNCE loss as a representative example. Focusing on multimodal representation learning, we propose FANoise, a novel feature-adaptive noise injection strategy. By leveraging the dynamics of contrastive learning, FANoise effectively mitigates the negative impacts of noise while preserving its benefits. Under this theoretically grounded framework, comprehensive experiments demonstrate that FANoise consistently improves overall performance on multimodal tasks across various base VLM models.

### [221] [Estimating Ising Models in Total Variation Distance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21008)
*Constantinos Daskalakis,Vardis Kandiros,Rui Yao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个统一框架来分析Ising模型的最大伪似然估计器(MPLE)，针对两类广义Ising模型：具有有界算子范数且满足修正对数Sobolev不等式(MLSI)的模型，以及具有有界无穷范数(有界宽度)的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Ising模型的统计复杂性已被充分理解，但在总变差(TV)距离下寻找计算和统计效率高的估计算法仍然具有挑战性。现有研究主要集中在特定设置下，缺乏统一的多项式时间估计框架。

Method: 使用最大伪似然估计器(MPLE)，并采用张量化不等式、测度分解和集中界等多种工具进行统一分析。

Result: 为两类广义Ising模型提供了多项式时间算法和最优或接近最优的样本复杂度保证，涵盖多种设置。

Conclusion: 该研究为Ising模型的TV距离估计提供了一个统一的分析框架，填补了现有文献中的空白，并在多个设置下实现了计算和统计效率的平衡。

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating Ising models over $n$ variables in Total Variation (TV) distance, given $l$ independent samples from the model. While the statistical complexity of the problem is well-understood [DMR20], identifying computationally and statistically efficient algorithms has been challenging. In particular, remarkable progress has occurred in several settings, such as when the underlying graph is a tree [DP21, BGPV21], when the entries of the interaction matrix follow a Gaussian distribution [GM24, CK24], or when the bulk of its eigenvalues lie in a small interval [AJK+24, KLV24], but no unified framework for polynomial-time estimation in TV exists so far. Our main contribution is a unified analysis of the Maximum Pseudo-Likelihood Estimator (MPLE) for two general classes of Ising models. The first class includes models that have bounded operator norm and satisfy the Modified Log-Sobolev Inequality (MLSI), a functional inequality that was introduced to study the convergence of the associated Glauber dynamics to stationarity. In the second class of models, the interaction matrix has bounded infinity norm (or bounded width), which is the most common assumption in the literature for structure learning of Ising models. We show how our general results for these classes yield polynomial-time algorithms and optimal or near-optimal sample complexity guarantees in a variety of settings. Our proofs employ a variety of tools from tensorization inequalities to measure decompositions and concentration bounds.

Abstract: The challenge of separating AI-generated text from human-authored content is becoming more urgent as generative AI technologies like ChatGPT become more widely available. In this work, we address this issue by looking at both the detection of content that has been entirely generated by AI and the identification of human text that has been reworded by AI. In our work, a comprehensive methodology to detect AI- generated text using XLM-RoBERTa, a state-of-the-art multilingual transformer model. Our approach includes rigorous preprocessing, and feature extraction involving perplexity, semantic, and readability features. We fine-tuned the XLM-RoBERTa model on a balanced dataset of human and AI-generated texts and evaluated its performance. The model demonstrated high accuracy and robust performance across various text genres. Additionally, we conducted feature analysis to understand the model's decision-making process, revealing that perplexity and attention-based features are critical in differentiating between human and AI-generated texts. Our findings offer a valuable tool for maintaining academic integrity and contribute to the broader field of AI ethics by promoting transparency and accountability in AI systems. Future research directions include exploring other advanced models and expanding the dataset to enhance the model's generalizability.

Motivation: 在GPU大规模并行模拟环境中，为最大化吞吐量通常使用短rollout，但这会导致同步重置引入有害的非平稳性，扭曲学习信号并破坏训练稳定性。

Method: 引入交错重置技术，让环境在任务时间轴的不同点进行初始化和重置，从而产生具有更大时间多样性的训练批次。

Conclusion: 交错重置是一种简单有效的技术，能够缓解同步rollout带来的非平稳性问题，提升强化学习训练的效果和效率。

Abstract: Massively parallel GPU simulation environments have accelerated reinforcement learning (RL) research by enabling fast data collection for on-policy RL algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). To maximize throughput, it is common to use short rollouts per policy update, increasing the update-to-data (UTD) ra- tio. However, we find that, in this setting, standard synchronous resets introduce harmful nonstationarity, skewing the learning signal and destabilizing training. We introduce staggered resets, a simple yet effective technique where environments are initialized and reset at varied points within the task horizon. This yields training batches with greater temporal diversity, reducing the nonstationarity induced by synchronized rollouts. We characterize dimensions along which RL environments can benefit significantly from staggered resets through illustrative toy environ- ments. We then apply this technique to challenging high-dimensional robotics environments, achieving significantly higher sample efficiency, faster wall-clock convergence, and stronger final performance. Finally, this technique scales better with more parallel environments compared to naive synchronized rollouts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Gated KalmaNet (GKA) 是一种高效的线性状态空间模型层，通过在线岭回归解决SSM在召回任务中的性能不足问题，同时保持常数内存和线性计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统线性状态空间模型(SSM)虽然计算效率高，但只能维护有损的、衰减的过去信息摘要，在召回导向任务中表现不佳。

Method: 采用在线岭回归方法，结合卡尔曼滤波器思想，但通过自适应正则化策略和Chebyshev迭代解决数值稳定性和并行化问题，并开发硬件感知的分块实现。

Result: 在短上下文任务中超越现有SSM层(Mamba2、GLA等)，在128k令牌的长上下文RAG和LongQA任务中相对基线提升超过10%。

Conclusion: GKA在保持SSM效率的同时，显著提升了召回任务的性能，特别是在长上下文场景中表现出色。

Abstract: As efficient alternatives to softmax Attention, linear state-space models (SSMs) achieve constant memory and linear compute, but maintain only a lossy, fading summary of the past, often leading to inferior performance in recall oriented tasks. We propose Gated KalmaNet (GKA), a layer that reduces this gap by accounting for the full past when predicting the next token, while maintaining SSM-style efficiency. GKA achieves this by solving an online ridge regression problem at test time, with constant memory and linear compute cost in the sequence length. Drawing inspiration from the Kalman Filter, we iteratively solve the online ridge regression problem. However, a critical insight is that standard Kalman filter equations are numerically unstable in low-precision environments (like bfloat16) and difficult to parallelize in modern hardware. We address both challenges through two key innovations: (1) an adaptive regularization strategy with input-dependent gating that controls the condition number of the ridge regression, ensuring numerical stability while balancing memory retention. And (2) the use of Chebyshev Iteration instead of other conventional iterative solvers, which we demonstrate to be more stable in low-precision settings. To further improve scalability, we develop a hardware-aware chunk-wise implementation of Chebyshev Iteration along with custom kernels for backpropagating through our adaptive regularization and gating mechanisms. Empirically, GKA shows strong language understanding capabilites on short-context tasks outperforming existing SSM layers (like Mamba2, GLA and Gated DeltaNet). On long-context, GKA excels at real-world RAG and LongQA tasks up to 128k tokens, achieving more than $10$% relative improvement over other fading memory baselines.

Abstract: Climate change has intensified the frequency and severity of wildfires, making rapid and accurate prediction of fire spread essential for effective mitigation and response. Physics-based simulators such as FARSITE offer high-fidelity predictions but are computationally intensive, limiting their applicability in real-time decision-making, while existing deep learning models often yield overly smooth predictions that fail to capture the complex, nonlinear dynamics of wildfire propagation. This study proposes an autoregressive conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) for probabilistic wildfire spread prediction. By formulating the prediction task as an autoregressive problem, the model learns sequential state transitions, ensuring long-term prediction stability. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CGAN-based model outperforms conventional deep learning models in both overall predictive accuracy and boundary delineation of fire perimeters. These results demonstrate that adversarial learning allows the model to capture the strong nonlinearity and uncertainty of wildfire spread, instead of simply fitting the pixel average. Furthermore, the autoregressive framework facilitates systematic temporal forecasting of wildfire evolution. The proposed CGAN-based autoregressive framework enhances both the accuracy and physical interpretability of wildfire spread prediction, offering a promising foundation for time-sensitive response and evacuation planning.

Conclusion: ELBO$\text{TDS}$框架有效解决了推荐系统中的时间分布偏移问题，既能捕获稳定模式又能适应瞬态变化，适合工业级增量学习流水线

Abstract: Temporal distribution shift (TDS) erodes the long-term accuracy of recommender systems, yet industrial practice still relies on periodic incremental training, which struggles to capture both stable and transient patterns. Existing approaches such as invariant learning and self-supervised learning offer partial solutions but often suffer from unstable temporal generalization, representation collapse, or inefficient data utilization. To address these limitations, we propose ELBO$_\text{TDS}$, a probabilistic framework that integrates seamlessly into industry-scale incremental learning pipelines. First, we identify key shifting factors through statistical analysis of real-world production data and design a simple yet effective data augmentation strategy that resamples these time-varying factors to extend the training support. Second, to harness the benefits of this extended distribution while preventing representation collapse, we model the temporal recommendation scenario using a causal graph and derive a self-supervised variational objective, ELBO$_\text{TDS}$, grounded in the causal structure. Extensive experiments supported by both theoretical and empirical analysis demonstrate that our method achieves superior temporal generalization, yielding a 2.33\% uplift in GMV per user and has been successfully deployed in Shopee Product Search.

Abstract: Dairy farmers should decide to keep or cull a cow based on an objective assessment of her likely performance in the herd. For this purpose, farmers need to identify more resilient cows, which can cope better with farm conditions and complete more lactations. This decision-making process is inherently complex, with significant environmental and economic implications. In this study, we develop an AI-driven model to predict cow longevity using historical multivariate time-series data recorded from birth. Leveraging advanced AI techniques, specifically Multi-Head Attention Transformers, we analysed approximately 780,000 records from 19,000 unique cows across 7 farms in Australia. The results demonstrate that our model achieves an overall determination coefficient of 83% in predicting herd life across the studied farms, highlighting its potential for practical application in dairy herd management.

Abstract: Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) is a core technology for future wireless communication systems, enabling the identification of modulation schemes without prior knowledge. This capability is essential for applications in cognitive radio, spectrum monitoring, and intelligent communication networks. We propose an AMC system based on a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture, integrated with a Software Defined Radio (SDR) platform. The proposed architecture leverages CNNs for spatial feature extraction and LSTMs for capturing temporal dependencies, enabling efficient handling of complex, time-varying communication signals. The system's practical ability was demonstrated by identifying over-the-air (OTA) signals from a custom-built FM transmitter alongside other modulation schemes. The system was trained on a hybrid dataset combining the RadioML2018 dataset with a custom-generated dataset, featuring samples at Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) from 0 to 30dB. System performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC). The optimized model achieved 93.48% accuracy, 93.53% precision, 93.48% recall, and an F1 score of 93.45%. The AUC-ROC analysis confirmed the model's discriminative power, even in noisy conditions. This paper's experimental results validate the effectiveness of the hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture for AMC, suggesting its potential application in adaptive spectrum management and advanced cognitive radio systems.

Conclusion: FedAPA通过自适应原型聚合和混合学习目标，有效解决了联邦学习中的异构性问题，显著提升了Wi-Fi CSI感知的性能和效率。

Abstract: Wi-Fi channel state information (CSI)-based sensing provides a non-invasive, device-free approach for tasks such as human activity recognition and crowd counting, but large-scale deployment is hindered by the need for extensive site-specific training data. Federated learning (FL) offers a way to avoid raw data sharing but is challenged by heterogeneous sensing data and device resources. This paper proposes FedAPA, a collaborative Wi-Fi CSI-based sensing algorithm that uses adaptive prototype aggregation (APA) strategy to assign similarity-based weights to peer prototypes, enabling adaptive client contributions and yielding a personalized global prototype for each client instead of a fixed-weight aggregation. During local training, we adopt a hybrid objective that combines classification learning with representation contrastive learning to align local and global knowledge. We provide a convergence analysis of FedAPA and evaluate it in a real-world distributed Wi-Fi crowd counting scenario with six environments and up to 20 people. The results show that our method outperform multiple baselines in terms of accuracy, F1 score, mean absolute error (MAE), and communication overhead, with FedAPA achieving at least a 9.65% increase in accuracy, a 9% gain in F1 score, a 0.29 reduction in MAE, and a 95.94% reduction in communication overhead.

Motivation: 传统微调方法（如SFT和RLHF）存在安全与能力的基本权衡问题，即使使用良性数据集，提高任务性能也会降低安全对齐性。RLVR作为一种有前景的替代方法，但其安全性影响尚未被探索。

Method: 通过理论分析推导KL约束优化下的安全漂移上界，并证明消除安全退化的条件。在五个对抗性安全基准上进行广泛的实证实验，包括优化算法、模型规模和任务领域的消融研究。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了安全与能力必然权衡的普遍假设，确立了特定训练方法可以同时实现这两个目标，为安全部署具备推理能力的LLM提供了见解。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for downstream tasks typically exhibit a fundamental safety-capability tradeoff, where improving task performance degrades safety alignment even on benign datasets. This degradation persists across standard approaches including supervised finetuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). While reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising alternative that optimizes models on objectively measurable tasks, its safety implications remain unexplored. We present the first comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis of safety properties in RLVR. Theoretically, we derive upper bounds on safety drift under KL-constrained optimization and prove conditions under which safety degradation is eliminated. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments across five adversarial safety benchmarks, demonstrating that RLVR can simultaneously enhance reasoning capabilities while maintaining or improving safety guardrails. Our comprehensive ablation studies examine the effects of optimization algorithms, model scale, and task domains. Our findings challenge the prevailing assumption of an inevitable safety capability trade-off, and establish that a specific training methodology can achieve both objectives simultaneously, providing insights for the safe deployment of reasoning-capable LLMs.

TL;DR: Temporal Diffusion Planner (TDP) 通过在时间维度上分布去噪步骤来提高扩散规划的决策效率，相比每步重新生成计划的传统方法，决策频率提升11-24.8倍且性能相当或更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散规划方法每步重新生成计划导致计算开销大、决策频率低，而人类会制定详细短期计划和模糊长期计划并随时间调整，这启发了TDP的设计。

Method: TDP生成随时间逐渐模糊的初始计划，后续时间步仅用少量去噪步骤更新前一步计划而非重新生成，并引入自动重新规划机制防止计划与现实偏差过大。

Result: 在D4RL基准测试中，TDP相比每步重新生成计划的方法，决策频率提升11-24.8倍，同时达到相当或更好的性能。

Conclusion: TDP通过时间维度分布去噪步骤和自动重新规划机制，显著提高了扩散规划的决策效率，为实际应用提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion planning is a promising method for learning high-performance policies from offline data. To avoid the impact of discrepancies between planning and reality on performance, previous works generate new plans at each time step. However, this incurs significant computational overhead and leads to lower decision frequencies, and frequent plan switching may also affect performance. In contrast, humans might create detailed short-term plans and more general, sometimes vague, long-term plans, and adjust them over time. Inspired by this, we propose the Temporal Diffusion Planner (TDP) which improves decision efficiency by distributing the denoising steps across the time dimension. TDP begins by generating an initial plan that becomes progressively more vague over time. At each subsequent time step, rather than generating an entirely new plan, TDP updates the previous one with a small number of denoising steps. This reduces the average number of denoising steps, improving decision efficiency. Additionally, we introduce an automated replanning mechanism to prevent significant deviations between the plan and reality. Experiments on D4RL show that, compared to previous works that generate new plans every time step, TDP improves the decision-making frequency by 11-24.8 times while achieving higher or comparable performance.

Abstract: Offline data selection and online self-refining generation, which enhance the data quality, are crucial steps in adapting large language models (LLMs) to specific downstream tasks. We tackle offline data selection and online self-refining generations through an optimization perspective. Specifically, bilevel data selection is used for offline data selection with respect to the validation dataset, and we treat online self-refining generation as a model adaptation step of selecting the model trained on current responses that best fits the validation data. Our framework offers a unified understanding of offline data selection and self-refining generation by assigning a learned data weight to each question and response, either explicitly or implicitly. For the first time, we theoretically demonstrate the effectiveness of the bilevel data selection framework and demonstrate its performance gains over unfiltered direct mixing baselines. By combining offline data with validation-weighted online generations, our method enhances fine-tuning performance. Experiments on quality enhancement and safety-aware LLM fine-tuning validate its effectiveness.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于超维计算的随机化二进制神经网络构建方法G-Nets，通过高维向量表示实现二进制嵌入，在保持浮点网络精度的同时提供理论保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受大脑启发的超维计算范式，利用高维向量表示实现高效硬件部署和对模型损坏的鲁棒性，为构建二进制神经网络提供新思路。

Method: 将数据二进制嵌入到超立方体中，使用汉明距离，提出G-Nets家族，每个浮点G-Net都有随机化的二进制嵌入版本（EHD G-Net），基于测度集中理论保证精度。

Result: 二进制模型匹配CNN精度，在CIFAR-10上比先前HDC模型准确率提高近30%，大幅超越先前HDC模型性能。

Conclusion: G-Nets为神经网络和随机化二进制神经网络之间建立了理论桥梁，为构建鲁棒的二进制/量化深度学习模型开辟了新方向。

Abstract: We propose a novel randomized algorithm for constructing binary neural networks with tunable accuracy. This approach is motivated by hyperdimensional computing (HDC), which is a brain-inspired paradigm that leverages high-dimensional vector representations, offering efficient hardware implementation and robustness to model corruptions. Unlike traditional low-precision methods that use quantization, we consider binary embeddings of data as points in the hypercube equipped with the Hamming distance. We propose a novel family of floating-point neural networks, G-Nets, which are general enough to mimic standard network layers. Each floating-point G-Net has a randomized binary embedding, an embedded hyperdimensional (EHD) G-Net, that retains the accuracy of its floating-point counterparts, with theoretical guarantees, due to the concentration of measure. Empirically, our binary models match convolutional neural network accuracies and outperform prior HDC models by large margins, for example, we achieve almost 30\% higher accuracy on CIFAR-10 compared to prior HDC models. G-Nets are a theoretically justified bridge between neural networks and randomized binary neural networks, opening a new direction for constructing robust binary/quantized deep learning models. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/GNet2025/GNet.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出平衡微调(BFT)方法，通过双层加权机制解决生物医学领域LLM微调中的过拟合和稀疏数据学习问题，无需外部奖励信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在生物医学LLM微调中存在两个主要问题：标准SFT容易过拟合到表面指令模式而无法内化碎片化科学知识；RL方法因需要实验验证奖励而不实用。

Method: BFT采用双层加权机制：1) 令牌级别通过预测概率缩放损失来稳定梯度防止过拟合；2) 样本级别使用"最小组置信度"自适应增强困难样本学习。

Result: BFT显著优于SFT，在医学任务中能学到SFT遗漏的知识，在生物学任务中超越GeneAgent。BFT生成的文本嵌入可直接用于下游任务如基因相互作用和单细胞扰动响应预测。

Conclusion: BFT促进了LLM在生物医学研究中的广泛应用，能够从稀疏数据中有效学习复杂推理。

Abstract: Effective post-training is essential to align Large Language Models (LLMs) with specialized biomedical knowledge to accelerate life science research. However, current approaches face significant limitations. First, biomedical reasoning involves intricate mechanisms often represented by sparse textual data. Standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tends to overfit to surface-level instruction patterns without effectively internalizing this fragmented scientific knowledge. Second, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is impractical for this domain, as defining meaningful rewards often necessitates prohibitive experimental validation (e.g., wet-lab verification of drug responses), rendering real-time feedback unfeasible. We propose Balanced Fine-Tuning (BFT), an efficient post-training method designed to learn complex reasoning from sparse data without external reward signals. BFT operates through a two-layer weighting mechanism: 1. At the token level, it scales loss via prediction probabilities to stabilize gradients and prevent overfitting; 2. At the sample level, it uses "minimum group confidence" to adaptively enhance the learning of hard samples. Experiments demonstrate that BFT significantly outperforms SFT. In medical tasks, it enables LLMs to acquire knowledge that SFT misses. In biological tasks, BFT-based LLMs surpass GeneAgent (an accurate agent for biology analysis) in biological process reasoning. Moreover, the text embeddings generated by BFT can be directly applied to downstream tasks, such as gene interaction and single-cell perturbation response prediction. These results indicate that BFT facilitates broad applications of LLMs in biomedical research.

*Aaditya L. Kachhadiya*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Deceptron模块，通过双向学习局部逆函数来改善病态逆问题的求解效率，结合多种训练约束和Jacobian组合惩罚，在多个物理逆问题上实现显著加速收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物理科学中的逆问题通常在输入空间是病态的，导致步长敏感。需要开发轻量级方法来改善逆问题的求解效率和收敛性。

Method: Deceptron双向模块学习可微分前向代理的局部逆函数，训练结合监督拟合、前后一致性、轻量谱惩罚、软偏置绑定和Jacobian组合惩罚(JCP)。求解时使用D-IPG方法在输出空间进行下降步。

Result: 在Heat-1D初始条件恢复和阻尼振荡器逆问题上，D-IPG达到固定归一化容差所需的迭代次数比投影梯度少约20倍(Heat)和2-3倍(Oscillator)，与Gauss-Newton方法竞争。

Conclusion: Deceptron方法通过局部逆学习和Jacobian组合惩罚有效改善逆问题的求解效率，在多个测试问题上展现出显著加速收敛效果。

Abstract: Inverse problems in the physical sciences are often ill-conditioned in input space, making progress step-size sensitive. We propose the Deceptron, a lightweight bidirectional module that learns a local inverse of a differentiable forward surrogate. Training combines a supervised fit, forward-reverse consistency, a lightweight spectral penalty, a soft bias tie, and a Jacobian Composition Penalty (JCP) that encourages $J_g(f(x))\,J_f(x)\!\approx\!I$ via JVP/VJP probes. At solve time, D-IPG (Deceptron Inverse-Preconditioned Gradient) takes a descent step in output space, pulls it back through $g$, and projects under the same backtracking and stopping rules as baselines. On Heat-1D initial-condition recovery and a Damped Oscillator inverse problem, D-IPG reaches a fixed normalized tolerance with $\sim$20$\times$ fewer iterations on Heat and $\sim$2-3$\times$ fewer on Oscillator than projected gradient, competitive in iterations and cost with Gauss-Newton. Diagnostics show JCP reduces a measured composition error and tracks iteration gains. We also preview a single-scale 2D instantiation, DeceptronNet (v0), that learns few-step corrections under a strict fairness protocol and exhibits notably fast convergence.

*Ivan Novikov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MLPMoE是一种无需训练、确定性的转换方法，将Transformer块中的密集MLP重构为静态高基数混合专家模型，通过张量切片和求和实现，无需梯度、校准集或路由器训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型作为密集Transformer部署，计算效率低下，推理成本随参数数量线性增长。现有方法依赖聚类、激活分析等复杂技术，需要校准数据。

Method: 使用张量切片和求和的代数方法，将张量并行性重新解释为拓扑转换而非分布式训练模式，并引入Fractal Fade和Compensated Pruning实现结构化稀疏性。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-0.5B和DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B模型上，零样本MLPMoE转换使代理困惑度指标变化小于0.05%，同时保持参数数量基本不变。在8B模型上，差分稀疏性移除约20%的MLP参数，困惑度保持在密集基线的约2%以内。

Conclusion: 该方法完全事后处理现有检查点，无需梯度、校准集或路由器训练，提供了一种高效的计算优化方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are predominantly deployed as dense transformers, where every parameter in every feed-forward block is activated for every token. While architecturally simple, this is computationally inefficient, since inference costs scale linearly with parameter count. Recent upcycling methods such as MoEfication, CMoE, ToMoE, and MoORE reveal that much of the useful computation lives in sparse, semi-modular substructures inside dense feed-forward networks, but these approaches typically rely on clustering, activation profiling, singular value decomposition, or custom routing that requires calibration data. This paper introduces MLPMoE (MLP Mixture-of-Experts), a training-free, deterministic transformation that restructures the dense MLP in transformer blocks into a static, high-cardinality mixture of experts. The transformation uses simple tensor slicing and summation, reinterpreting the algebra of tensor parallelism as a topological conversion rather than a distributed training pattern. We further introduce Fractal Fade (differential branch sparsity) and Compensated Pruning (variance-preserving branch reduction) as lightweight mechanisms for structured sparsity. On Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B, the zero-shot MLPMoE transform changes a proxy perplexity metric by less than 0.05 percent while keeping the parameter count effectively constant. On the 8B model, differential sparsity removes about 20 percent of MLP parameters while keeping perplexity within about 2 percent of the dense baseline. The method operates entirely post hoc on existing checkpoints and does not require gradients, calibration sets, or router training.

Motivation: 传统基于关键词检索或线性映射的元分析方法往往忽略了大脑中丰富的层次结构，需要一种能够同时处理语义相似性和层次组织的方法。

Method: 使用Lorentz模型将研究文献文本和对应的脑图像嵌入到共享的双曲空间中，通过三个步骤进行多级神经影像元分析：脑-文本嵌入对齐、文本-脑激活层次引导、脑激活模式层次关系保持。

Result: 实验结果表明，该模型优于基线方法，提供了一个鲁棒且可解释的多级神经影像元分析范式。

Conclusion: 通过双曲脑-文本表示，该方法能够有效进行多级神经影像元分析，捕捉神经影像数据中的语义和层次信息。

Abstract: Various neuroimaging studies suffer from small sample size problem which often limit their reliability. Meta-analysis addresses this challenge by aggregating findings from different studies to identify consistent patterns of brain activity. However, traditional approaches based on keyword retrieval or linear mappings often overlook the rich hierarchical structure in the brain. In this work, we propose a novel framework that leverages hyperbolic geometry to bridge the gap between neuroscience literature and brain activation maps. By embedding text from research articles and corresponding brain images into a shared hyperbolic space via the Lorentz model, our method captures both semantic similarity and hierarchical organization inherent in neuroimaging data. In the hyperbolic space, our method performs multi-level neuroimaging meta-analysis (MNM) by 1) aligning brain and text embeddings for semantic correspondence, 2) guiding hierarchy between text and brain activations, and 3) preserving the hierarchical relationships within brain activation patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms baselines, offering a robust and interpretable paradigm of multi-level neuroimaging meta-analysis via hyperbolic brain-text representation.

Conclusion: 这是首次在如此大规模下成功将完整的目标感知注意力序列建模部署到早期排序阶段，有效平衡了推荐系统的效果和效率。

Abstract: Large-scale recommendations commonly adopt a multi-stage cascading ranking system paradigm to balance effectiveness and efficiency. Early Stage Ranking (ESR) systems utilize the "user-item decoupling" approach, where independently learned user and item representations are only combined at the final layer. While efficient, this design is limited in effectiveness, as it struggles to capture fine-grained user-item affinities and cross-signals. To address these, we propose the Generative Early Stage Ranking (GESR) paradigm, introducing the Mixture of Attention (MoA) module which leverages diverse attention mechanisms to bridge the effectiveness gap: the Hard Matching Attention (HMA) module encodes explicit cross-signals by computing raw match counts between user and item features; the Target-Aware Self Attention module generates target-aware user representations conditioned on the item, enabling more personalized learning; and the Cross Attention modules facilitate early and more enriched interactions between user-item features. MoA's specialized attention encodings are further refined in the final layer through a Multi-Logit Parameterized Gating (MLPG) module, which integrates the newly learned embeddings via gating and produces secondary logits that are fused with the primary logit. To address the efficiency and latency challenges, we have introduced a comprehensive suite of optimization techniques. These span from custom kernels that maximize the capabilities of the latest hardware to efficient serving solutions powered by caching mechanisms. The proposed GESR paradigm has shown substantial improvements in topline metrics, engagement, and consumption tasks, as validated by both offline and online experiments. To the best of our knowledge, this marks the first successful deployment of full target-aware attention sequence modeling within an ESR stage at such a scale.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了Explore-Then-Exploit (ETE)解码策略，通过探索高不确定性token来提升扩散语言模型的解码效率，突破了传统依赖高置信度token的信息瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准DLM解码策略依赖高置信度token会遭遇信息理论瓶颈，限制解码进度并减慢生成速度，因为高概率token携带的信息量很小。

Method: 提出ETE解码策略，结合跨块解码和对高不确定性token的针对性探索，重塑条件分布并触发级联的自信预测。

Result: 实验验证了理论界限，ETE相比仅依赖置信度的基线方法，在不影响生成质量的情况下持续减少了所需的解码轮数。

Conclusion: 优先处理高置信度token本质上是低效的，ETE策略通过最大化信息吞吐量和解码效率，有效解决了DLM解码中的信息瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have recently emerged as a strong alternative to autoregressive language models (LMs). DLMs offer comparable accuracy with faster inference speed via parallel decoding. However, standard DLM decoding strategies relying on high-confidence tokens encounter an inherent information-theoretic bottleneck that restricts decoding progress and ultimately slows generation. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that prioritizing high-confidence tokens is inherently inefficient. High-probability tokens carry negligible information and strictly relying on them limits the effective progress made in each decoding round. We prove that the number of decoding rounds must grow linearly with the sample's total information (negative log-likelihood) and inversely with the per-round information budget, establishing a bits-to-rounds principle. We also propose Explore-Then-Exploit (ETE), a training-free decoding strategy that maximizes information throughput and decoding efficiency. ETE combines cross-block decoding with targeted exploration of high-uncertainty tokens to reshape the conditional distribution and trigger cascades of confident predictions. Experiments verify our theoretical bounds and demonstrate that ETE consistently reduces the required number of decoding rounds compared to confidence-only baselines without compromising generation quality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BRIDGE提出了一种结构化提示方法，将验证程序生成分解为代码、规范和证明三个领域，通过领域对齐显著提升验证合成的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在代码生成方面表现优异，但在程序验证（特别是Lean4等交互式证明框架中）存在挑战，主要问题是可扩展性：验证合成需要代码、精确规范和正确证明，而现有方法很少能同时涵盖这三个领域。

Method: BRIDGE将验证分解为三个相互关联的领域：代码（可执行实现）、规范（形式化意图声明）和证明（构造性正确性论证），通过激发不同的推理行为（功能性、规范驱动和证明导向）作为中间表示来连接这些领域。

Result: 功能推理将形式语言（Lean4）中代码的正确性提高了近1.5倍（pass@5），推理时间计算效率提高2倍；规范驱动提示将Python编码通过率提升高达17.5%。

Conclusion: 结构化领域对齐是推进验证合成的有前景方向，BRIDGE为通过专家迭代或RLVR进行训练奠定了基础，使模型能够在代码、规范和证明中内化这些推理策略。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in code generation, yet struggle with program verification, especially in interactive proof frameworks such as Lean4. A central challenge is scalability: verified synthesis requires not just code, but also precise specifications and correctness proofs, and existing approaches rarely span all three domains. We present BRIDGE, the first systematic study of structured prompting for scalable verified program generation. BRIDGE decomposes verification into three interconnected domains: Code (executable implementations), Specifications (formal intent statements), and Proofs (constructive correctness arguments). Our key idea is to elicit distinct reasoning behaviors functional, specification-driven, and proof-oriented as intermediate representations that preserve semantic structure and connect these domains. Through systematic ablations, we show that this approach substantially improves both accuracy and efficiency beyond standard error feedback methods. For example, functional reasoning improves correctness of code in formal languages (Lean4) by nearly 1.5x (pass@5) over direct baselines. In inference-time compute, functional reasoning is also 2x more efficient, achieving higher pass rates with fewer generations and lower total sampling budgets. Similarly, we find that specification-driven prompting boosts Python coding pass rates by up to 17.5%. These findings suggest that structured domain alignment is a promising direction for advancing verified synthesis. BRIDGE establishes a foundation for training via expert iteration or RLVR, enabling models to internalize these reasoning strategies across code, specifications, and proofs.

Conclusion: 提出的动态分层对比训练框架能够有效建模节点间的细微语义差异，显著提升分支准确性和求解效率，特别是在上游节点处理方面表现优异，具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a fundamental class of NP-hard problems that has garnered significant attention from both academia and industry. The Branch-and-Bound (B\&B) method is the dominant approach for solving MILPs and the branching plays an important role in B\&B methods. Neural-based learning frameworks have recently been developed to enhance branching policies and the efficiency of solving MILPs. However, these methods still struggle with semantic variation across depths, the scarcity of upstream nodes, and the costly collection of strong branching samples. To address these issues, we propose \ours, a Dynamic \underline{\textbf{S}}tratified \underline{\textbf{C}}ontrastive Training Framework for \underline{\textbf{MILP}} Branching. It groups branch-and-bound nodes based on their feature distributions and trains a GCNN-based discriminative model to progressively separate nodes across groups, learning finer-grained node representations throughout the tree. To address data scarcity and imbalance at upstream nodes, we introduce an upstream-augmented MILP derivation procedure that generates both theoretically equivalent and perturbed instances. \ours~effectively models subtle semantic differences between nodes, significantly enhancing branching accuracy and solving efficiency, particularly for upstream nodes. Extensive experiments on standard MILP benchmarks demonstrate that our method enhances branching accuracy, reduces solving time, and generalizes effectively to unseen instances.

Abstract: Fair clustering has gained increasing attention in recent years, especially in applications involving socially sensitive attributes. However, existing fair clustering methods often lack interpretability, limiting their applicability in high-stakes scenarios where understanding the rationale behind clustering decisions is essential. In this work, we address this limitation by proposing an interpretable and fair clustering framework, which integrates fairness constraints into the structure of decision trees. Our approach constructs interpretable decision trees that partition the data while ensuring fair treatment across protected groups. To further enhance the practicality of our framework, we also introduce a variant that requires no fairness hyperparameter tuning, achieved through post-pruning a tree constructed without fairness constraints. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method not only delivers competitive clustering performance and improved fairness, but also offers additional advantages such as interpretability and the ability to handle multiple sensitive attributes. These strengths enable our method to perform robustly under complex fairness constraints, opening new possibilities for equitable and transparent clustering.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is retracing the Internet's path from centralized provision to distributed creation. Initially, resource-intensive computation concentrates within institutions capable of training and serving large models.Eventually, as federated learning matures, billions of edge devices holding sensitive data will be able to collectively improve models without surrendering raw information, enabling both contribution and consumption at scale. This democratic vision remains unrealized due to certain compositional gaps; aggregators handle updates without accountability, economic mechanisms are lacking and even when present remain vulnerable to gaming, coordination serializes state modifications limiting scalability, and governance permits retroactive manipulation. This work addresses these gaps by leveraging cryptographic receipts to prove aggregation correctness, geometric novelty measurement to prevent incentive gaming, parallel object ownership to achieve linear scalability, and time-locked policies to check retroactive manipulation.

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够有效校正LLM评估偏差并量化不确定性，为LLM评估提供了更可靠的统计基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as evaluators in lieu of humans. While scalable, their judgments are noisy due to imperfect specificity and sensitivity of LLMs, leading to biased accuracy estimates. Although bias-correction methods exist, they are underutilized in LLM research and typically assume exact knowledge of the model's specificity and sensitivity. Furthermore, in general we only have estimates of these values and it is not well known how to properly construct confidence intervals using only estimates. This work presents a simple plug-in framework that corrects such bias and constructs confidence intervals reflecting uncertainty from both test and calibration dataset, enabling practical and statistically sound LLM-based evaluation. Additionally, to reduce uncertainty in the accuracy estimate, we introduce an adaptive algorithm that efficiently allocates calibration sample sizes.

Abstract: Understanding how chemical perturbations propagate through biological systems is essential for robust molecular property prediction. While most existing methods focus on chemical structures alone, recent advances highlight the crucial role of cellular responses such as morphology and gene expression in shaping drug effects. However, current cell-aware approaches face two key limitations: (1) modality incompleteness in external biological data, and (2) insufficient modeling of hierarchical dependencies across molecular, cellular, and genomic levels. We propose CHMR (Cell-aware Hierarchical Multi-modal Representations), a robust framework that jointly models local-global dependencies between molecules and cellular responses and captures latent biological hierarchies via a novel tree-structured vector quantization module. Evaluated on nine public benchmarks spanning 728 tasks, CHMR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, yielding average improvements of 3.6% on classification and 17.2% on regression tasks. These results demonstrate the advantage of hierarchy-aware, multimodal learning for reliable and biologically grounded molecular representations, offering a generalizable framework for integrative biomedical modeling.

Abstract: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) has emerged as a critical tool for extracting fine-grained sentiment insights from user-generated content, particularly in e-commerce and social media domains. However, research on Bangla ABSA remains significantly underexplored due to the absence of comprehensive datasets and specialized frameworks for triplet extraction in this language. This paper introduces BanglaASTE, a novel framework for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) that simultaneously identifies aspect terms, opinion expressions, and sentiment polarities from Bangla product reviews. Our contributions include: (1) creation of the first annotated Bangla ASTE dataset containing 3,345 product reviews collected from major e-commerce platforms including Daraz, Facebook, and Rokomari; (2) development of a hybrid classification framework that employs graph-based aspect-opinion matching with semantic similarity techniques; and (3) implementation of an ensemble model combining BanglaBERT contextual embeddings with XGBoost boosting algorithms for enhanced triplet extraction performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our ensemble approach achieves superior performance with 89.9% accuracy and 89.1% F1-score, significantly outperforming baseline models across all evaluation metrics. The framework effectively addresses key challenges in Bangla text processing including informal expressions, spelling variations, and data sparsity. This research advances the state-of-the-art in low-resource language sentiment analysis and provides a scalable solution for Bangla e-commerce analytics applications.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as prominent candidates for embedded and edge AI. Their inherent low power consumption makes them far more efficient than conventional ANNs in scenarios where energy budgets are tightly constrained. In parallel, federated learning (FL) has become the prevailing training paradigm in such settings, enabling on-device learning while limiting the exposure of raw data. However, gradient inversion attacks represent a critical privacy threat in FL, where sensitive training data can be reconstructed directly from shared gradients. While this vulnerability has been widely investigated in conventional ANNs, its implications for SNNs remain largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first comprehensive empirical study of gradient leakage in SNNs across diverse data domains. SNNs are inherently non-differentiable and are typically trained using surrogate gradients, which we hypothesized would be less correlated with the original input and thus less informative from a privacy perspective. To investigate this, we adapt different gradient leakage attacks to the spike domain. Our experiments reveal a striking contrast with conventional ANNs: whereas ANN gradients reliably expose salient input content, SNN gradients yield noisy, temporally inconsistent reconstructions that fail to recover meaningful spatial or temporal structure. These results indicate that the combination of event-driven dynamics and surrogate-gradient training substantially reduces gradient informativeness. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first systematic benchmark of gradient inversion attacks for spiking architectures, highlighting the inherent privacy-preserving potential of neuromorphic computation.

Abstract: Accurate remaining useful life (RUL) prediction hinges on the quality of health indicators (HIs), yet existing methods often fail to disentangle complex degradation mechanisms in multi-sensor systems or quantify uncertainty in HI reliability. This paper introduces a novel framework for HI construction, advancing three key contributions. First, we adapt Reconstruction along Projected Pathways (RaPP) as a health indicator (HI) for RUL prediction for the first time, showing that it outperforms traditional reconstruction error metrics. Second, we show that augmenting RaPP-derived HIs with aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty quantification (UQ) via Monte Carlo dropout and probabilistic latent spaces- significantly improves RUL-prediction robustness. Third, and most critically, we propose indicator groups, a paradigm that isolates sensor subsets to model system-specific degradations, giving rise to our novel method, I-GLIDE which enables interpretable, mechanism-specific diagnostics. Evaluated on data sourced from aerospace and manufacturing systems, our approach achieves marked improvements in accuracy and generalizability compared to state-of-the-art HI methods while providing actionable insights into system failure pathways. This work bridges the gap between anomaly detection and prognostics, offering a principled framework for uncertainty-aware degradation modeling in complex systems.

Abstract: Gene prioritization (identifying genes potentially associated with a biological process) is increasingly tackled with Artificial Intelligence. However, existing methods struggle with the high dimensionality and incomplete labelling of biomedical data. This work proposes a more robust and efficient pipeline that leverages Fast-mRMR feature selection to retain only relevant, non-redundant features for classifiers. This enables us to build simpler and more effective models, as well as to combine different biological feature sets. Experiments on Dietary Restriction datasets show significant improvements over existing methods, proving that feature selection can be critical for reliable gene prioritization.

Motivation: 标准Transformer架构的刚性、均匀计算分配限制了其效率和可扩展性，特别是在大规模模型和长序列处理中。

Method: SDT在解码器堆栈中交替使用决策层和动态层，决策层计算完整后验和轻量先验，动态层基于贝叶斯惊喜进行Top-K路由；STT通过转移网络预测残差更新，形成时间变化假设，指导路由器动态执行或跳过Transformer块。

Conclusion: 提出的架构为效率建立了灵活框架，为更高效模型设定了路径，初步揭示了条件计算在计算精度权衡方面的潜力。

Abstract: The rigid, uniform allocation of computation in standard Transformer (TF) architectures can limit their efficiency and scalability, particularly for large-scale models and long sequences. Addressing this, we introduce Subjective Depth Transformers (SDT) and Subjective Timescale Transformers (STT), two distinct architectures that leverage Bayesian surprise signals to dynamically route computation, learning where and when to compute within decoder-only TFs. SDT augments a decoder-only stack with alternating Decision and Dynamic layers: a Decision layer computes a full block 'posterior' and a lightweight 'prior,' while a Dynamic layer employs fixed-capacity Top-K routing based on Bayesian surprise (Expected and Unexpected Change), maintaining a static compute graph. STT extends this conditional computation to the temporal domain: a transition network predicts residual updates, forming a temporal 'change hypothesis' that informs a router to dynamically execute or bypass TF blocks for each token, managing KV-cache contributions. Both architectures exhibit the predicted shift from novelty to prediction driven gating over training, suggesting alignment with surprise based principles. While operating at reduced capacity, they offer preliminary insights into the compute-accuracy trade-offs of conditional computation. The proposed architectures establish a flexible framework for efficiency, reducing self-attention computation by 75% and KV-cache requirements by 50% within each compute skipping layer, setting a pathway for more efficient models.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient seismic response prediction is essential for the design of resilient structures. While the Finite Element Method (FEM) remains the standard for nonlinear seismic analysis, its high computational demands limit its scalability and real time applicability. Recent developments in deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models, have shown promise in reducing the computational cost of nonlinear seismic analysis of structures. However, these data driven models often struggle to generalize and capture the underlying physics, leading to reduced reliability. We propose a novel Physics Informed U Net LSTM framework that integrates physical laws with deep learning to enhance both accuracy and efficiency. By embedding domain specific constraints into the learning process, the proposed model achieves improved predictive performance over conventional Machine Learning architectures. This hybrid approach bridges the gap between purely data driven methods and physics based modeling, offering a robust and computationally efficient alternative for seismic response prediction of structures.

To this end, we present a conditional score network for time-series synthesis, deriving a denoising score matching loss tailored for our purposes. In particular, our presented denoising score matching loss is the conditional denoising score matching loss for time-series synthesis. In addition, our framework is such flexible that both regular and irregular time-series can be synthesized with minimal changes to our model design. Finally, we obtain exceptional synthesis performance on various time-series datasets, achieving state-of-the-art sampling diversity and quality.

Conclusion: 揭示了当前MDLM训练范式的关键局限性，为构建具有更强上下文理解能力的基于扩散的语言模型提供了可行见解

Abstract: Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to Autoregressive Language Models (ARLMs), leveraging a denoising objective that, in principle, should enable more uniform context utilisation. In this work, we examine the context comprehension abilities of MDLMs and uncover two key limitations. First, despite their more global training objective and bidirectional attention mechanism, similarly to ARLMS, MDLMs exhibit a strong locality bias: performance is highly sensitive to the position of relevant information within the input, favouring local over distant context. Second, we show that appending a large number of mask tokens--required for generation--can significantly degrade context comprehension. Through systematic ablations, we find that these masks act as distractors, reducing the model's ability to process relevant information. To address this, we introduce a mask-agnostic loss function that encourages predictions to remain invariant to the number of appended masks. Fine-tuning with this objective substantially mitigates the distracting effect of masks, improving robustness of MDLMs. Overall, our findings reveal critical limitations of the current MDLM training paradigm and provide actionable insights for building diffusion-based language models with stronger context comprehension.

Conclusion: 将监督信号融入逆强化学习具有显著优势，H-AIRL为处理挑战性现实世界问题提供了有前景的框架。

Abstract: Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning (AIRL) has shown promise in addressing the sparse reward problem in reinforcement learning (RL) by inferring dense reward functions from expert demonstrations. However, its performance in highly complex, imperfect-information settings remains largely unexplored. To explore this gap, we evaluate AIRL in the context of Heads-Up Limit Hold'em (HULHE) poker, a domain characterized by sparse, delayed rewards and significant uncertainty. In this setting, we find that AIRL struggles to infer a sufficiently informative reward function. To overcome this limitation, we contribute Hybrid-AIRL (H-AIRL), an extension that enhances reward inference and policy learning by incorporating a supervised loss derived from expert data and a stochastic regularization mechanism. We evaluate H-AIRL on a carefully selected set of Gymnasium benchmarks and the HULHE poker setting. Additionally, we analyze the learned reward function through visualization to gain deeper insights into the learning process. Our experimental results show that H-AIRL achieves higher sample efficiency and more stable learning compared to AIRL. This highlights the benefits of incorporating supervised signals into inverse RL and establishes H-AIRL as a promising framework for tackling challenging, real-world settings.

Result: 在两个数据集(皮肤病变图像和金融表格数据)、两个黑盒模型、七种解释算法和广泛超参数范围内评估了4744个不同解释，结果显示DPC与PC一起实现了对基线导向和局部特征归因方法的全面且计算高效的评估。

Conclusion: DPC指标提供了确定性、可重现的评估结果，显著提升了评估效率，特别适用于需要高可信度的医疗等高风险应用场景。

Abstract: The utility of an explanation method critically depends on its fidelity to the underlying machine learning model. Especially in high-stakes medical settings, clinicians and regulators require explanations that faithfully reflect the model's decision process. Existing fidelity metrics such as Infidelity rely on Monte Carlo approximation, which demands numerous model evaluations and introduces uncertainty due to random sampling. This work proposes a novel metric for evaluating the fidelity of local feature attribution methods by modifying the existing Prediction Change (PC) metric within the Guided Perturbation Experiment. By incorporating the direction of both perturbation and attribution, the proposed Directed Prediction Change (DPC) metric achieves an almost tenfold speedup and eliminates randomness, resulting in a deterministic and trustworthy evaluation procedure that measures the same property as local Infidelity. DPC is evaluated on two datasets (skin lesion images and financial tabular data), two black-box models, seven explanation algorithms, and a wide range of hyperparameters. Across $4\,744$ distinct explanations, the results demonstrate that DPC, together with PC, enables a holistic and computationally efficient evaluation of both baseline-oriented and local feature attribution methods, while providing deterministic and reproducible outcomes.

Abstract: Natural disasters remain a major challenge for Bangladesh, so real-time monitoring and quick response systems are essential. In this study, we present BanglaMM-Disaster, an end-to-end deep learning-based multimodal framework for disaster classification in Bangla, using both textual and visual data from social media. We constructed a new dataset of 5,037 Bangla social media posts, each consisting of a caption and a corresponding image, annotated into one of nine disaster-related categories. The proposed model integrates transformer-based text encoders, including BanglaBERT, mBERT, and XLM-RoBERTa, with CNN backbones such as ResNet50, DenseNet169, and MobileNetV2, to process the two modalities. Using early fusion, the best model achieves 83.76% accuracy. This surpasses the best text-only baseline by 3.84% and the image-only baseline by 16.91%. Our analysis also shows reduced misclassification across all classes, with noticeable improvements for ambiguous examples. This work fills a key gap in Bangla multimodal disaster analysis and demonstrates the benefits of combining multiple data types for real-time disaster response in low-resource settings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: QK norm虽然能解决transformer训练稳定性问题，但不适用于MLA等不需要在推理时完全实例化queries和keys的场景，因此需要一种更通用的稳定性解决方案。

Method: 通过为query和key权重分配参数相关学习率来控制logits的变化，这是一种廉价干预方法。

Result: 该方法允许提高网络的基础学习率，在MLA设置中优于其他方法，在使用多头注意力时性能与QK norm相当。

Conclusion: 控制logits变化是确保transformer训练稳定性的有效方法，通过参数相关学习率干预可以实现这一目标。

Abstract: Stability of neural network weights is critical when training transformer models. The query and key weights are particularly problematic, as they tend to grow large without any intervention. Applying normalization to queries and keys, known as `QK norm', fixes stability issues in practice, but is not always applicable. For example, QK norm is not compatible with Multi Latent Attention (MLA) because QK norm requires full materialization of queries and keys during inference, which is not done in MLA. In this paper we suggest that controlling the changes to logits is important for stability. We show that these changes are controllable by assigning parameter-dependent learning rates to the query and key weights. We find that our cheap intervention allows us to increase the base learning rate of the network, outperform other methods in the MLA setting, and achieve performance competitive with QK norm when using Multi-head Attention.

Conclusion: AAR为污染数据集提供了可扩展且可靠的解决方案，增强了鲁棒性，为安全和医疗等领域的实际应用铺平了道路

Abstract: Handling contaminated data poses a critical challenge in anomaly detection, as traditional models assume training on purely normal data. Conventional methods mitigate contamination by relying on fixed contamination ratios, but discrepancies between assumed and actual ratios can severely degrade performance, especially in noisy environments where normal and abnormal data distributions overlap. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive and Aggressive Rejection (AAR), a novel method that dynamically excludes anomalies using a modified z-score and Gaussian mixture model-based thresholds. AAR effectively balances the trade-off between preserving normal data and excluding anomalies by integrating hard and soft rejection strategies. Extensive experiments on two image datasets and thirty tabular datasets demonstrate that AAR outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 0.041 AUROC.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了浅层通用多项式网络（SUPNs），用单层可学习系数的多项式替代除最后一层外的所有隐藏层，以更少的参数实现足够的表达能力，在近似误差和变异性上优于DNNs和KANs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络和Kolmogorov-Arnold网络通常需要大量可训练参数，导致网络不透明且优化空间大，容易产生泛化误差差异大的局部最小值。网络初始化对模型外样本精度影响过大。

Method: 用单层可学习系数的多项式替换除最后一层外的所有隐藏层，结合DNNs和多项式的优势，推导出准最优SUPN参数的显式公式。

Result: 在超过13,000个训练模型的一维、二维和十维数值实验中，对于给定数量的可训练参数，SUPNs的近似误差和变异性通常比DNNs和KANs低一个数量级。在非光滑函数上甚至优于多项式投影。

Conclusion: SUPNs以更少的参数实现了与最佳多项式近似相同的收敛速度，在近似精度和稳定性方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) are popular methods for function approximation due to their flexibility and expressivity. However, they typically require a large number of trainable parameters to produce a suitable approximation. Beyond making the resulting network less transparent, overparameterization creates a large optimization space, likely producing local minima in training that have quite different generalization errors. In this case, network initialization can have an outsize impact on the model's out-of-sample accuracy. For these reasons, we propose shallow universal polynomial networks (SUPNs). These networks replace all but the last hidden layer with a single layer of polynomials with learnable coefficients, leveraging the strengths of DNNs and polynomials to achieve sufficient expressivity with far fewer parameters. We prove that SUPNs converge at the same rate as the best polynomial approximation of the same degree, and we derive explicit formulas for quasi-optimal SUPN parameters. We complement theory with an extensive suite of numerical experiments involving SUPNs, DNNs, KANs, and polynomial projection in one, two, and ten dimensions, consisting of over 13,000 trained models. On the target functions we numerically studied, for a given number of trainable parameters, the approximation error and variability are often lower for SUPNs than for DNNs and KANs by an order of magnitude. In our examples, SUPNs even outperform polynomial projection on non-smooth functions.

Result: 实验在真实世界和合成数据集上验证了理论估计的有效性。对于鲁棒集成方法如OzaBagging，理论估计能有效识别性能饱和点；对于复杂加权方案如GOOWE，高理论多样性可能引发算法不稳定性。

Conclusion: 线性独立性是集成学习性能的关键因素，理论框架能有效指导集成规模的选择，但需考虑具体算法的特性以避免不稳定性。

Abstract: Ensemble learning improves classification performance by combining multiple base classifiers. While increasing the number of classifiers generally enhances accuracy, excessively large ensembles can lead to computational inefficiency and diminishing returns. This paper investigates the relationship between ensemble size and performance through the lens of linear independence among classifier votes in data streams. We propose that ensembles composed of linearly independent classifiers maximize representational capacity, particularly under a geometric model. We then generalize the importance of linear independence to the weighted majority voting problem. By modeling the probability of achieving linear independence among classifier outputs, we derive a theoretical framework that explains the trade-off between ensemble size and accuracy. Our analysis leads to a theoretical estimate of the ensemble size required to achieve a user-specified probability of linear independence. We validate our theory through experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets using two ensemble methods, OzaBagging and GOOWE. Our results confirm that this theoretical estimate effectively identifies the point of performance saturation for robust ensembles like OzaBagging. Conversely, for complex weighting schemes like GOOWE, our framework reveals that high theoretical diversity can trigger algorithmic instability. Our implementation is publicly available to support reproducibility and future research.

Motivation: 研究CBO在神经网络训练中的性能，特别是在多任务学习场景下减少内存开销，并探索CBO在无限粒子极限下的理论性质。

Method: 使用基于粒子的CBO方法训练两层神经网络，开发CBO与Adam的混合方法，在多任务学习中重新表述CBO以减少内存使用，并在最优传输框架下重新表述CBO。

Result: 混合CBO-Adam方法比纯CBO收敛更快；在多任务学习中CBO重新表述减少了内存开销；在无限粒子极限下，Wasserstein-over-Wasserstein空间中的方差单调递减。

Conclusion: CBO是神经网络训练的有效方法，与Adam结合可加速收敛，在多任务学习中具有内存优势，其理论性质在无限粒子极限下得到验证。

Abstract: We study two-layer neural networks and train these with a particle-based method called consensus-based optimization (CBO). We compare the performance of CBO against Adam on two test cases and demonstrate how a hybrid approach, combining CBO with Adam, provides faster convergence than CBO. In the context of multi-task learning, we recast CBO into a formulation that offers less memory overhead. The CBO method allows for a mean-field limit formulation, which we couple with the mean-field limit of the neural network. To this end, we first reformulate CBO within the optimal transport framework. Finally, in the limit of infinitely many particles, we define the corresponding dynamics on the Wasserstein-over-Wasserstein space and show that the variance decreases monotonically.

*Qian Hong,Cheng Bian,Xiao Zhou,Xiaoyu Li,Yelei Li,Zijing Zeng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ShiftSyncNet是一个基于元学习的双层优化框架，通过自动校正时间偏移来改善多模态生理信号转换的准确性，在PPG/BCG到ABP转换任务中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态信号转换中的时间错位会严重影响转换精度，特别是对ABP峰值等关键特征的捕捉。传统同步方法依赖强相似性假设或手动调优，而现有的带噪标签学习方法无法有效处理时间偏移监督。

Method: 提出ShiftSyncNet框架，包含转换网络(TransNet)和时间偏移校正网络(SyncNet)。SyncNet学习训练对之间的时间偏移，并通过傅里叶相位偏移来对齐监督信号，采用元学习双层优化方法。

Result: 在一个真实工业数据集和两个公共数据集上的实验表明，ShiftSyncNet分别比强基线方法提升了9.4%、6.0%和12.8%，在多种错位场景下都能有效校正时间偏移并提高转换精度。

Conclusion: ShiftSyncNet通过自动校正时间偏移有效改善了多模态生理信号转换的准确性，为解决多模态生理转换中的时间不一致性问题提供了统一方向。

Abstract: Translating non-invasive signals such as photoplethysmography (PPG) and ballistocardiography (BCG) into clinically meaningful signals like arterial blood pressure (ABP) is vital for continuous, low-cost healthcare monitoring. However, temporal misalignment in multimodal signal transformation impairs transformation accuracy, especially in capturing critical features like ABP peaks. Conventional synchronization methods often rely on strong similarity assumptions or manual tuning, while existing Learning with Noisy Labels (LNL) approaches are ineffective under time-shifted supervision, either discarding excessive data or failing to correct label shifts. To address this challenge, we propose ShiftSyncNet, a meta-learning-based bi-level optimization framework that automatically mitigates performance degradation due to time misalignment. It comprises a transformation network (TransNet) and a time-shift correction network (SyncNet), where SyncNet learns time offsets between training pairs and applies Fourier phase shifts to align supervision signals. Experiments on one real-world industrial dataset and two public datasets show that ShiftSyncNet outperforms strong baselines by 9.4%, 6.0%, and 12.8%, respectively. The results highlight its effectiveness in correcting time shifts, improving label quality, and enhancing transformation accuracy across diverse misalignment scenarios, pointing toward a unified direction for addressing temporal inconsistencies in multimodal physiological transformation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IntAttention是一种完全整数的注意力机制，通过IndexSoftmax操作符在整数域内实现softmax，消除了数据类型转换开销，在边缘设备上实现了显著的加速和能耗降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在边缘设备上部署Transformer模型时，INT8量化虽然加速了矩阵乘法，但softmax成为主要瓶颈，其解量化-softmax-再量化过程占据了高达65%的注意力延迟，并破坏了端到端的整数数据流。

Method: 提出IntAttention，核心是IndexSoftmax操作符，完全在整数域内替换浮点指数运算，集成稀疏感知裁剪、32项查找表近似和直接整数归一化。

Result: 在Armv8 CPU上，相比FP16基线实现了3.7倍加速和61%能耗降低，比传统INT8注意力管道快2.0倍，同时保持与基线相当的高精度。

Conclusion: IntAttention实现了无需重新训练的全整数注意力管道，为边缘设备上的Transformer推理提供了实用高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Deploying Transformer models on edge devices is limited by latency and energy budgets. While INT8 quantization effectively accelerates the primary matrix multiplications, it exposes the softmax as the dominant bottleneck. This stage incurs a costly dequantize-softmax-requantize detour, which can account for up to 65% of total attention latency and disrupts the end-to-end integer dataflow critical for edge hardware efficiency. To address this limitation, we present IntAttention, the first fully integer, plug-and-play attention pipeline without retraining. At the core of our approach lies IndexSoftmax, a hardware-friendly operator that replaces floating-point exponentials entirely within the integer domain. IntAttention integrates sparsity-aware clipping, a 32-entry lookup-table approximation, and direct integer normalization, thereby eliminating all datatype conversion overhead. We evaluate IntAttention and demonstrate consistent and substantial gains. Our method achieves up to 3.7x speedup and 61% energy reduction over FP16 baselines and 2.0x faster than conventional INT8 attention pipelines on Armv8 CPUs. These gains are achieved with high-fidelity accuracy comparable to baselines across diverse language and vision models, enabling practical and efficient Transformer inference on commodity edge devices. Code will be released in later version of this work.

Motivation: Transformer模型在时间序列分类中表现出色，但其内部决策机制复杂且难以理解。现有可解释性方法主要关注输入输出归因，对内部机制揭示不足。

Method: 将机械可解释性技术（激活修补、注意力显著性、稀疏自编码器）从NLP领域适配到时间序列分类Transformer，系统探测注意力头和时间步的因果作用。

Conclusion: 研究为Transformer可解释性提供了方法论贡献，并揭示了时间序列分类任务中Transformer功能机制的新见解。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have become state-of-the-art tools in various machine learning tasks, including time series classification, yet their complexity makes understanding their internal decision-making challenging. Existing explainability methods often focus on input-output attributions, leaving the internal mechanisms largely opaque. This paper addresses this gap by adapting various Mechanistic Interpretability techniques; activation patching, attention saliency, and sparse autoencoders, from NLP to transformer architectures designed explicitly for time series classification. We systematically probe the internal causal roles of individual attention heads and timesteps, revealing causal structures within these models. Through experimentation on a benchmark time series dataset, we construct causal graphs illustrating how information propagates internally, highlighting key attention heads and temporal positions driving correct classifications. Additionally, we demonstrate the potential of sparse autoencoders for uncovering interpretable latent features. Our findings provide both methodological contributions to transformer interpretability and novel insights into the functional mechanics underlying transformer performance in time series classification tasks.

Conclusion: 预测性安全防护方法能够在保持硬安全保证的同时显著提升强化学习性能，对现实应用具有重要价值

Abstract: Obtaining safety guarantees for reinforcement learning is a major challenge to achieve applicability for real-world tasks. Safety shields extend standard reinforcement learning and achieve hard safety guarantees. However, existing safety shields commonly use random sampling of safe actions or a fixed fallback controller, therefore disregarding future performance implications of different safe actions. In this work, we propose a predictive safety shield for model-based reinforcement learning agents in discrete space. Our safety shield updates the Q-function locally based on safe predictions, which originate from a safe simulation of the environment model. This shielding approach improves performance while maintaining hard safety guarantees. Our experiments on gridworld environments demonstrate that even short prediction horizons can be sufficient to identify the optimal path. We observe that our approach is robust to distribution shifts, e.g., between simulation and reality, without requiring additional training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界数据（如气候数据）通常具有空间网格时间序列结构，系统在不同时空点的行为相似但存在变化。这些变化既包含重要信息，又可能影响假设平稳性或空间平移不变性的算法的稳定性和有效性。

Method: 开发了一个模块化框架，通过修改基于约束的因果发现方法中的独立性测试层来实现。该框架能够利用现有因果发现算法（如PC、PC-stable、FCI、PCMCI、PCMCI+、LPCMCI），无需或只需少量修改。

Result: 提出了一个极其模块化、易于扩展且广泛适用的框架，能够系统性地理解和改进一系列子问题，并可以结合变化点检测、聚类、独立性测试等相关领域的见解进行扩展。

Conclusion: 该框架通过将问题分解为更易处理的子问题，简化了对基本限制、控制权衡的超参数以及结果统计解释的理解，提供了一个开源实现。

Abstract: Real-world data, for example in climate applications, often consists of spatially gridded time series data or data with comparable structure. While the underlying system is often believed to behave similar at different points in space and time, those variations that do exist are twofold relevant: They often encode important information in and of themselves. And they may negatively affect the stability / convergence and reliability\Slash{}validity of results of algorithms assuming stationarity or space-translation invariance. We study the information encoded in changes of the causal graph, with stability in mind. An analysis of this general task identifies two core challenges. We develop guiding principles to overcome these challenges, and provide a framework realizing these principles by modifying constraint-based causal discovery approaches on the level of independence testing. This leads to an extremely modular, easily extensible and widely applicable framework. It can leverage existing constraint-based causal discovery methods (demonstrated on IID-algorithms PC, PC-stable, FCI and time series algorithms PCMCI, PCMCI+, LPCMCI) with little to no modification. The built-in modularity allows to systematically understand and improve upon an entire array of subproblems. By design, it can be extended by leveraging insights from change-point-detection, clustering, independence-testing and other well-studied related problems. The division into more accessible sub-problems also simplifies the understanding of fundamental limitations, hyperparameters controlling trade-offs and the statistical interpretation of results. An open-source implementation will be available soon.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效计算战略分类中的最佳响应，特别是在非线性分类器设置中具有实用价值。

Abstract: We consider the problem of strategic classification, where the act of deploying a classifier leads to strategic behaviour that induces a distribution shift on subsequent observations. Current approaches to learning classifiers in strategic settings are focused primarily on the linear setting, but in many cases non-linear classifiers are more suitable. A central limitation to progress for non-linear classifiers arises from the inability to compute best responses in these settings. We present a novel method for computing the best response by optimising the Lagrangian dual of the Agents' objective. We demonstrate that our method reproduces best responses in linear settings, identifying key weaknesses in existing approaches. We present further results demonstrating our method can be straight-forwardly applied to non-linear classifier settings, where it is useful for both evaluation and training.

Abstract: This study proposes a risk prediction method based on a Multi-Scale Temporal Alignment Network (MSTAN) to address the challenges of temporal irregularity, sampling interval differences, and multi-scale dynamic dependencies in Electronic Health Records (EHR). The method focuses on temporal feature modeling by introducing a learnable temporal alignment mechanism and a multi-scale convolutional feature extraction structure to jointly model long-term trends and short-term fluctuations in EHR sequences. At the input level, the model maps multi-source clinical features into a unified high-dimensional semantic space and employs temporal embedding and alignment modules to dynamically weight irregularly sampled data, reducing the impact of temporal distribution differences on model performance. The multi-scale feature extraction module then captures key patterns across different temporal granularities through multi-layer convolution and hierarchical fusion, achieving a fine-grained representation of patient states. Finally, an attention-based aggregation mechanism integrates global temporal dependencies to generate individual-level risk representations for disease risk prediction and health status assessment. Experiments conducted on publicly available EHR datasets show that the proposed model outperforms mainstream baselines in accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-Score, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of multi-scale temporal alignment in complex medical time-series analysis. This study provides a new solution for intelligent representation of high-dimensional asynchronous medical sequences and offers important technical support for EHR-driven clinical risk prediction.

Conclusion: 提出的MD-GAK和PMD-GAK框架在环肽细胞膜渗透性预测中表现优异，特别是PMD-GAK在不确定性校准方面具有优势，方法完全可复现。

Abstract: Cyclic peptides are promising modalities for targeting intracellular sites; however, cell-membrane permeability remains a key bottleneck, exacerbated by limited public data and the need for well-calibrated uncertainty. Instead of relying on data-eager complex deep learning architecture, we propose a monomer-aware decoupled global alignment kernel (MD-GAK), which couples chemically meaningful residue-residue similarity with sequence alignment while decoupling local matches from gap penalties. MD-GAK is a relatively simple kernel. To further demonstrate the robustness of our framework, we also introduce a variant, PMD-GAK, which incorporates a triangular positional prior. As we will show in the experimental section, PMD-GAK can offer additional advantages over MD-GAK, particularly in reducing calibration errors. Since our focus is on uncertainty estimation, we use Gaussian Processes as the predictive model, as both MD-GAK and PMD-GAK can be directly applied within this framework. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods through an extensive set of experiments, comparing our fully reproducible approach against state-of-the-art models, and show that it outperforms them across all metrics.

Abstract: Latent reasoning represents a new development in Transformer language models that has shown potential in compressing reasoning lengths compared to chain-of-thought reasoning. By directly passing the information-rich previous final latent state into the next sequence, latent reasoning removes the restriction to human language tokens as the medium for reasoning. We develop adaptive-length latent reasoning models and introduce a post-SFT reinforcement-learning methodology to optimize latent reasoning length by minimizing reasoning length while maintaining accuracy. This, in turn, further reduces compute usage and raises the bar on the compressive capabilities of latent reasoning models. Experiments on the Llama 3.2 1B model and the GSM8K-Aug dataset show a $52\%$ drop in total reasoning length with no penalty to accuracy. In future work, we plan to extend to additional models and datasets, analyze relationships between training coefficients, experiment with architecture variations, and continue our knowledge distillation for latent reasoning SFT efforts. We make our code and pretrained weights available at https://github.com/apning/adaptive-latent-reasoning.

Abstract: Smart grids are a fusion of classical power infrastructure and advanced communication networks and smart control, to create a cyber-physical environment that is more efficient and flexible than ever before. This integration causes vulnerabilities that can undermine grid stability as well as reliability. Digital forensics is a fundamental concept of learning and identifying, detecting, and mitigating such security incidents. This paper presents an all-in-one machine learning-based digital forensic framework of smart grid systems deployed on the Cloud. The framework combines the data acquisition at the sensor-level, authenticated communication, scalable cloud storage and automated forensic analytics. The model uses supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms - such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosted Trees and deep neural architectures for anomaly detection, event reconstruction and intrusion analysis in real time. After several simulation and experimental studies on real-time smart-meter data streams, the proposed framework is shown to be very accurate, scalable and resilient to cyber-attacks including data tampering, false-data injection and coordinated control-loop manipulation. The results indicate that cloud services are the best backbone for big-data-driven forensic workflows, which allows energy utilities to achieve a fast situational awareness and intelligent incident response.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve state-of-the-art results across many natural language tasks, but their internal mechanisms remain difficult to interpret. In this work, we extract, process, and visualize latent state geometries in Transformer-based language models through dimensionality reduction. We capture layerwise activations at multiple points within Transformer blocks and enable systematic analysis through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Uniform Manifold Approximation (UMAP). We demonstrate experiments on GPT-2 and LLaMa models, where we uncover interesting geometric patterns in latent space. Notably, we identify a clear separation between attention and MLP component outputs across intermediate layers, a pattern not documented in prior work to our knowledge. We also characterize the high norm of latent states at the initial sequence position and visualize the layerwise evolution of latent states. Additionally, we demonstrate the high-dimensional helical structure of GPT-2's positional embeddings, the sequence-wise geometric patterns in LLaMa, and experiment with repeating token sequences. We aim to support systematic analysis of Transformer internals with the goal of enabling further reproducible interpretability research. We make our code available at https://github.com/Vainateya/Feature_Geometry_Visualization.

TL;DR: 研究发现算法效率提升主要依赖于计算规模，而非算法本身的小规模改进。LSTM到Transformer的转换贡献了大部分效率增益，而传统的小规模算法改进仅能解释不到100倍的效率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为2012-2023年间AI训练效率提升了22,000倍主要来自算法改进，但本研究通过实验发现小规模消融实验只能解释不到10倍的效率提升，存在巨大的效率差距需要解释。

Method: 通过小规模消融实验分析关键创新贡献，进行扩展实验比较LSTM和Transformer在不同计算规模下的效率，使用实验外推和文献估计来量化效率增益。

Result: 发现算法效率增益与计算规模密切相关，LSTM到Transformer的转换贡献了大部分效率提升（6,930倍），而其他创新在小规模下效率提升有限。

Conclusion: 小规模模型的算法进展远慢于预期，算法效率的衡量强烈依赖于参考规模，规模依赖的效率改进是解释历史效率提升的关键因素。

Abstract: Algorithms have been estimated to increase AI training FLOP efficiency by a factor of 22,000 between 2012 and 2023 [Ho et al., 2024]. Running small-scale ablation experiments on key innovations from this time period, we are able to account for less than 10x of these gains. Surveying the broader literature, we estimate that additional innovations not included in our ablations account for less than 10x, yielding a total under 100x. This leads us to conduct scaling experiments, which reveal that much of this efficiency gap can be explained by algorithms with scale-dependent efficiency improvements. In particular, we conduct scaling experiments between LSTMs and Transformers, finding exponent differences in their compute-optimal scaling law while finding little scaling difference for many other innovations. These experiments demonstrate that - contrary to standard assumptions - an algorithm's efficiency gains are tied to compute scale. Using experimental extrapolation and literature estimates, we account for 6,930x efficiency gains over the same time period, with the scale-dependent LSTM-to-Transformer transition accounting for the majority of gains. Our results indicate that algorithmic progress for small models has been far slower than previously assumed, and that measures of algorithmic efficiency are strongly reference-dependent.

*Mathew Vanherreweghe,Michael H. Freedman,Keith M. Adams*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现多层感知机在MNIST手写数字分类任务训练中会自发形成Kolmogorov-Arnold几何结构，这种结构在不同空间尺度上保持一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究表明浅层MLP在合成三维任务中会自发形成KAG结构，但尚不清楚这种现象是否会在现实高维场景中持续存在，以及这种几何结构具有何种空间特性。

Method: 将KAG分析扩展到784维的MNIST数字分类任务，使用2层MLP进行系统空间分析，涵盖从局部7像素邻域到完整28x28图像的多尺度分析。

Result: KAG在训练过程中出现，并在不同空间尺度上保持一致，从局部到全局都显示出相同的定性模式，无论采用标准训练还是空间增强训练。

Conclusion: 神经网络在现实高维数据学习过程中会自发发展出有组织的、尺度不变的几何结构。

Abstract: Recent work by Freedman and Mulligan demonstrated that shallow multilayer perceptrons spontaneously develop Kolmogorov-Arnold geometric (KAG) structure during training on synthetic three-dimensional tasks. However, it remained unclear whether this phenomenon persists in realistic high-dimensional settings and what spatial properties this geometry exhibits.
  We extend KAG analysis to MNIST digit classification (784 dimensions) using 2-layer MLPs with systematic spatial analysis at multiple scales. We find that KAG emerges during training and appears consistently across spatial scales, from local 7-pixel neighborhoods to the full 28x28 image. This scale-agnostic property holds across different training procedures: both standard training and training with spatial augmentation produce the same qualitative pattern. These findings reveal that neural networks spontaneously develop organized, scale-invariant geometric structure during learning on realistic high-dimensional data.

*Anantha Padmanaban Krishna Kumar*

TL;DR: 研究发现深度视觉Transformer存在Cliff-Plateau-Climb三阶段模式，[CLS]令牌逐渐边缘化，信息扩散比参数增加更重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度视觉Transformer性能不如浅层模型的问题，挑战传统的缩放假设。

Method: 系统分析ViT-S、ViT-B和ViT-L在ImageNet上的表现，使用信息混洗指数量化信息混合模式。

Result: 发现[CLS]令牌逐渐被补丁令牌的分布式共识取代，ViT-L的信息-任务权衡比ViT-B晚10层出现，这些额外层主要增加信息扩散而非提升性能。

Conclusion: Transformer架构可能从精心校准的深度执行清晰阶段转换中获益更多，而非简单增加参数数量。信息混洗指数可作为现有模型的诊断工具和未来架构的设计目标。

Abstract: Deeper Vision Transformers often perform worse than shallower ones, which challenges common scaling assumptions. Through a systematic empirical analysis of ViT-S, ViT-B, and ViT-L on ImageNet, we identify a consistent three-phase Cliff-Plateau-Climb pattern that governs how representations evolve with depth. We observe that better performance is associated with progressive marginalization of the [CLS] token, originally designed as a global aggregation hub, in favor of distributed consensus among patch tokens. We quantify patterns of information mixing with an Information Scrambling Index, and show that in ViT-L the information-task tradeoff emerges roughly 10 layers later than in ViT-B, and that these additional layers correlate with increased information diffusion rather than improved task performance. Taken together, these results suggest that transformer architectures in this regime may benefit more from carefully calibrated depth that executes clean phase transitions than from simply increasing parameter count. The Information Scrambling Index provides a useful diagnostic for existing models and suggests a potential design target for future architectures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Iterative PPO算法，将多轮对话RL问题转化为一系列单轮RLHF问题，通过交替拟合Q函数和改进策略来优化LLMs在目标导向对话中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化LLMs在多轮目标导向对话中的表现面临挑战，主要由于稀疏的长时程奖励以及响应级规划与令牌级生成之间的不匹配。

Method: 将多轮RL问题形式化地简化为一系列单轮RLHF问题，使用学习到的多轮Q函数作为单轮问题的奖励模型，通过迭代PPO算法交替进行Q函数拟合和策略改进。

Result: 证明了使用标准令牌级PPO解决单轮RL问题等价于在多轮问题中执行策略改进步骤，实现了在线和离线方法之间的平衡。

Conclusion: Iterative PPO方法直接利用稳定的现成单轮RLHF工具，易于实现，在保持在线更新适应性的同时获得了离线训练的稳定性优势。

Abstract: Optimizing large language models (LLMs) for multi-turn conversational outcomes remains a significant challenge, especially in goal-oriented settings like AI marketing or sales agents who facilitate transactions via messaging platforms. The difficulty stems from sparse, long-horizon rewards and the discrepancy between response-level planning and token-level generation. In this technical note, we propose a formal reduction of the multi-turn RL problem into a sequence of single-turn RLHF-style problems. This is achieved by setting a learned multi-turn Q-function as the reward model for the single-turn problem. We demonstrate and prove a key insight: solving this single-turn RL problem with standard token-level PPO is equivalent to a policy improvement step within the multi-turn problem. This insight naturally leads to Iterative PPO, a batch online policy iteration algorithm that alternates between fitting Q-functions from logged conversation trajectories and improving the policy. A major practical advantage is that Iterative PPO directly leverages stable, off-the-shelf single-turn RLHF tools, making it straightforward to implement. Our method occupies a middle ground between fully online and fully offline approaches, retaining the adaptability of online updates while gaining the stability benefits of offline training.

### [280] [EvilGenie: A Reward Hacking Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21654)
*Jonathan Gabor,Jayson Lynch,Jonathan Rosenfeld*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EvilGenie是一个用于评估编程环境中奖励攻击的基准测试，通过三种方法检测奖励攻击行为，发现LLM评判器在明确情况下非常有效，并观察到主流编程代理存在奖励攻击行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前编程代理容易通过硬编码测试用例或编辑测试文件等方式进行奖励攻击，需要建立有效的检测方法来评估和防止这种行为。

Method: 从LiveCodeBench获取问题，创建易于奖励攻击的环境，使用三种方法检测奖励攻击：保留单元测试、LLM评判器和测试文件编辑检测，并验证这些方法的有效性。

Result: LLM评判器在明确情况下能高效检测奖励攻击，保留测试用例的改进效果有限。测试发现Codex和Claude Code存在显性奖励攻击，所有三个代理都有行为不匹配问题。

Conclusion: EvilGenie基准测试有效检测编程代理的奖励攻击行为，LLM评判器是可靠的检测工具，需要进一步研究防止奖励攻击的方法。

Abstract: We introduce EvilGenie, a benchmark for reward hacking in programming settings. We source problems from LiveCodeBench and create an environment in which agents can easily reward hack, such as by hardcoding test cases or editing the testing files. We measure reward hacking in three ways: held out unit tests, LLM judges, and test file edit detection. We verify these methods against human review and each other. We find the LLM judge to be highly effective at detecting reward hacking in unambiguous cases, and observe only minimal improvement from the use of held out test cases. In addition to testing many models using Inspect's basic_agent scaffold, we also measure reward hacking rates for three popular proprietary coding agents: OpenAI's Codex, Anthropic's Claude Code, and Google's Gemini CLI Using GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, respectively. We observe explicit reward hacking by both Codex and Claude Code, and misaligned behavior by all three agents. Our codebase can be found at https://github.com/JonathanGabor/EvilGenie.

TL;DR: RARO是一种基于对抗性逆强化学习的方法，仅使用专家演示就能训练大型语言模型获得强大的推理能力，无需任务特定的验证器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多现实世界的推理密集型任务缺乏验证器，但拥有丰富的专家演示数据，这些数据在推理训练中未被充分利用。

Method: 建立策略（生成器）和相对主义批评器（判别器）之间的对抗性交互：策略学习模仿专家答案，批评器学习比较和区分策略与专家答案。通过强化学习联合持续训练策略和批评器，并应用关键稳定化技术。

Result: 在Countdown、DeepMath和Poetry Writing等评估任务上，RARO显著优于无验证器的基线方法，并展现出与可验证任务上RL相同的稳健扩展趋势。

Conclusion: 该方法仅从专家演示中就能有效激发强大的推理性能，即使在任务特定验证器不可用时也能实现稳健的推理学习。

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) to reason often relies on Reinforcement Learning (RL) with task-specific verifiers. However, many real-world reasoning-intensive tasks lack verifiers, despite offering abundant expert demonstrations that remain under-utilized for reasoning-focused training. We introduce RARO (Relativistic Adversarial Reasoning Optimization) that learns strong reasoning capabilities from only expert demonstrations via Inverse Reinforcement Learning. Our method sets up an adversarial interaction between a policy (generator) and a relativistic critic (discriminator): the policy learns to mimic expert answers, while the critic learns to compare and distinguish between policy and expert answers. Our method trains both the policy and the critic jointly and continuously via RL, and we identify the key stabilization techniques required for robust learning. Empirically, RARO significantly outperforms strong verifier-free baselines on all of our evaluation tasks -- Countdown, DeepMath, and Poetry Writing -- and enjoys the same robust scaling trends as RL on verifiable tasks. These results demonstrate that our method effectively elicits strong reasoning performance from expert demonstrations alone, enabling robust reasoning learning even when task-specific verifiers are unavailable.

Abstract: The rise of AI in telecommunications, from optimizing Radio Access Networks to managing user experience, has sharply increased data volumes and training demands. Telecom data is often noisy, high-dimensional, costly to store, process, and label. Despite Ai's critical role, standard workflows still assume all training samples contribute equally. On the other hand, next generation systems require AI models that are accurate, efficient, and sustainable.The paper questions the assumptions of equal importance by focusing on applying and analyzing the roles of individual samples in telecom training and assessing whether the proposed model optimizes computation and energy use. we perform sample-level gradient analysis across epochs to identify patterns of influence and redundancy in model learning. Based on this, we propose a sample importance framework thats electively prioritizes impactful data and reduces computation without compromising accuracy. Experiments on three real-world telecom datasets show that our method [reserves performance while reducing data needs and computational overhead while advancing the goals of sustainable AI in telecommunications.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) inference often suffers from high decoding latency and limited scalability across heterogeneous edge-cloud environments. Existing speculative decoding (SD) techniques accelerate token generation but remain confined to single-node execution. We propose DSD, a distributed speculative decoding framework that extends SD to multi-device deployments through coordinated draft-target execution. Given the lack of prior work on simulating this paradigm, we first introduce DSD-Sim, a discrete-event simulator that captures network, batching, and scheduling dynamics. Building on insights from DSD-Sim, we further design an Adaptive Window Control (AWC) policy that dynamically adjusts speculation window size to optimize throughput. Experiments across diverse workloads show that DSD achieves up to 1.1x speedup and 9.7% higher throughput over existing SD baselines, enabling agile and scalable LLM serving across edge and cloud.
